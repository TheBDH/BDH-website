		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b>To the Editor:</b></p>
<p class="p3">I am writing this in response to the April 6 op-ed “Inviting Jeb Bush to speak is irresponsible.” Despite the fact I find myself disagreeing with many of the views of Jeb Bush, I believe any respectable educational institution should encourage and seek out diverse opinions.</p>
<p class="p3">Demonizing someone who doesn’t share your perspective or ethical convictions resembles tactics employed by Joseph McCarthy during the Red Scare era in our country.</p>
<p class="p3">I have been guilty of preconceived notions about a person only to be proven wrong after the fact.</p>
<p class="p3">Listening to an opposing opinion often makes you more steadfast in your convictions and that’s a good thing!</p>
<p class="p3">Finally, as the saying goes:</p>
<p class="p3">“I wholly disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Robert Midura</b></p>
<p class="p4">Facilities Management</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Professor brings international science to University</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the midst of the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States competed in virtually every arena, each power vying for the political, economic and military advantage. Yet in 1976, the field of planetary science was united by the efforts of Professor of Geological Science Jim Head, who helped bridge the gap between the rivalling states. At the urging of then University President Howard Swearer and others, Head organized a joint conference between Brown, the Russian Space Research Institute and the Vernadsky Institute, hoping to share scientific progress between the two countries. The conference has continued every year since — even amidst current tension between the countries — and recently included China as well, holding annual sessions in both Moscow, Russia and Houston. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The conference is only one way that Head has connected scientists and inspired those in the field. In his more than four decades at the University, Head has closely collaborated with NASA, taught thousands in his classes and helped secure the role of science in the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Blasting off from Brown</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Following the completion of his undergraduate degree from Washington and Lee University, Head enrolled at Brown for graduate school. He was inspired by Professor Thomas Mutch to pursue planetary science, a field which was relatively unexplored and crucial during the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head found his first job after graduate school by chance, flipping through job openings in book. He stumbled upon a listing for NASA, which read, “Do you want to think your way to the moon and back?” Head helped select the moon landing sites for the Apollo missions and trained astronauts while there, earning him an Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal from the agency in 1971.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a few years at NASA, Head moved back to Brown in 1973 and became an assistant professor. Despite leaving NASA, Head maintained strong ties with the organization and continues to do so to this day. Every year, Head trains astronauts in geology — what he refers to as his introductory class — in the span of a few days to a week. Though the class is typically hosted in Houston, Head has brought the trainees to Brown and given them valuable lessons on College Hill.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head has stayed in touch with dozens of Russian and American scientists at space institutes and connected them to others at the University, some of whom have proven invaluable to research on campus. He brought John Mustard, professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences, on a trip to Russia early in his career, introducing him to scientists there and making connections that Mustard utilized for more than 20 years of research. “He’s really generous with his time and connections. He helps people get up the ladder,” Mustard said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head has also brought many prominent speakers to campus, including David Scott, a former astronaut for the Apollo missions, and Maria Zuber, vice president for research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Head’s former student. Greg Hirth, professor and chair of earth, environmental and planetary sciences, said that “There’s a high level of science that occurs because of his legacy in the department.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Continued Orbit</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head remains an active researcher and educator today. “He’s a rockstar scientist,” Mustard said. According to his Google Scholar page, he has co-authored more than 100 papers in the last four years alone on topics ranging from volcanoes on Venus to water on Mars. He advises and teaches graduate students every year, discussing topics including research in difficult climates such as Antarctica. Though the course will be taught by Mustard this fall, Head has taught GEOL 0050: “Mars, Moon and the Earth” for several years — by his estimate, about 6,000 undergraduates have completed the course.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Unofficially, he remains a steadfast leader within the department. Though they barely collaborate on research, Hirth said that he and Head regularly discuss new projects and ideas. Head is often the first one in the office in the morning — when Hirth arrives at 6:30, he is usually there already.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A visit to Head’s office reveals both his extensive history in the field and his personable character. He has collected dozens of trinkets and toys from his experience and always gives presents to children who visit him. Mustard’s six-year-old son rushes to Head’s office when visiting. “His first instinct is to go knock on his door,” Mustard said. Children have left thank you notes all over his office for gifts given throughout the years, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">More prominently, hundreds of craft beer bottles line the walls of his office. Head is a “beer connoisseur,” as described by Hirth, and will occasionally bring his own personal bottles to department events when the supply does not meet his standard.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head has always and continues to advocate for scientific research. In addition to serving on national committees and lobbying on behalf of the scientific community, he’s a “great strategic thinker,” Mustard said, peppering questions upon faculty in the department and urging them to consider their work in a broader context.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Committee selects ‘Evicted’ as 2022 First Reading</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For over 10 years, the University has asked its incoming first-year students to read a book and engage in a seminar discussion before formally beginning classes in the fall. This year, the First Readings committee has selected “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City” by Matthew Desmond as the text for the incoming Class of 2022.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The book selection was revealed through a Today@Brown email sent out March 16 as the culmination of a community-wide process that began in October. After receiving nominations from the Brown community at large, the First Readings committee met in December to narrow the list to around 15 books. Each committee member read four of those and then the final four books were selected: “Norwegian Wood,” “Ruined” and “The Lonely City: Adventures in the Art of Being Alone,” along with “Evicted.” “Evicted” was chosen after committee members read the finalists and received feedback from the University community, keeping in mind the need “to change the type of reading each year,” said Maud Mandel, dean of the college and head of the committee.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In making a selection, the committee looks for texts that offer an intellectually rich learning experience that encourages reflection and dialogue across Brown’s diverse incoming class,” said Aliosha Bielenberg ’20, a member of the First Readings committee.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Evicted” has a very “difficult question at its core,” First Readings committee member and professor of Africana and American studies Matthew Guterl said. In his interpretation, the text asks “What happens to incredibly poor people who exist in a very uneven American economy, and who are consistently displaced and removed, and what do we learn about our society from the collateral industries that pop up?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The book focuses on the town of Milwaukee, narrating the stories of families evicted from their homes. Yet, according to Mandel, the “powerful” aspect of the book is how the text allows readers to “look through the eyes” of not only those evicted, but also the landlords and the movers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Guterl emphasized not only the “readability and teachability” of the book, but also its ability to “speak to meaningful and contemporary issues.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Evicted,” “in particular, speaks to an American context right now, where income inequality and poverty are really pressing issues that students are very engaged with,” Mandel said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bielenberg, an advocate of “engaged scholarship,” appreciates that the book, written by a sociologist, does a “really good job of balancing that kind of academic perspective with maintaining a narrative that makes it very readable.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The goal of the First Reading(s) program is to introduce incoming Brown students to their first intellectual conversation on campus” Mandel said. She hopes that this “collective” experience helps the students set off on a common starting point, while exciting them about the kind of learning that will ensue, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Bielenberg recognizes that the book is quite limited geographically and demographically, he hopes that the conversation in the seminars extends beyond the book itself. He added that it is possible first-years will think about their personal experiences within the context of the text: “I hope that students think about what resonates with those experiences.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Guterl also hopes that the conversation is not just constricted to the kinds of “sociological tools” the author used, the “structure” of the book or the author’s “argument.” Rather, he feels the questions posed and the social problems addressed “have no easy solution” and “require a degree of citizenship and leadership on the part of the students and faculty.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b>Thousands rallied for gun control at the State House last Sunday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Three thousand Rhode Islanders bore posters, megaphones and palpable determination as they assembled to stand behind the survivors of the Parkland, Florida shooting and demand gun control March 24 at the State House. The rally, one of more than 800 “March for Our Lives” protests worldwide, featured speakers including Gov. Gina Raimondo, David Cicilline ’83, D-R.I., Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D-R.I., Mayor Jorge Elorza, State Rep. Aaron Regunberg ’12 D-Providence and student activists, The Herald previously <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/25/rallying-gun-control-thousands-gather-march-lives-state-house/">reported</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Rhode Island joined campaign against census question on citizenship Tuesday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhode Island has joined a multi-state lawsuit to “preserve a fair and accurate census,” announced Attorney General Peter Kilmartin <a href="http://www.ri.gov/press/view/32828">Tuesday</a>. The announcement comes in response to the federal government’s decision to include a question about citizenship on the 2020 Census — the first time since 1950 that respondents will have to indicate whether or not they are citizens of the United States. “It is critical for every person — regardless of their citizenship status — be counted in order to preserve the level of representation the State has in Washington, D.C.,” Kilmartin said, adding that the census’ purpose “is not to determine an individual’s citizenship status. In fact, asking the question will only serve to discourage individuals from responding.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Oldest tree kangaroo in the United States died at Roger Williams Park Zoo Tuesday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The kangaroo, “Paul,” lived for 23 years, five months and five days before passing away due to complications from heart issues that reduced his quality of life, Roger Williams Park Zoo &amp; Carousel Village announced <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RWPZoo/photos/a.385169421607.165014.279994236607/10155594545681608/?type=3&amp;theater">Wednesday</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His species, Matschie’s tree kangaroos, is native to Papua New Guinea and there are only about 2,500 to 3,000 left in the wild. The life expectancy for the species is less than 15 years, the zoo said. “It is a great testament to the love and care Paul received from his keepers and veterinary staff that he lived such a long life,” said Roger Williams Park Zoo executive director Jeremy Goodman in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Anti-vaccine advocates demanded a repeal of state’s vaccine mandates Wednesday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Opponents of Rhode Island’s mandatory vaccine policies showed up at the State House Wednesday in support of a legislative package that would allow parents to refuse vaccines for their children, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180328/battle-reignites-over-vaccinating-ri-school-children">reported</a>. Rhode Island currently requires a <a href="http://health.ri.gov/immunization/for/schools/">list</a> of vaccinations for pre-kindergarten and grade school children, but the proposed legislation would allow parents to opt out if the immunization is for “a non-causal contact disease transmitted by sexual contact between <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText18/HouseText18/H7576.pdf">individuals</a>” or for “personal, philosophical or religious <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText18/HouseText18/H7686.pdf">beliefs</a>.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Rhode Island school improvement plan approved Thursday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos approved Rhode Island’s school improvement plan Thursday, which increases state agency over academic standards, accountability and use of federal education funds, among other measures, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180330/us-secretary-of-education-approves-ri-school-improvement-plan">reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The improvement plan, approved under the Every Student Succeeds Act, includes an initiative to put computer science courses in every school in the state by 2025, personalized learning pathways and plans to involve teachers in statewide decision-making.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>After back-and-forth, WaterFire Arts Center displayed house honoring Rosa Parks Saturday, Sunday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University announced that it canceled the planned exhibition of a house that belonged to Rosa Parks’ brother over a “dispute” independent from the University March 8, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/15/rosa-parks-exhibition-canceled/">reported</a>. But the WaterFire Arts Center displayed the house March 31 and April 1. The future of the house is still unknown.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For the sixth consecutive year, the gymnastics team has qualified for the USA Gymnastics Collegiate National Championships. After finishing third at the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championship March 24, the Bears secured their spot among eight teams by posting a season-high 194.025 last weekend, and will travel to Texas Woman’s University in two weeks to vie for the national title.</p>
<p class="p2">“This has been our goal all year,” said Head Coach Sara Carver-Milne. “At the beginning of the year, it was looking a little rocky, and we weren’t putting together the best performances that we needed to solidify a spot for Nationals. But true to our team motto, Grit — greatness revealed in time —, we continued to stay on the right path, be patient and know that if we just continued to work and improve each week that we were going to qualify.”</p>
<p class="p2">Going into the conference championship, Brown was ranked sixth. After nailing season-best performances on vault and balance beam, the Bears finished ahead of host Penn, Cornell and first-ranked Temple University to prove they deserved a ticket to Texas.</p>
<p class="p2">“It was incredibly rewarding at ECACs because we knew we had to have a season high, and that can put a lot of pressure on the team,” Carver-Milne said. “But they actually took it more as an opportunity, embraced it and had a blast during the entire competition.”</p>
<p class="p2">Three competitors earned individual recognition. Cassidy Jung ’19 tied for third on beam to earn First Team All-ECAC recognition and Julia Green ’19 tied for fifth on vault to receive Second Team All-ECAC honors. Anya Barca-Hall ’18 was also recognized for academic achievements, getting named as an ECAC Scholar-Athlete of the Year.</p>
<p class="p2">To kick off the competition, Bruno took to the uneven bars where Caroline Warren ’21 set the stage with a 9.600 in the first routine of the meet. Erin Howell ’20 followed with a 9.625, and co-captain Claire Ryan ’18 built on their scores, posting a 9.675. Anya Olson ’18 led the team with a 9.700, and Kate Nelson ’21 capped off Brown’s first rotation with a 9.575.</p>
<p class="p2">A season-high 48.675 on beam midway through the meet put the Bears in prime position to record a strong team score. Ryan and Green posted matching marks of 9.675 at the top of the lineup while Rose Domonoske ’21 added a 9.725. Emma Hansen ’21 earned a season-best 9.775, and Jung tied her career-high of 9.825 to help Brown stay on pace with its competitors.</p>
<p class="p2">After two events, Bruno left the competition floor, using its third-rotation bye to refocus in the locker room.</p>
<p class="p2">“We started really strong on bars and beam, … so we were just holding on to that energy,” said co-captain Maggie McAvoy ’18. “We tried to stay relaxed and calm but also remember that we’re here to do a job.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears re-entered the meet on floor exercise where McAvoy kept the momentum alive with a 9.700. Olson posted a season-high 9.750 which Anne Christman ’20 matched in the middle of the lineup. Green performed a sky-high double back pike and double back tuck to tally Bruno’s top score of 9.800 while Barca-Hall capped off the event with a 9.675.</p>
<p class="p2">With one event left, Brown needed big scores on vault to ensure a place atop the podium. Nelson posted a 9.600 to give the Bears a solid foundation, and Gabrielle Hechtman ’19 followed with a 9.675. Performances by Christman and Green highlighted the final rotation as Christman stuck her tucked full-twisting vault perfectly for a personal-best 9.750, and Green nailed her front handspring front pike to tie her career-high 9.775. Alyssa Gardner ’21 earned a 9.700 for a full-twisting layout in the anchor spot, bringing up a season-high 48.500 on the event.</p>
<p class="p2">As their competitors rotated to their last events, the Bears returned to the locker room for their second bye and celebrated a successful performance.</p>
<p class="p2">“For us, it wasn’t really even nerves about Nationals or nerves about how we were going to place at the end of the day,” McAvoy said. “We competed like we needed to compete, so hopefully the cards were going to fall in place.”</p>
<p class="p2">The 194.025 helped Bruno qualify as the number seven seed heading into Nationals where Brown will compete against Yale, Cornell and Texas Woman’s University in the second preliminary session April 13 at 8 p.m. The top two teams for each session will advance to team finals April 14, and individual event finals will be held April 15.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: Rob Manfred crosses the Rubicon</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In consideration of all the harm he’s brought on my favorite sport, I’d say I’ve been pretty lenient with Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. I’ve acknowledged the positive things he’s done, and given him the benefit of the doubt when he’s made proposals that I’ve disagreed with. But 13 months ago, I drew a line in the sand when Manfred was reportedly considering testing a proposal in the minor leagues: Starting each extra inning with a runner on second base.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“No more benefit of the doubt, no more chances for redemption, no more let’s wait and see,” <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/09/schapiro-19-official-mlb-lost-mind/">I wrote</a>. “This is a stupid proposal, implemented by stupid people, for stupid reasons. None of this belongs anywhere near the national treasure that is Major League Baseball.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But last month, Minor League Baseball announced comprehensive rule changes for the 2018 season. Among them was the decision to place an automatic runner on second base during extra innings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this point, I don’t know if it’s worth it to reason against the decision. How can you explain that you shouldn’t just give out free runners? Manfred’s rule is not rational, and there’s not much that can be done about it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Where to begin? This rule is so clearly awful for so many reasons that it feels gratuitous to explain it. For one, the rule change doesn’t address an existing problem. Are there actually baseball fans out there who are happy to watch entire games, but get bored once extra innings begin? Making extra innings quicker is even less sensible than making the first nine innings quicker — and nobody wants that.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most of the baseball fans I’ve talked to, in fact, want the opposite: They love long, extra-inning games. If you’re a fan of the sport, how could you not? It’s extra baseball, where the most endearing quirks of the game are forced out into the open for fans’ delighted observation. Position players pitching? The last man on the bench winning it with a big hit? These are the best parts of baseball, not problems.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition, it will now be very easy to get a baserunner to third base with fewer than two outs. Winning a game in extra innings will come down to little more than the ability to hit a fly ball deep enough to bring home a runner from third. I can’t fathom how this is more exciting than starting off an inning with the bases empty, as innings have always started. There won’t even be any need for dramatic extra-inning home runs anymore: Who needs a homer when one single can end the game in a flash?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If this is not enough, there’s another problem with the rule. It seems that giving each team the same advantage in extra innings is the equivalent of not giving out an advantage at all. Both teams will get free runners on second base, and both teams’ chances of scoring will increase identically. Thus, every advantage one team gains from this rule will be canceled out by an equal and opposite advantage gained by the other. You might as well grant each team a certain number of free runs every inning. It wouldn’t have any real effect on games, but run production would skyrocket.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I struggle to understand how anyone could judge the rule as acceptable, but there’s more. There’s a deeper issue with this — it just isn’t baseball. I know other countries use this rule and that’s fine, but they have different baseball histories then we do. We’ve played this game the same way for well over a century. And to suddenly impose a rule that fundamentally changes the way an important aspect of our game works? And what’s more, to do it for no discernible reason? How can that be justified?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Manfred’s newest project is the worst of both worlds. It’s just like one of the rules above: It’s not part of baseball, and never should be. But it also has its own distinctly negative effects. It will make the game less exciting and more predictable and will artificially increase offensive numbers. And it will destroy the fun of extra innings — which many baseball fans love.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For some time now, Manfred has seemed determined to change the game of baseball as we know it. I’ve never quite taken him to task for it, but I am now. This proposal does not belong anywhere in the game of baseball. It should be abandoned, quickly forgotten and consigned to obscurity.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The days are getting longer, and nor’easters notwithstanding, they’ll start getting warmer too. Soon we’ll all be out on the Main Green, soaking in the sun between (or in spite of) assignment deadlines. But as students enjoy the rising temperatures, Brown Dining Services employees know that something else is looming on the horizon — another summer without air conditioning in the campus’ largest dining hall.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the summer, Brown opens its doors to Summer@Brown students who are eager to spend several weeks on campus. These students eat their meals at the Ratty, along with Summer@Brown residential advisors and undergraduates taking summer courses. The kitchens of the Ratty, located in the heart of the building, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/13/dining-services-gets-heat-lack-ac-ratty/">reach triple-digit temperatures during the summertime</a>. The full-time staff members who work in the Ratty are subjected to hot, humid and poorly ventilated conditions that cause dehydration and fainting. Worse still, staff numbers are scaled back during the summer. This means that employees are working harder and in worse conditions than they do during the academic year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dining Services employees have been asking for a solution to this problem for years. Air conditioning would make scorching kitchens bearable, allowing workers to make it through their shifts safely. This problem resurfaces year after year. There is still no air conditioning.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last summer, after students voiced their concern with this state of affairs, Brown agreed to rent cooling towers and place them in the kitchens of the Ratty. Cooling towers combine fans and cool mist to provide localized relief. The combined forces of cooling towers, additional breaks and extra water weren’t enough. The kitchens were still too hot<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— fans and mist just aren’t enough to cool a large scale commercial kitchen during the middle of summer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the summer came to an end, the cooling towers disappeared. There was no guarantee that they would be back in the summer of 2018. And so Dining Services employees have been placed in the same situation they’ve been in before — no way to stay cool in the kitchen during a sweltering summer. This problem requires a permanent solution: air conditioning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The administration may argue that because the Ratty is old, it would be difficult to install the infrastructure necessary to cool the kitchens. There is some truth to this argument — retrofitting an old building’s HVAC system is likely complicated. But that’s not an excuse. If the long-term solution is far away, then we need a better stopgap. Portable AC units are used in other University buildings without central air. There’s little reason not to extend the same rights to workers at the Ratty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dining Services employees work for students every day. When a snowstorm hits and the University is closed, the Ratty is not. Dining Services employees brave snowstorms so that students have a place to eat. When many students leave for holiday breaks, the Ratty stays open for those who remain on campus. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Here’s the thing — even if you’re off meal plan (like me) or spend all your credits at Jo’s and haven’t set foot in the Ratty since freshman year unit dinner, you should still care. Because the bottom line is this: Dining Services employees deserve to go to work in conditions that don’t make them faint. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s time for the student body to stick up for the people who literally put food on our tables. If you’re interested in getting involved with this issue, consider attending the Student Labor Alliance’s second community meeting, which will take place Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Smith-Buonanno Hall B 106.</span></p>

		<title>Fritschner &#039;06: Gun violence restraining orders are good</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The actions of America’s students over the past two months aren’t just inspiring — they are everything.</p>
<p class="p2">It is impossible to overstate the importance of local, coordinated action in this moment, and Brown’s students have stepped up. This level of grassroots engagement is what gun reform advocates have needed for many years to make advances on this issue.</p>
<p class="p2">Stopping gun violence is something I work on professionally. My career working in Congress began Dec. 14, 2012, the day of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which colored everything that came afterwards for me. Even as I became a press staffer, I asked for and received exactly one legislative issue. I write, therefore, as the gun violence policy advisor to one of the most active members of Congress on that issue — Congressman Don Beyer D-VA— though I am speaking solely for myself today.</p>
<p class="p2">I want to respond to the piece “Guns are not a mental health issue,” which ran in the Brown Daily Herald last week on gun violence and mental health, by Julia Rock ’19 and Jenna Israel ’21.</p>
<p class="p2">Rock and Israel are exactly right that we need better gun laws. They are right that banning weapons of war and strengthening background checks are key objectives of that effort. Rock and Israel are also right to say that bringing up mental illness is a dodge employed by the National Rifle Association and its allies to avoid meaningful conversations about gun violence prevention. I was treated for clinical depression as an undergraduate at Brown 13 years ago, and consider myself a member of the community which comes under attack whenever people wrongly stigmatize mental illness in the wake of a mass shooting.</p>
<p class="p2">Instead of continuing to tolerate these diversion tactics, it is essential that we consider real policy solutions. In particular, I want to make the case for a key reform which Gov. Gina Raimondo has sought for Rhode Island in the aftermath of the shooting in Parkland, Florida.</p>
<p class="p2">Gun violence restraining orders, also referred to as extreme risk protection orders in some states, are a mechanism by which law enforcement and families can restrict access to guns for people who present a demonstrated threat to themselves or others. They have been touted by experts as a means to prevent mass shootings, especially ones where there were numerous warning signs like those exhibited before the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.</p>
<p class="p2">The executive order which Raimondo issued in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting endeavored to enact some aspects of GVROs. Though Raimondo can only do so much by executive order, this is a good first step. But to realize the benefits of GVROs, Rhode Island needs the legal and judicial mechanisms which can only be created by the passage of a law in the state legislature. Raimondo called for such a law at the end of her order, and a bill has been introduced by several state representatives. Florida became the sixth state to enact such a law a few weeks ago, and similar measures are nearing passage in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p2">To return to the piece by Rock and Israel, I want to stress that the GVRO is a measure meant to reduce gun violence, not a mechanism to attack people of color or people with mental disorders.</p>
<p class="p2">As enacted in states like Connecticut, such orders may only be carried out after a judge issues a warrant on the basis of a sworn affidavit submitted by law enforcement or family members attesting to a specific, demonstrated threat of violence.</p>
<p class="p2">The fact that an order to remove guns is issued in response to a provable threat, and not merely to suspicions or the symptoms of mental illness, is key.</p>
<p class="p2">The mentally ill are many more times likely to be victims of gun violence than perpetrators, but most gun deaths in the United States are self-inflicted. Evidence shows that GVROs are crucial in protecting the severely mentally ill because they are particularly effective at preventing suicide by allowing families to remove access to guns from people in crisis.</p>
<p class="p2">Additionally, the fact that family members can seek GVROs helps to mitigate the threat that such measures might disproportionately impact people of color as a result of government action. And in fact, because people of color, particularly women, are at significantly elevated risks of being victims of gun violence, effective gun reforms like GVRO laws are valuable measures in protecting members of these communities.</p>
<p class="p2">GVROs are not a substitute for other gun reforms like the Assault Weapons Ban, introduced by fellow Brown alum Congressman David Cicilline ’83, D-R.I., who represents Providence in Congress, or laws requiring universal background checks; they are a complement to them. Cicilline is also a co-sponsor of the bill on which Beyer is a leader: the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act, which would help states adopt and implement GVRO laws. Sen. Jack Reed D-R.I. has pushed for a similar measure in the Senate.</p>
<p class="p2">Gun violence is a complex issue with many causes and no easy solution. There isn’t a single law that will prevent 30,000 deaths a year. But if an individual reform saves even one life it renders an immeasurable benefit. GVROs can save many lives, and several states have already begun the process of adopting these measures<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— most recently, in Florida and California.</p>
<p class="p2">GVROs are a good step forward, and Rhode Island should enact them.</p>

		<title>Study links brain processes involved in learning</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Reinforcement learning — a process during which humans alter their behavior as they learn which behaviors yield the best results — and working memory — which allows people to optimize decision-making by keeping track of previous actions and their consequences — appear to be two separate modes of human learning. But a recent study has demonstrated that the two processes cooperate to assist humans as they learn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anne Collins, assistant professor in the department of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley and former postdoctoral researcher at the University, and Michael Frank, professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences, co-authored the study.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“People used to view these two systems as independent of each other during the learning process,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frank said. “This study shows that reinforcement learning and working memory work together when they operate, rather than compete.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Participants in the study had to learn associations between symbols and corresponding buttons on a keyboard, according to a University press release. Researchers recorded brain activity during the learning process using EEG, which provided real-time data, Frank said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We varied the number of items shown on the screen,” ranging from “numbers less than the average capacity working memory and numbers more than the average capacity,” Frank said. There is a limited amount of items that can be held in working memory, and the duration of time which these items can be held is also finite. Taken together, when the number of symbols and the delay between the symbols increase, the working memory component in the learning process should shrink, according to the press release.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study revealed that brain signals associated with reinforcement learning were stronger when participants were given stimuli that overloaded working memory. But these signals were weaker when participants had to hold fewer items in working memory, Frank said. These findings suggest that the two systems are dependent on each other, because varying the inputs for working memory should not alter reinforcement learning signals if they were independent systems.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“While this study examines learning at a more basic science level of how discrete learning systems work in the brain, there are probably learning applications in the long run, but we are not at that stage yet,” Frank said. “However, understanding the biology of the two different systems can allow us to better predict how learning processes are affected among people with mental disorders and illnesses that affect these parts of the brain.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This is quite an important finding that advances our understanding of the learning and memory systems that drive adaptive behavior,” said Candace Raio, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Neural Science at New York University. “Knowing that these reinforcement learning and working memory systems work cooperatively constitutes a major step forward in understanding how we learn and adapt to environmental demands.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Skeptics who have yet to listen to the music of indie-rock princess “Soccer Mommy,” the alias of 20-year-old New York University dropout Sophie Allison, might scoff when told the tracks of the facetiously named artist are landing on the “chill” playlists of culturally astute stoner teens everywhere. More jaded listeners might label Allison’s brand as the natural extension of the ironically detached, self-aggrandizing bent that has become synonymous with alt-rock since Pavement. But there’s no predictable, masturbatory aesthetic to Allison or her music. Her anthemic, coming-of-age studio album “Clean” — released on March 2 —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>proves just that.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Clean” is Allison’s proper debut with Fat Possum Records, an independent label that previously released 2017’s “Collection,” Allison’s quite-literal collection of demos and re-worked songs from her self-produced E.P.s, posted to Bandcamp the summer before leaving for college. Jagged, vulnerable and self-aware, the tracks from “Clean” forcefully capture Allison’s longing for self-acceptance. “‘You gon’ be like that,’ is kind of the lesson of the album,” Allison told <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/29/soccer-mommy-clean-cool-scorpio-rising-interview-sophie-allison">The Fader</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On tracks like “Your Dog” and “Cool,” Allison channels ’90s punk-rock angst with a fresh perspective even while singing about frustration, desire and detachment. Throughout the album, Allison futilely pines after a fictive romantic ideal — embodied by the character Mary on the track “Cool.” Defined by a want to be wanted, Allison’s lyricism echoes the universal anxiety of singer-songwriters and situates herself in an illustrious tradition of fruitless longing expressed through song. The album’s edgier songs are offset by the misty, allegorical “Still Clean,” where Allison compares her ex-lover to an animal who picked her out of his teeth. The LP’s climax and crown jewel is “Scorpio Rising” — an apical track in which Allison reflects on nights spent with a boy who she knows is going to leave her for someone else. “And I’m just a victim of changing planets / My Scorpio rising and my parents,” she laments as the final verse crescendos in a sonic variegation that elevates the track beyond mere sentimentality. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it’s inevitable that Allison’s signature pout will wind up lending a provocative aesthetic to many a college dorm room, attempts to commercialize her persona do her an injustice. In the months before the release of “Clean,” The Fader profiled Allison under the headline “Soccer Mommy is 2018’s chillest new rock star” — despite the fact that there is nothing particularly “chill” about the existential tumult behind her lyrics. Though Allison lists young Taylor Swift and Avril Lavigne among her biggest influences, her music is far smarter than theirs. It nails Swift’s cathartic reliability without relying on tropism and lyrically outpaces the “Hey hey / you you” punk angst that Lavigne trademarked in the mid-2000s. Allison’s gift for poetry distinguishes her from rebellious girl-next-doors of yore. Allison’s astuteness, vulnerability and fleshy candor resound beyond the treacly song-writing of her influences while also transcending the self-satisfying obscura and affect of her alt-rock contemporaries. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Leah Vernon started her blog, “Beauty and the Muse,” in 2013 because every time she looked at a beauty magazine all she saw were tall and thin white women.</p>
<p class="p2">“I wanted to be that so bad,” Vernon told The Herald. “I (had) eating disorders and I hated my Muslimness and my blackness and my plus-size body because I couldn’t ever attain that look, … (that) societal way of seeing beauty.”</p>
<p class="p2">Vernon spoke Monday evening at the Providence Public Library about the power of positively expressing her identity as a woman of color who wears a hijab.</p>
<p class="p2">The conversation, moderated by the PPL’s Programs and Exhibitions Director Christina Bevilacqua, accompanied the library’s “HairBrained” series, a four-month-long exhibit that began in March. The exhibit and lineup of speakers feature items related to hairstyle from the library’s collections. According to Kate Wells, a PPL curator, the library hopes to explore the way that hair is treated politically to both oppress and empower individuals.</p>
<p class="p2">“The goal is to create a conversation of acceptance with how people choose to wear their hair, whether visibly or covered,” Wells said. “Hopefully, people gain awareness for why people might cover (their hair) and allow them to express themselves in different ways.”</p>
<p class="p2">In her talk, Vernon spoke about consciously attempting to subvert the superficial and false aura of perfection that many beauty bloggers project on social media. When she first began to blog in 2013, Vernon said she tried to mimic these more conventional bloggers, though she occasionally opened up about her life — her insecurities, frustrations and struggles with mental health.</p>
<p class="p2">Every time she did, she said her inbox quickly filled with messages fromwomen across the world who shared their stories and told her how inspiring it was to see these sensitive topics discussed publicly. At first reluctant to publish details about her private life online, Vernon said she eventually decided to embrace openness wholeheartedly because she felt people needed to hear her voice and see her for who she is. She became, in her own words, “the rawest of the raw” on the internet.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’m fat and I’m fabulous and I’m a sister and I’m educated and I want to put out that and not this perfect Instagram thing,” Vernon said.</p>
<p class="p2">While Vernon has been writing constantly since the age of six, she worried that no one on the New York Times bestseller list looked like her. Though she feared there would never be space for her in the writing world, she continued writing and went on to complete an MFA program at Wilkes University.</p>
<p class="p2">“Six years ago when we started working together she was definitely Leah, who she is, but was in a different place in her life,” said Taylor Polites, her former professor at Wilkes who now serves as a practitioner in residence at the Swearer Center. “Today, to think of all the building she’s done on her career and her platform, the audience that she has created for herself, it’s incredible for me to see her create that out of her own passion and determination.”</p>
<p class="p2">Vernon’s unapologetic rawness and fashion sense have earned her tens of thousands of followers across social media and widespread visibility. Recently, Lululemon Athletica offered her the chance to speak on a sponsored panel for International Women’s Day. Vernon told the library audience that she wavered at the thought of working with a company that seemed to cater to fit and light-skinned women.</p>
<p class="p2">“Lululemon doesn’t make clothes that fit me,” Vernon said. “But I wanted people to see my face there. Hopefully my presence being there and collaborating with them would help them to start using models who are larger and browner.”</p>
<p class="p2">Vernon closed out the evening answering questions from the audience about her tastes (she loves NPR) and the financial challenges she faces as a blogger, all the while continuing to emphasize her desire to transform beauty standards.</p>
<p class="p2">“I want to show people that beauty comes in all forms and to inspire people to be the best version of themselves,” Vernon told The Herald. “You don’t have to be what society tells you you have to be to feel valued or important or beautiful — I want people to feel like their voice and their body are worthy.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University studies postpartum depression program</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Postpartum depression, experienced by one in seven mothers in the United States, is more than twice as common among low-income women, according to a press release from Michigan State University. Researchers from Michigan State and the University are now studying how a program shown to help prevent postpartum depression might be implemented in clinics that “serve at-risk populations” across the country.</p>
<p class="p4">The program, called ROSE (Reach Out, stay Strong, Essentials for motions of newborns), was developed by Caron Zlotnick, a researcher at Care New England and research professor in the department of psychiatry and human behavior. Funded by the National Institutes of Health, the study aims to examine what would be required to sustain the program on a larger scale as part of “implementation research.”</p>
<p class="p4">The researchers are working with 90 clinics in six states to see how they can best adapt the program, said Jennifer Johnson MA’13, co-author of the study, adjunct associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior and professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at Michigan State.</p>
<p class="p4">Risk factors for postpartum depression include a history of depression, exposure to traumatic experiences and stressful life events, Johnson said. “For example: not having enough food to eat, not being able to get transportation, having conflict with your partner or not enough social support.”</p>
<p class="p4">Among financially disadvantaged women, strong social support has been found to limit negative stress reactions, Zlotnick wrote in an email to The Herald. “Empirical studies corroborate that greater social support is associated with lower depressed mood in perinatal financially disadvantaged women,” she wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">Studies suggest that women with fewer financial resources have both more stress and less familial support, which are both risk factors for developing postpartum depression, wrote Amy Salisbury, associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior, in an email to The Herald. There is a general consensus that treatment of a mother’s depression is the best way to mitigate and prevent its negative effects on their child’s development, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">ROSE “was developed because there were few interventions that demonstrated significant reduction in cases of postpartum depression and few, if any, studies (that) included women who were financially disadvantaged,” Zlotnick wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">The ROSE program consists of four in-person sessions, followed by a phone call after the baby has been born, Johnson said. It is an educational program, rather than a mental health treatment, that teaches women coping skills and helps them build a social support system.</p>
<p class="p4">In five clinical trials, groups that underwent the ROSE program saw fewer individuals experience postpartum depression than the groups that did not, Johnson said.</p>
<p class="p4">Prior to the research that is currently being conducted on the implementation of ROSE, the program had been studied in five clinical settings in Rhode Island, as well as in Mississippi and throughout prenatal clinics in Japan, Zlotnick wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">By bringing the ROSE program to 90 new clinics, the researchers hope to get a better understanding of what it will take to sustain the program on a larger scale. They plan to develop a sustainability plan and train clinics to implement the program and navigate operational logistics such as billing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by July, Johnson said.</p>
<p class="p4">“It doesn’t help to have effective interventions if they’re not used,” Johnson said, adding that it’s important to know what helps an intervention program like ROSE sustain long-term influence and continue to be implemented, especially in clinics which might not have many resources.</p>
<p class="p4">Salisbury wrote that she is “pleased to hear that the intervention has been successful in clinical trials and is being prepared for wide-range use in other locations. Prevention of depressive illness in pregnancy and postpartum should be the goal, to prevent any potential influences on development.”</p>
<p class="p4">Women considering pregnancy or who are already pregnant and have a history of depression should explore the resources available to them or consult with a perinatal mental health specialist to know what their options are, Salisbury added.</p>
<p class="p4">Johnson emphasized that postpartum depression is common, and support is available to those who experience it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Funded through the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/02/24/program-looks-boost-postdoc-diversity/">President’s Diversity Postdoctoral Fellowship Program</a>, the University’s Native American and Indigenous Studies Postdoctoral Fellowship is currently accepting applications. The fellowship, which enters its third year in July, is a two-year program awarded to one PhD student annually.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The purpose of this fellowship is to support emerging Native American and Indigenous studies scholars” while also allowing the University “to gain from having their expertise (on campus) in the very particular area that they’re working on,” said Elizabeth Hoover MA’03 PhD’10, professor of American studies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By participating in the program, the fellow will have the opportunity to teach two classes: an introductory course in Native American and Indigenous studies and another in their area of research. They will also host a panel or lecture series on a key topic in Native American and Indigenous studies during each of the two years of the program, said Robert Preucel, director of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology and professor of anthropology. The fellow will also receive a salary from the University set by the Dean of the Faculty, Preucel wrote in a follow-up email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University is looking for “people that are doing interesting work, that are engaging with some of the contemporary issues that are helping define Native American and Indigenous studies today,” Preucel said. Candidates for the fellowship can come from any university, he added. While the application process is rolling, faculty will begin reviewing submissions May 1. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Unlike previous years, the University now recommends that applicants contact Brown faculty members to find academic mentors that they would be interested in working with during the fellowship, Preucel said. Because this faculty member would likely specialize in the fellow’s field of study, the fellow can then be housed in the same department after arriving at Brown. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mariaelena Huambachano — who was awarded the postdoctoral fellowship in 2016 — wrote in an email to The Herald that the program “enabled me to achieve my goals about extending academic relationships (and) be an educator of an Indigenous epistemic opening of (inquiry), as well as develop an international community-based research project.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The fellowship is also part of the University’s Native American and Indigenous Studies initiative, which is an effort to create “an intellectual community of scholars who are contributing to Native American and Indigenous studies,” Preucel said. Though there is no department of Native American and Indigenous studies, the University initiative creates a working group of faculty and students between departments to study issues in the field. But Preucel said he hopes the University will add an official department in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University is currently seeking a director to oversee the NAIS initiative, Hoover said. Because candidates for the director position “have slightly different focuses to their research, to their own areas of expertise, … they each would take the program in a slightly different direction,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ultimately, through the fellowship and initiative, the University can “support indigenous studies scholars who are just starting out (and bring) in people who are doing interesting research that can then educate our students and faculty,” Hoover said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Letter: University needs to be more transparent about the Israel Fund</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Wintersession course UNIV 1001: “The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Contested Narratives” was offered in January 2017 to 12 students. It was presented as being funded by the Global Experiential Learning and Teaching grant, though in reality it was financed by a University initiative called the Israel Fund. As students who participated in this course, we were shocked when we found out that the course was funded by the Israel Fund, as stated in a recent University <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/01/israel-fund">press release</a>. The Israel Fund is a donor-driven endowed fund established in late 2016 to allow University students and community members to “learn about Israel and from Israelis,” according to the press release. It is framed as a “regional studies” and has already raised $3.8 million of its $10 million goal to become an endowed fund.</p>
<p class="p1">We are deeply concerned with the omission of financial information about the Wintersession course, the way the course is being used to support the Israel Fund and the University’s overall lack of transparency with the Fund.</p>
<p class="p1">First, every student was explicitly told in writing at least three times that the Wintersession course was funded by GELT. The GELT grant is an <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/global-engagement/grants/global-experiential-learning-and-teaching-gelt">initiative</a> from the Dean of the College that finances courses “that embed an international travel component prior to, during or at the end of the course and for destination courses during Brown’s Wintersession.” In reality, the Israel Fund sponsored this trip — while GELT administered it — without notifying the students before, during or after the trip.</p>
<p class="p1">Second, a Feb. 25 Herald article — published with a picture of the group of students taking UNIV 1001 — portrays our course as the balanced centerpiece of the Israel Fund. This is deeply troubling for various reasons. The article effectively turns us, quite literally, into the faces of the Israel Fund despite the fact that we were never told that the Fund had anything to do with our course or that it existed at all. We participated in the course under the impression that we would study using a balanced approach — balanced of an approach as possible within a dynamic of oppressor and oppressed. However, it is important to note that presenting Israeli and Palestinian accounts as competing, symmetrical narratives despite the unequal histories and realities of the “conflict” is incredibly careless and fails to recognize this dynamic. Nevertheless, the fact that the course was funded by, and is now being used as an advertisement for, the Israel Fund shatters any claims of a balanced political approach altogether. Had we had this knowledge beforehand, we would have chosen not to participate. Furthermore, we are also alarmed that The Herald article’s author consulted only one student representative from the class when, in reality, students who took the course hold a range of opinions about it.</p>
<p class="p1">Third, we are deeply troubled by the lack of transparency surrounding the Israel Fund in general. Primarily, we do not know who is in charge of the Israel Fund. Moreover, prior to the establishment of the Fund, the creators did not consult or inform Brown students or professors, including the Middle East Studies department — which studies Israel-Palestine. There is a clear lack of publicly available information and public accountability, and this is worrisome.</p>
<p class="p1">We, as students who participated in the course, strongly object to our class being used as an advert for the Israel Fund. We want to know: Why were we not informed of the source of funding when we participated in the course? Who is directing this fund? Who are the donors, and what are their political motives? Who are we to hold accountable? Since we have been unwittingly used to promote and advertise the Israel Fund, we demand full transparency and critical dialogue with regard to its origins, composition and motives.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In late 2016, the Israel Fund was established at Brown. An endowment created from alum donations, the Fund seeks to support new and existing programs and courses centered on Israel. As The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/25/alums-support-israel-fund-first-regional-endowed-fund/">previously reported</a>, the University has raised $3.8 million toward a $10 million goal for the Israel Fund’s endowment. Upon reaching the $10 million goal, the Fund will return $500,000 annually for a programming budget. In the face of accusations leveled against the Fund by Brown Students for Justice in Palestine that call out the inherent injustice of creating an academic fund for Israel-related programming, Interim Director of Judaic Studies David Jacobson told The Herald that the Fund’s intention is “purely academic, not political.”</p>
<p class="p1">But because the Israel Fund was created without any involvement or critical input from the Middle East Studies department’s faculty, it is nearly impossible for the Israel Fund to be apolitical. If Brown was hoping to foster an academic conversation about Israel through the Israel Fund, it started a conversation encumbered by the bias associated with the Fund’s sponsorship. When money is given to fund the study of a specific nation or national context, nothing is apolitical, even if there are some moderate steps taken to create nuance in the conversation. The Israel Fund is an expressly political initiative that implies the University’s support for Israel, owing to its top-down origins and its close links to Israeli business.</p>
<p class="p1">In an attempt to distance Brown’s Israel Fund from a politicized rhetoric, Jacobson’s statement that the Fund is “purely academic” unfortunately lacks substance, for two main reasons. The first way the Israel Fund departs from its purported academic aims is the nature of its inception. As Professor Beshara Doumani, director of the Middle East Studies program, told The Herald, “the Middle East Studies faculty have never been approached about this . . . It would be great if we had more information or were brought into the loop of what the thinking is and what the plans are.” The Middle East Studies faculty had not heard about the Israel Fund before the Jan. 30 <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/01/israel-fund">press release</a> that announced its establishment or the fact that the Fund had been in the works for over a year, he said. Since Israel is, in fact, located in the Middle East, the exclusion of the Middle East Studies faculty raises a red flag about the so-called “academic” intent of the Fund.</p>
<p class="p1">Further, in comparison to other academically oriented and regionally focused groups that exist on campus, the Israel Fund was created from the top-down with money from external donors. It seems ill-fitting for the Fund to flaunt academic roots and integrity when the ideas for the Fund were not generated within any scholarly framework of a department or program. Typically, if there is a genuine, grassroots demand for the creation of a scholarly program within the University, students and faculty will take the lead, organize on a grassroots level and work to transform their institutional objectives into reality. In the case of the Israel Fund, however, it seems that the wishes of wealthy alums have been uncritically mapped onto the University, without any apparent organic demand from students.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Israel Fund’s self-proclaimed “academic” origins are disingenuous, given that Brown is home to a broad range of grassroots, student-led and scholarly organizations and initiatives that are trying to get certain programs of study institutionalized. In fact, five years ago, Middle East Studies spearheaded the New Directions in Palestinian Studies Initiative. “New Directions” aims to shape scholarly works in the field of Palestinian studies through annual workshops at Brown and a book series that brings together emerging and established scholars. Brown Students for Justice in Palestine is another student-led group on campus that stands in solidarity with the Palestinian fight for equality and freedom, and supports the boycott, divestments and sanction movement. Additionally, consider the Southeast Asian Studies Initiative, an entirely student-led and student-driven project that seeks to enhance the visibility of Southeast Asia in the University’s academic offerings and faculty. Students involved in SEASI have had to advocate intently for the intellectual value of <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/26/students-push-southeast-asian-studies-development/">Southeast Asian studies</a>, developing their own independent studies. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Despite the Israel Fund’s efforts to support academic programs that, in the words of the Fund’s supporters, aim to “introduce students to the Palestinian experience,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>teach students “to see things through other peoples’ eyes,”and study — rather than reproduce — the “power imbalance” inherent in the narrative of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the secretive and exclusive origins of this Fund undermine its seemingly peaceful academic pursuits.</p>
<p class="p1">The second way the Israel Fund assumes elements of a political project — as opposed to a purely academic one — is its inclusion of not only academic programs, but also entrepreneurial enterprises. Last summer, the University launched the Israel Entrepreneurship Internship program. According to Executive Director of the Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship Danny Warshay ’87 P’20, students “not only got to experience what it’s like to work at a startup, … (but) they also got a cross-cultural experience to see what it was like to live in another international culture.” While Jacobson defends the Israel Fund as having solely a “academic” purpose, the Fund’s blatant business component proves this rhetoric is misleading.</p>
<p class="p1">By allocating a portion of the Fund’s capital to support Brown students immersed in tech startups, the Fund closely and undeniably aligns itself with Israeli politics. It is, after all, Israel’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/08/29/344030354/with-home-grown-technology-israel-becomes-leading-arms-exporter">technology and science sectors</a> that have led to the development of drones, armed bulldozers, border fences and surveillance equipment that are used to carry out violence against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-protest-clashes.html">Palestinians</a>. As a result, the internships funded by the Israel Fund will most likely reveal to students, through a “cross-cultural experience,” the single-story narrative of how developed, tech savvy and forward-looking Israeli society is. And, in the process, the University — which allowed for little community deliberation about the potential pitfalls of the Israel Fund —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>becomes complicit in the systems of racial and ethnic oppression synonymous with Israeli policies today.</p>
<p class="p1">Even if the Israel Fund’s academic programs have any redeeming qualities, the Fund’s internship component directly places the Fund within a political framework. It is important to remember that while region-specific programs and scholarly initiatives are integral to pursuing a holistic and liberal education, the methods by which some programs are implemented can, in fact, undermine their academic intentions. In terms of the Israel Fund, its top-down creation and internship component transform the Fund into a political tool. As Brown students, it is our job to remain continuously engaged in and constructively critical of the University’s academic endeavors. The Israel Fund is the perfect opportunity to unite as a community and speak out against an alum-driven and potentially dangerous political project masquerading as an academic program.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I read The Herald’s April 1 column “Schapiro ’19: Rob Manfred crosses the Rubicon”, and while I don’t love what Rob Manfred is doing to baseball, denouncing the implementation of an international tiebreaker in the minors is not the right battle to choose. There are plenty of problems to solve in baseball, and there are plenty of problems with the proposed solutions to those problems, but this is not the one to fight.</p>
<p class="p2">First, the idea that the rule doesn’t address a problem is wrong — it just doesn’t address the problem you think it does. Starters are throwing fewer and fewer innings, and after seeing the success of teams with strong bullpens, like the 2016 Cleveland Indians and 2017 Colorado Rockies, relievers are more expensive than ever. Keeping extra innings down isn’t about quickening nail biters — it’s about protecting teams from multimillion-dollar injuries. I love seeing Chris Davis take the win over Darnell McDonald as much as any other fan. It’s exciting, but it also puts overtaxed bullpens and the position players who relieve them at risk unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="p2">Second, if your argument is that old-school baseball is better than the changing modern game, international tiebreakers should make you giddy. It may not have the excitement of a game-winning home run, but with four-baggers already at a record high and climbing, do we realistically need more? Instead, what we get with international rules is the resurgence of small ball baseball, a dying art. Rosters full of power bats nowadays are often devoid of players who can lay down a good bunt and force the defense to make mistakes. That’s old-school baseball at its finest. The team that can execute the fundamentals of the game is the team that wins, and we should be rewarding that. In an era where hitter tendencies can be analyzed down to the minutiae, let’s force teams to squeeze in runs and let bullpens try to stop them. That’s just good baseball, and it’s disappearing.</p>
<p class="p2">Lastly, as much as I dislike a lot of what’s happening in baseball analytics, James Schapiro’s statement that “we’ve played this game the same way for well over a century” is laughable. Forty years ago, the five-man rotations we take for granted now were being questioned in the same way that today’s experimental six-man ones are. Defensive shifts were all but unheard of even 10 years ago, and now we see infielders move not only with every batter, but also with every pitch. Can you imagine today’s American League without the designated hitter? Baseball is steeped in tradition, but perhaps its most pervasive tradition is change. Fans never like it, but they always adapt.</p>
<p class="p2">It is clear that Manfred intends to be the commissioner to save baseball from itself. Pace of play has become a major priority in a way it never was in the past, and rules like visit limits demonstrate the ways our current commissioner is far removed from the actual action on the field. I don’t have Manfred’s playing information in front of me, but that rule tells me he has never spent time behind the dish. No catcher would green-light a restriction like that, and its implementation was detrimental to baseball. However, it has now become part of the multifaceted strategy that makes baseball great. This is the thinking man’s game, and the international tiebreaker is now simply another aspect of it.</p>
<p class="p2">There’s no way to know now if we will see pre-placed runners in the Majors soon, or ever. The rule may become one of those minor league quirks like the pitch clock that is regularly discussed but has so far stayed out of Major League Baseball. Either way, the idea that it somehow takes away from baseball is one I can’t agree with. In an age where we see over 6,000 home runs and double-digit Tommy John surgeries a year, maybe a little more small ball is exactly what we need.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">At yesterday’s faculty meeting, Russell Carey ’91 MA’06 confirmed plans that Shake Shack will move into the first floor of the building currently under construction at 249 Thayer St., which will also house the Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship. The Shake Shack will move into the building at some point in 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Continuing the update on construction on campus, Carey announced that the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/04/friedmans-donate-24-million-renovate-rename-wilson-hall/">renovation of Friedman Hall</a>, formerly known as Wilson Hall, will be completed by the end of the summer. “It will benefit more people than anything else we’re doing,” Carey said. The building will serve as a legacy of Dean of the College Maud Mandel, who envisioned the classroom set-up in the building though she will be <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/23/dean-of-college-to-serve-as-president-of-williams/">leaving</a> the University before she can teach in the newly renovated space, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Stephen Porder, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, also announced the University’s goal to shift toward renewable energy, aiming for net zero carbon emissions by a soon-to-be-determined date. Currently, electricity and heating are the biggest contributors to the University’s emissions. President Christina Paxson P’19 hopes to “have a serious discussion about making a commitment for net zero” and establishing a deadline for this goal at some point in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “The most systematic threat to humankind remains climate change,” Porder said at the meeting, citing United Nations Secretary General António Guterres. To reduce the University’s emissions, the University plans to shift toward renewable energy by using wind or solar energy. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Provost Richard Locke P’18 discussed the University’s plans to enhance support for lowest income students, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/20/university-discusses-increasing-aid-highest-need-students/">previously reported</a>. The proposed plan includes changes to food and textbook aid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Paxson then took the podium to announce the results of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges report.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the end of the meeting, faculty members voted to go into executive session, excluding The Herald from the room. The meeting’s agenda states that they planned to have a round table discussion about Title IX. Specifically, faculty planned to discuss whether or not the University should inquire about whether prospective faculty members have been found responsible for Title IX or academic code violations at previous institutions. The faculty also planned to discuss if the University should, at the point of hiring, conduct criminal background checks on prospective faculty.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University hires new assistant VP for campus life</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Last month, Nicole Truesdell began her tenure as the new assistant vice president for campus life. In this role, Truesdell will provide “leadership and strategic planning for the division of campus life” in addition to implementing initiatives that ensure “the division and (the) University are attune to and responsive to the diversity of Brown’s student population,” Eric Estes, vice president for campus life, wrote in an e-mail to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">As assistant vice president, Truesdell will oversee the seven student centers on campus, including the Brown Center for Students of Color, the Sarah Doyle Women’s Center, the First-Generation College and Low-Income Student Center, the LGBTQ Center and the Stephen Robert ’62 Student Center. Truesdell said she wants the “different centers that operate under (her) profile” to approach their work “as a cohesive unit … (and) about how we name ourselves as a group.”</p>
<p class="p4">Truesdell also said she hopes to reconfigure the University’s interactions with students from minority backgrounds by not only catering to their needs but also understanding the strengths that they bring to campus. “Students from diverse backgrounds shouldn’t be seen as a deficit, but as an asset to the University,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">Led by a committee consisting of students, faculty and staff, the University began its search for the new assistant vice president for campus life last semester, Estes wrote. Truesdell “emerged as the strongest candidate in a national search that produced a very talented and experienced applicant pool,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">AJ Clifforde Alcover ’20, a member of the search committee, said the committee looked for candidates who could oversee and coordinate multiple programs and organizations. The committee felt Truesdell’s goals “really stood out and were the most innovative and complementary to what Brown needed,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">“Her energy was very pleasant. … Students would like to get to know (Truesdell),” Alcover said.</p>
<p class="p4">Prior to Brown, Truesdell worked at Beloit College, a liberal arts school in Wisconsin, where she founded the college’s Office of Academic Diversity and Inclusiveness in 2015. The office aids underserved and underrepresented students by “reforming institutional structures and practices (at Beloit College) to position underrepresented bodies and their assets (lived experiences, skills and mindsets) at the center,” wrote Atiera Coleman, interim director of the office, in an e-mail to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">During Truesdell’s tenure as the office’s director, she “helped many of us reimagine equity and inclusion while challenging us to dismantle the structural barriers that work against the success of marginalized students,” Coleman wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">Over the course of the next month, Truesdell said she will conduct intensive research and hold meetings with undergraduate and graduate students, as well as key administrative and academic actors on campus. “Campus Life thinks holistically about the curricular and co-curricular pieces that make up the whole Brown student experience,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“I’m excited to do the work and figure out how to merge the academic aspect with the campus life aspect at Brown,” Truesdell said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Ivy Film Festival 2018</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">The Ivy Film Festival, one of the nation’s largest student-organized annual film festivals, will launch its 17th installment Monday. The keynote event will take place April 9 in Salomon 101 from 6 to 8 p.m. and will consist of a screening of “#TAKEMEANYWHERE” and an accompanying address by creators Shia LaBeouf, Nastja Säde Rönkkö and Luke Turner. The festival’s week-long programming also includes the Aegean Film Festival Short Program April 10 and advanced screenings of “RBG” April 11, “On Chesil Beach” April 12, “We the Animals” April 13, “Blindspotting” April 14 and “Eighth Grade” April 15 with accompanying talks by director Betsy West, director Dominic Cooke, author Justin Torres and actor Daveed Diggs ’04, respectively.</p>
<p class="p2">Additional scheduled programming includes a virtual reality arcade, a production workshop with producer Tom Gormican and an official selection by IFF of the 25 best undergraduate and graduate student films.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Writers on Writing: Simone White</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Join award-winning poet Simone White Thursday in McCormack Family Theater at 5:30 p.m. as she reads from her oeuvre as part of the Writers on Writing Reading Series. White is the author of “Dear Angel of Death,” “Of Being Dispersed,” “House Envy of All the World” and the chapbooks “Dolly” and “Unrest.” She received the Whiting Award for poetry and was selected as a New American Poet for the Poetry Society of America.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Sock and Buskin’s “Sometimes the Rain, Sometimes the Sea” </b></span></p>
<p class="p2">“Sometimes the Rain, Sometimes the Sea,” the latest production by Sock and Buskin, will premiere Thursday at 8 p.m. in Leeds Theatre. An experimental interpretation of a seminal fairy tale, the play marks a partial adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Little Mermaid.” Written by Julia Izumi MFA’19 and directed by Kate Bergstrom MFA’18, the show will run through April 15. Tickets are $7 for students, $12 for seniors and $15 for adults.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Weatherproof: Arts, Humanities, and Sciences Explore the Environment</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Over the course of April, five programs at Brown are partnering to host a cross-discipline series that aims to explore pressing environmental issues. Each program approaches the theme in its own way, but the two common threads spanning the series are water and the impact of environmental change on polar regions. The David Winston Bell Gallery is hosting a public art exhibition titled “33°”; the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society’s “Water’s Edge” will feature a seminar, speaker series and poetry reading; the John Carter Brown Library will host an exhibit, sound installation and panel discussion entitled “Fluidity: Knowing Water in the Americas”; the Brown Arts Initiative’s symposium “Polar Opposites: Creative Intervention in the Arctic and Antarctica” will connect artists and scientists; and the Cogut Institute for the Humanities will host the two-day conference “Earth(ly) Matters: New Directions in Environmental Humanities.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Stipend cushions student transition costs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Graduate School will offer a new $1,200 transitional stipend for incoming doctoral students this fall, said Ethan Bernstein, director of administration and operations at the Graduate School. The stipend aims to help offset moving costs and will cost the Graduate School over $350,000 for around 320 doctoral students, Bernstein added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Doctoral students typically receive their first monthly stipend payments Sept. 30, said Alastair Tulloch GS, president of the Graduate Student Council. However, many students move to Providence in August, which means they need to bring money for a month of expenses, cutting into their savings, said D’Ondre Swails GS, a member of the Diversity Advisory Board.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“For myself, I started at Brown coming straight out of undergrad, so it wasn’t like I was in a situation where I could have been saving,” Swails said. “I arrived on campus with what I had from working all summer.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Graduate students were struggling to survive for the month or month and a half of moving to Providence,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Grad School expects the transitional stipend to help with more than just moving costs. “We have also seen an increase … in students coming to see our associate dean of student support for various other hardships,” Bernstein said. Students come to discuss mental health challenges, food insecurity or how to budget properly, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Another problem for students moving to Providence is the housing market, Swails said. “A sizable portion (of the housing market) requires the first month’s rent, last month’s rent and a security deposit that equals one month’s rent, so you’re looking at three month’s worth of rent to move into your apartment and, on top of that, living expenses,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The GSC welcomes the new transitional stipend and appreciates the University’s responsiveness to its concerns, Tulloch said. “We were pleasantly surprised when the University offered this transitional stipend,” Tulloch added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Concerns about transitioning to the University were raised during the GSC’s general body meetings last fall, he added. After those meetings, the GSC discussed possible solutions with Provost Richard Locke P’18, President Christina Paxson P’19 and Dean of the Graduate School Andrew Campbell.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to the GSC, other student groups, such as the Samuel M. Nabrit Black Graduate Student Association, have advocated for greater support for students transitioning to campus, Bernstein said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“(We used) the role of the advisory board to bring attention to the needs of graduate students, especially when we arrive at Brown,” Swails said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The transitional stipend is part of the ongoing effort by the Grad School to increase financial support for doctoral students, Bernstein said. The base stipend for doctoral students has risen 56 percent overall in the past 13 years, and dental insurance and parental relief have been added in the past few years, according to the Grad School <a href="http://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/about/initiatives-doctoral-education-and-student-support">website</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I suspect we will start to see more and more universities doing this,” Bernstein said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded the Leadership Alliance a $1.25 million grant that will fund summer research opportunities in the humanities and social sciences “for underrepresented students,” according to a University press release.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Leadership Alliance was founded at the University in 1992 and is still based on campus. The organization has expanded into a consortium of 36 academic institutions in order to help fulfill its mission of “develop(ing) underrepresented students into outstanding leaders and role models in academia, business and the public sector” through mentorship, conferences and networking opportunities, among other initiatives, according to the Leadership Alliance website.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Mellon Foundation grant will fund summer research opportunities for 55 undergraduate students for each of the next five summers, said Medeva Ghee, executive director of the Leadership Alliance and assistant professor of the practice of behavioral and social sciences.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Students from across the country will be paired with a professor for research in areas such as anthropology, history or philosophy, and they will spend their summers researching at one of ten participating universities, including Brown, New York University, Stanford University, Harvard or Yale, according to the program’s website.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Summer research opportunities in the humanities and social sciences are few and far between, and we are one of the few (organizations) that provide research (opportunities) in those disciplines for undergraduates,” Ghee said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“One of our main goals for our program is to give students a community,” said Barbara Kahn, coordinator for graduate and undergraduate programs at the Leadership Alliance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even if they are placed at different universities, “the students who are part of this Mellon group have a conversation together online guided by a graduate student, ... so that they have a sense that they’re not isolated,” Kahn said. The program’s participants on the east coast also gather twice during the summer, Kahn said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Leadership Alliance and the Mellon Foundation have collaborated in the past. “We cultivated a relationship with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and so the funding from the Mellon Foundation actually started in 2009,” Ghee said. “This is a continuation of that funding that has allowed us to expand opportunities.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Foundation aims to bolster “the contributions of the humanities and the arts to human flourishing and to the well-being of diverse and democratic societies” by supporting “exemplary institutions of higher education and culture,” according to the Foundation’s website.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s exciting that Brown University has taken the lead (in its) partnership with other research institutions and minority-serving institutions to address the underrepresentation of students in graduate training programs, the professoriate and in all career sectors,” Ghee said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>C.J. Chivers explores limits of journalism</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">C.J. Chivers has been on the front lines, both as a writer and a soldier. The New York Times reporter spoke about his experiences as a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps in a writing workshop and speech Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chivers began the talk by heavily critiquing three videos of war coverage, two of which were his own journalistic work. Referring to journalism as a “first draft of history,” Chivers said there is inherent weakness in war coverage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Playing a video that showed an exchange of gunfire between Taliban and U.S. forces in Afghanistan on Valentine’s Day in 2010, Chivers said the coverage showed some of the confusion and frustration of battle. “Now I’m gonna say something: As the person who shot that footage and helped edit it … and voiced it, that report is wholly insufficient.” Questions of what happened to the soldiers and the civilians went unanswered, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the other videos were “a lot better than no report at all,” they similarly left information out of their reports. The coverage didn’t show the experiences of women or of non-violent resistance. “War isn’t exclusively experienced by men,” he said, even if most of the organizers of war are men.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This is not a celebration of journalism,” Chivers said. “Everything that you are consuming about war is not enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chivers decided to join the Marines after the attack of a Marine base in Beirut in October 1983. He said he saw Marines on the cover of Newsweek and identified with them more than with his classmates in school. Even though he was skeptical of U.S. military capabilities and the Vietnam War, he signed up to become a Marine officer. He left active duty in the military in 1994 and immediately went to the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. He then started working at the Providence Journal, covering North Providence, the Providence Police Department and former Mayor Buddy Cianci. Covering Cianci in Providence was like covering Penguin in Gotham, Chivers added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After the Twin Towers were attacked Sept. 11, Chivers, who was working at the New York Times, was sent to Afghanistan to cover the war. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before his talk, a smaller group of students from Brown and the Naval Academy Preparatory School sat down earlier with Chivers to discuss the “civilian-military divide” and the role journalism plays in it. The workshop quickly turned into a conversation about the perception of the military and what it means to serve. Reflecting on Chivers’ own time serving, many NAPS students described their search for meaning in their work and a lack of clarity about what their futures hold.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mary Lewallen, a NAPS cadet who is formally enlisted and originally from Alabama, said she was glad to get a chance to interact with civilians.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chivers’ talks were funded by a National Endowment for Humanities grant, according to Jane Gerhard PhD’96, who works on public programming for the project “Irregular Warfare: Experiences Across the Civil-Military Divide.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The grant is designed to use the humanities to bridge the divide between civilian and military people,” Gerhard said, adding that the United States is seeing the largest number of former military personnel attending universities since World War II. Half of the grant money helps integrate student veterans into higher education in six different R.I. schools. Gerhard said that three student veterans at Brown participate in the NEH-funded program. The other half of the money is used to create community conversation between the veterans and civilian groups — such as the one Chivers’ workshop aimed to cultivate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ava Rosenbaum ’20 said she went to the workshop because she was interested in journalism but was glad she went because “the conversation didn’t revolve around that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I got to hear perspectives from people I don’t get to interact with on a day-to-day basis,” Rosenbaum said, adding that it was “hugely rewarding and eye-opening.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A student from the University of Rhode Island in the audience asked Chivers what advice he had for someone hoping to become a war correspondent — “War reporting? Don’t do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s really bad for you, and it’s not going to make a difference. … You’re probably going to get hurt,” he added, explaining that many war journalists develop drug and alcohol dependencies and experience failed marriages. Pointing to his children in the back row, he said he was gone for years at a time covering different conflicts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m not gonna pretend to be fine, you should try to see me sleep,” Chivers said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I know very little of what I did mattered because bureaucracy dragged on,” he said. “But I’ve accepted it, I’m working on the margins, just trying to do my description accurately.” Despite his reservation about journalism’s ability to create systemic change, he says he still believes in the field.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The human connection that comes with this job can be incredibly potent and valuable,” Chivers said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Annenberg staff, programs depart after University review</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The Annenberg Institute for School Reform’s website used to feature a tab on the front page called “What We Do.” That page, along with many of the institute’s staff members, is no longer a part of the University.</p>
<p class="p4">Following a review of the institute conducted from fall 2016 to fall 2017, the University moved all of the institute’s programs to other universities in order to shift the institute’s mission away from community-based work on school reform and toward the study of education inequality. Many of the more than 20 former institute employees have expressed their concerns that the shift damages the institute’s legacy of community-focused work and diminishes its power to effect change.</p>
<p class="p4">Some of the institute’s former staff members worry that the new mission may tarnish the institute’s progressive reputation and make its work less unique. Under Warren Simmons, the institute’s executive director from 1998 to 2015, the institute’s strength was that it “married research and practice in a way that very few institutes had been doing,” said Angela Romans, former co-director of district and systems transformation at the institute. “Brown is changing all of that to have the Annenberg Institute become one of thousands of education research think tanks that are housed in universities. … It’s incredibly short-sighted, and it’s also counter to the way that the field is moving,” she added.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>A legacy of progressive change </b></p>
<p class="p4">The institute was established in 1993 and first directed by Theodore Sizer, who was known as “one of the country’s most prominent education-reform advocates,” according to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/education/23sizer.html">obituary</a> in the New York Times.</p>
<p class="p4">Simmons expanded the institute’s mission to address reform of the entire educational system, keeping “racial equality and social justice in the forefront of the mission in a central way,” Romans said. Simmons stepped down in December 2015, and Michael Grady was named interim executive director in his absence. Almost two years after Simmons’ departure, the University selected Susanna Loeb to replace him, The Herald <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/education/23sizer.html">previously reported</a>. She will begin as director July 1.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>A shift away from community-based work </b></p>
<p class="p4">In fall 2016, President Christina Paxson P’19 appointed Provost Richard Locke P’18 to review “the institute’s mission, strengths and opportunities for the future” in an effort to align its work more closely with <a href="http://www.brown.edu/web/documents/BuildingOnDistinctionOct262013.pdf">Building on Distinction</a>, the University’s strategic plan, according to the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/web/documents/provost/Annenberg_Institute_Report_Executive_Summary.pdf">executive summary</a> of the review.</p>
<p class="p4">The review committee included faculty members from different disciplines, senior University administrators and Annenberg Institute staff. Chair of the education department Kenneth Wong, a faculty member who served on the review committee, declined to comment. Tricia Rose, professor of Africana studies, director of the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America and a member of the review committee; David Kirkland, executive director of the New York University Metropolitan Center; and Zakiyah Ensari, advocacy director for the Alliance for Quality Education in New York, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="p4">Paxson asked this committee to determine how to make the institute “more integrated with the rest of the University,” Locke said.</p>
<p class="p4">The committee watched presentations about the institute’s various research projects and evaluated and compared them to education policy programs at peer institutions. At the end of the process, the committee proposed pivoting the focus of the institute toward studying educational inequality and away from work on school reform.</p>
<p class="p4">For example, the committee recommended that all of the institute’s programs move to other universities. Those programs worked to help community groups advocate for themselves to reform their schools. “We think that’s really important work, but (at) a university like Brown, that’s not one of our core competencies to do capacity building for communities. What we do is research and teaching, and it’s through our research and teaching that we have an impact (on) the world,” Locke said.</p>
<p class="p4">The New England-Based Community Organizing and Engagement and the District and Systems Transformation programs — now combined into one initiative called the Center for Youth and Community Leadership in Education — have moved to Roger Williams University under the leadership of Keith Catone, former associate director of community organizing and engagement at the Annenberg Institute.</p>
<p class="p4">Additionally, the Research and Policy program and the New York-based Community Organizing and Engagement program have moved to the NYU Metro Center. This program aims to support the improvement of education in urban areas through policy research and training, among other efforts, according to its <a href="http://www.annenberginstitute.org/what-we-do/areas-practice/community-organizing-engagement">website</a>. For example, its Pittsburgh Parent Power project trains school staff and leaders to effect change in their communities. Another project, the New York City Education Organizing Capacity Building, educates parents and student groups to advocate for school reform.</p>
<p class="p4">There was a “mismatch between the work that (was) being done and what the University is all about,” which “is why there were very few ties between Annenberg and the rest of the University, and that just seemed like a lost opportunity,” Locke said.</p>
<p class="p4">The committee recommended this shift in order to address a disconnect between the institute’s work and the University’s focus on research and teaching, Locke said.</p>
<p class="p4">The new focus on studying education inequality will allow the institute to increase integration with some of the University’s academic departments, such as economics, sociology, political science and Africana studies, Locke said.</p>
<p class="p4">The pivot will allow the institute to ask: “What are the causes, what are the consequences, and what are the possible solutions to mitigate educational inequality?” Locke said. “We know that having access to high quality education is one of those things that will determine one’s life chances and choices in this country. And in this country, access to high quality education is very unequal,” he added.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>A rocky transition</b></p>
<p class="p4">Paxson and Locke said that the 2016-17 review process began following Simmons’ retirement in December 2015, according to both Locke and a faculty-wide email written by Paxson and reviewed by The Herald. However, Simmons stepped down as executive director because Paxson and Locke were interested in changing the institute’s mission, Simmons said.</p>
<p class="p4">“The review started last year, and that was because of a transition that happened at Annenberg. The previous director retired, and there was a search for a new director,” Locke said.</p>
<p class="p4">“It was clear to me” that the president and provost were focused on moving toward research and teaching, and “that wasn’t a good fit or match for me,” Simmons said. He stepped down to “pursue other opportunities” and is now working as the senior policy advisor at the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder.</p>
<p class="p4">The review committee aimed for “a fair, transparent process of transition,” Locke said. In December 2016, the committee announced its plans to shift the mission of the institute by December 2017, giving staff members a year to prepare for the shift. The University also paid the salaries of staff members for six months after their departure, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">While Locke views the institute’s long transition process as an advantage that provided Annenberg staff members time to plan their next move, Rosann Tung, former director of research and policy, argued that the extended length of time was one of the transition’s biggest problems. “We knew two and a half to three years before that the University was redirecting or shifting the mission without knowing whether any current employee would be welcomed to stay on, which resulted in a period of great uncertainty and reduced morale,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Tung was one of two Annenberg staff members who served on the review committee. “While the transition committee members listened to (Annenberg Institute) perspectives on community engagement and its strengths in terms of research, policy and practice that supports districts and communities, the resulting roadmap left those assets out,” Tung said.</p>
<p class="p4">Grady, the other Annenberg staff member who served on the committee, felt the institute’s “voices were heard,” he wrote in an email to The Herald. But he added that “it was difficult for the staff to accept that our work, about which they cared deeply, would move away from Brown.”</p>
<p class="p4">Within the review process, “it never felt like there was any authentic or genuine opportunity for staff to have any meaningful role in the decision-making,” Catone said.</p>
<p class="p4">“The most confounding thing for us was this notion that the kind of work we were doing just didn’t belong at Brown. … There was no opportunity to actually have a conversation about how the vision set forth in this roadmap might actually be able to coexist with the work that existed,” Catone added. “For those two and a half years, they certainly had the time to explore it, but there was never any interest on the part of the president’s and the provost’s offices.”</p>
<p class="p4">“It would have been nice to get a thank you, to get some acknowledgement of the work we’ve done,” said Richard Gray, former director of community organizing and engagement. Gray is currently continuing his work at the NYU Metro Center.</p>
<p class="p4">But “I would contest the claim that there wasn’t an opportunity to present (staff members’) views or even that we didn’t value their work,” Locke said.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Concerns for the future, but moving on to a new Annenberg</b></p>
<p class="p4">Several former staff members expressed uncertainty and concern about recent changes at the institute.</p>
<p class="p4">For example, the institute’s leadership used to be made up of primarily people of color, making it distinct from most academic departments, Catone said.</p>
<p class="p4">In shifting the institute’s mission, the University “lost a highly productive group of leaders and researchers of color committed to support and action in communities most historically marginalized,” Tung said.</p>
<p class="p4">“The kind of institute that the Annenberg Institute will become is … fairly typical,” Simmons said. “Obviously, I think it’s a great loss for the field. … The value of the institute’s previous two to three decades of work can be seen in the fact that most of my colleagues have found homes in other universities that have welcomed them with open arms,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Romans finds it reassuring that the work continues at other institutions. She is currently the senior vice president of programming for Say Yes to Education, a nonprofit organization that works to help ensure children have the opportunity to attend college.</p>
<p class="p4">On July 1, Loeb will begin her role as the new director of the institute. “I believe that in Susanna Loeb, the search committee found an outstanding scholar who will strengthen Annenberg’s relationship with other academic units at Brown,” Grady wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">“I don’t see field-based and research-based as opposites of each other,” Loeb said. Loeb and the former directors of the institute have similar goals, she said. “We’re just taking the perspective that we can actually reach those goals better if we bring in the whole Brown community and focus a little bit more on improving our knowledge and making sure it impacts broadly.”</p>
<p class="p4">Loeb hopes to get faculty and students more involved with the institute so that it becomes a “part of the Brown world,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">“I have the opportunity to help create a culture. Starting new is actually sometimes easier than coming in when the goals … and routines have already been set. I’m really excited about the opportunity.”</p>
<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that President Christina Paxson P'19 appointed Provost Richard Locke P'18 to review the Annenberg Institute's "mission, strengths and opportunities for the future" in December 2015.

		<title>Johnson &#039;20: Don’t romanticize destructive habits</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the American College Health Association, nearly one out of five university students is affected by anxiety or depression. There are many reasons why these disorders may be <a href="https://theconversation.com/1-in-5-college-students-have-anxiety-or-depression-heres-why-90440">prevalent</a> on college campuses, including smartphone addiction, the rising cost of college and mental overexhaustion. Nearly all students at Brown experience some form of mental overexhaustion at least once during their time here. Often, balancing a rigorous course load, extracurriculars and a social life can lead to burnout; however, it’s important to note that romanticizing a stressful and busy lifestyle can lead to further exhaustion. This obsession with having a busy life can negatively affect not only the school culture but also students’ mental health. Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence at Brown; in 2012, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-buzz/post/georgetown-johns-hopkins-make-newsweeks-list-of-most-stressful-colleges/2012/08/30/8a257a4e-f2a2-11e1-a612-3cfc842a6d89_blog.html?utm_term=.fff8ad13bf45">Newsweek</a> ranked Brown as the sixth most stressful school in America.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Around midterm season, it’s not uncommon to overhear conversations that revolve around people one-upping each other when it comes to who is “the most” overwhelmed. If one person says that they have two exams that week, someone else will respond that they have two exams that day. While it may seem unusual for people to be competitive about overexhaustion, it can be thought of as a result of our success-driven society. According to a Harvard <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/alesina/files/work_and_leisure_in_the_u.s._and_europe.pdf">study</a>, Americans work 50 percent more hours than Europeans. The study suggests that Americans do this because of our cultural notion that hard work equals success. Our society focuses on input rather than output. It is the reason why many are willing to pull all-nighters and run on nothing but caffeine on a daily basis in order to be successful. In addition to this, many college students tend to romanticize academic stress since it is easier to talk about than social stress. Many people usually experience their social difficulties privately, making them feel further alienated, but a sense of companionship tends to be <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2017/10/work-stress.html">established</a> when students discuss academic-related stress with each other as a bonding mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sometimes, it may be impossible for someone to avoid pulling an all-nighter, especially during a busy time in the semester. And it can be nice to rant to other students about the stress we feel. However, the obsession with a busy and stressed lifestyle can have a detrimental impact on individuals and on the college campus as a whole. For individual students, numerous <a href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-sleep-disorder#1">studies</a> have shown that over time, low sleep levels contribute to higher rates of anxiety, depression, poor academic performance and obesity. In addition to this, someone with work addiction may begin to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/addiction/work#symptoms">engage</a> in compulsive work in order to avoid addressing other problems in their life, like personal crises or troubling emotional issues. And in terms of affecting the college campus overall, commonly discussing who has the most work or the least sleep can promote poor mental health and encourage destructive behaviors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While there is value in hard work, it also important to not romanticize overexhaustion in order to ensure that students’ mental health is not being compromised. There are ways that students can make sure they achieve a balanced, healthy work ethic and lifestyle. For one, many people become addicted to stress once they move from “I feel stressed” to “I am stressed.” When people strongly identify with an emotion, it can become their <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/08/how-to-use-stress-to-your-advantage">definition</a> of self. It’s important to remember that stress is not a reality; it is a bodily response to a feeling about a situation in the moment. By letting go of that attachment to the feeling, you can gain more perspective and be able to move forward from that emotion. It may be also helpful to step back and think about why you romanticize stress. If it’s because you are motivated by stress and the feeling of accomplishing things, use this to your advantage when completing work, but set healthy boundaries like going to bed at a decent hour in order to make sure your mental health is not at stake. If this obsession comes as a way to avoid personal issues, you may want to consider scheduling a session with Counseling and Psychological Services. Regardless of the reason, it’s important for us all to rethink our relationships with stress and take steps to establish healthy habits that will positively impact our mental health.</span></p>

		<title>Simshauser &#039;20: Rethinking Democrats’ strategy for 2020</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following the 2016 presidential election — as the initial shock of President Trump’s victory began to wane — liberals looked to exit polling data, attempting to diagnose the exact factors that had felled Hillary Clinton’s ostensibly sturdy “blue wall.” Almost immediately, the narrative began to center on the white working-class voter, the demographic Trump had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html">overwhelmingly carried</a> by a margin of ​67 to 28 percent​. This aligned with anecdotal evidence, and emphasized the image of the disaffected white voter, who had been alienated by the stereotypical “coastal liberal elite.” News coverage — already prone to over-covering the racialized notion of the “Real American” — accelerated this idea, which posited that Democrats had to soften their advocacy on progressive social issues if they wanted to win elections. However, such a shift in strategy runs the risk of compromising Democratic ideals, particularly on immigration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In recent days, the ​Pew Research Center has released <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/">survey​s</a> that reinforce this point of view and starkly contradict exit polling data. Multiple studies have shown that the ​proportion​ of white voters without a college degree was severely underestimated.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/upshot/trump-losing-college-educated-whites-he-never-won-them-in-the-first-place.html"> Exit polls</a> estimated that the white working class — used here to indicate whites without a college degree — comprised 34 percent of the total 2016 electorate. In reality, they cast <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/upshot/trump-losing-college-educated-whites-he-never-won-them-in-the-first-place.html">44 percent of votes</a>, a disparity of 13.5 million individuals. Moreover, initial exit polls had concluded that whites with a college degree were the largest demographic in the Democratic party. In fact, non-college-educated whites are the largest bloc of the party’s voters, outnumbering whites with a college degree by 33 to 28 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is a reckoning for the Democratic party; it repudiates the idea that supposed “elites” are the overwhelming force on the left. At the same time, however, it magnifies the white working-class bloc even more in elections — affirming the beliefs of those advocating that Democrats move further to the center. This is distressing for progressives, who had found solace in viewing the white working class as more or less a lost or relatively unimportant cause, particularly given the overwhelming support for Democrats among nonwhite voters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The revelation that non-college-educated white voters make up almost half of the electorate could be the impetus for moderating actions, like easing the party stance on abortion or gun control. Conor Lamb, who won a Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump carried by 20 points, marketed himself as this sort of Democrat. In addition to being pro-life and pro-gun, he even ran ads where he explicitly opposed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and her “California liberalism.” However, in the case of a general national election, there is reason to believe these moderating tactics would not suffice, primarily because of one unresolvable issue: immigration. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Social scientists who analyze the cultural divide among electoral voting blocs have focused on immigration as the wedge issue. This is not surprising; Trump harnessed his initial support by taking a hard line on immigration. By arguing broadly against immigration​ — rather than debating policy around reforming the system — he shifted the paradigm surrounding the immigration debate within national politics. Through his championing of a border wall and his denigration of foreigners entering the country, he coalesced the ardent support of non-college-educated white voters. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The immigration debate is a flashpoint into the larger divide between college-educated and non-college-educated white voters. College-educated whites believe that immigrants strengthen the country by a margin of 52 to 35 percent; conversely, 61 percent of white working-class voters — defined by the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/06/24/on-immigration-the-white-working-class-is-fearful/">study in question</a> as whites who did not graduate from college and are paid by the job or by the hour — say that immigrants weaken the nation. ​William Galston of the Brookings Institute​ incisively notes the larger forces at work in these numbers: “working-class whites are experiencing a pervasive sense of vulnerability … on every front — economic, cultural, personal security — they feel threatened and beleaguered.” Trump won these voters by a much larger margin than Mitt Romney did in 2012 because he made immigration an issue of race politics, not of policy. Amongst voters who listed immigration as the biggest issue in the election, 64 percent voted for Trump, compared to 32 percent for Clinton.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pew’s realization of the magnified influence of non-college-educated white voters, then, is somewhat alarming for Democrats. Looking at immigration as a flashpoint, the argument could be made that attempting to moderate on cultural issues like gun control would not be enough in a general election against a Republican party that has shifted toward the views of extremists like Sen. Tom Cotton, R-AR, on immigration. In the 2012 election, both parties made the question of immigration one of reform. Trump made it a far more personal question: Who belongs in this country? The resonance of his stance is clear; there is still substantial support among Trump voters for a border wall, a physical bulwark for those attempting to hold on to their cultural status.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For Democrats, while the data advocate an even stronger push toward the moderate white voter, the debate regarding immigration could stand as an uncrossable threshold. This ought to catalyze deeper debate regarding strategy in the next general election: Should Democrats be focused on turnout of progressive voters, or persuasion of the elusive “Obama-Trump” voter? This is an incomplete picture and does not acknowledge issues such as racially targeted voter suppression or Russian interference. But the partisan — and cultural — divide between college-educated and non-college-educated white voters implies that the perception of the status of whites in this country was the wedge issue upon which Trump seized support.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Engaging in nativist and racist rhetoric on immigration is obviously a line in the sand that Democrats will not and should not cross. But the resonance of the immigration debate goes far deeper than other cultural issues in voters’ attitudes. The “Obama-Trump” voter, whose vote Democrats so badly covet, may not be persuaded by slight moves to the center from Democrats. And if the Democratic ticket ignores the progressive wing of the party on too many social issues, they risk alienating more voters from the left than they would win over on the right.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Various graduate student union groups have withdrawn their petitions to unionize amid personnel changes at the National Labor Relations Board. But at the University, Stand Up for Graduate Student Employees and the University continue to negotiate a pre-election agreement for graduate student unionization. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Unions (at other universities) have made a strategic decision to withdraw their petitions, … so that they avoid the risk of a decision by the (NLRB) that would overturn their right to organize,” said Provost Richard Locke P’18.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the University’s campus, SUGSE — which already has the minimum support necessary to prompt an election, according to its card campaign —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>plans to file for an election with the NLRB once the pre-election agreement is finalized, said Lubabah Chowdhury GS, a member of SUGSE.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The composition of the NLRB has affected the ruling on whether graduate students are employees — which would allow them to unionize — said William Herbert, executive director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions. Currently, two Democrats appointed by former President Barack Obama and two Republicans appointed by President Trump sit on the NLRB, while one more board member — nominated by Trump — is waiting for Senate confirmation, Herbert added. This Trump-era board has already reversed labor-friendly rulings made by the Obama-era board, according to a Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-workers-union-rights-2017_us_5a42b5b1e4b025f99e187ea5">article</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The political affiliations of the board members have led to repeated changes in the NLRB’s rulings, Herbert said. In a 2016 case, for example, the board “ruled in Columbia University that graduate student employees are employees (under federal law)” entitled to collective bargaining rights, “overturning a prior decision in Brown University” that ruled in 2004 that graduate students are not employees under federal law, Herbert said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even with the flux at the NLRB, SUGSE and the University are still working on an agreement that will lead to SUGSE filing for an election on whether to unionize, Chowdhury said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though Locke said the University will respect whatever NLRB ruling is in effect, Chowdhury expressed concern with this stance. The University “puts us in a very precarious position because if the ruling is overturned, does that mean you won’t respect our voices?” Chowdhury said. “It would be great if we could get language in this (pre-election) agreement that would guarantee (administrative) compliance with the democratic will of the graduate student body.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is unclear if a change in the NLRB’s ruling would affect whether the University respects the outcome of an election. “If it’s a fair and free election and the graduate students vote for it, we have said that we would recognize that decision and … see if we can work on a collective bargaining agreement,” Locke said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University has met with SUGSE to draft the pre-election agreement since the start of the fall semester, Locke said. Two drafts of the agreement have been reviewed both this semester and last semester, but the two parties have yet to reach an agreement. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We could have had a pre-election agreement last semester,” Chowdhury said. “They’ve taken a long time to get back to us.” A pre-election agreement is not part of the NLRB procedure for unionization, but SUGSE sees the agreement as necessary to ensure the University respects the results of the election, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lawyers at the American Federation of Teachers — the union that graduate students voted to affiliate with — and the University’s external counsel, Proskauer Rose LLP, wrote the most recent draft of the agreement, Locke said. But “most of the things we had talked about for a couple of months suddenly weren’t in (the agreement),” Locke said. “We were almost going back to square one,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Given that the Republican-controlled Senate will likely confirm someone less friendly to unionization, which would give the Trump appointees a majority on the NLRB, many graduate student groups have decided to withdraw their unionization petitions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“We didn’t want to put (the decision) in the hands of a group that at this point we know leans away from labor,” said Bryn Spielvogel, a graduate student at Boston College and member of the Boston College Graduate Employees Union that decided to withdraw its petition. Although the administration at Boston College opposes unionization, the Graduate Employees Union will seek voluntary recognition of the union from its administration, Spielvogel said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Other groups at universities such as the University of Chicago, Penn and Yale have made similar decisions to withdraw their petitions in the last few months. In a statement on its <a href="http://www.uchicagogsu.org/2018/02/14/how-well-win-our-contract/">website</a>, Graduate Students United at the University of Chicago wrote in February that the withdrawal was made “to prevent the University of Chicago from using the Trump administration to overturn the Columbia precedent.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">New York University is the only private university to have recognized a graduate student union, though the unions already exist at public universities such as the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison, since the law is different for the public sector, Herbert said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Most recently, Georgetown University, whose administration had opposed unionization, decided to let graduate students hold an election on unionization overseen by a third party, not the NLRB, according to the <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/04/02/georgetown-university-softens-position-against-grad-union/?utm_term=.c91d99979615">Washington Post</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I don’t see people being swayed by what other grad worker unions are deciding to do,” Chowdhury said of graduate students at the University. “SUGSE’s goal is to ratify an agreement that will allow for a free and fair election … outside of Trump’s influence and outside of administrative influence as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Brown has been different from the other universities,” Locke said. “We have not only not engaged in an anti-union campaign, but we have also said we would respect the August 2016 (Columbia) decision as long as it remains the rule.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This is a “crucial moment because the law is in our favor,” Chowdhury said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Funding for Off-Campus Work-Study program falls short</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ever since the Swearer Center for Public Service streamlined the application process for Off-Campus Federal Work-Study last semester, the OCFWS program has attracted more students than its limited funding can support.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The program allows students who qualify for Federal Work-Study to get paid for their off-campus community service through the Swearer Center. <span class="s1">“Instead of having 35 students in (OCFWS) during the school year as was the case in the past, we had over a hundred students who wanted to participate,” said Betsy Shimberg, assistant dean of the college and director of student development at the Swearer Center.</span></p>
<p class="p2">As a result, some applicants have been turned away from the OCFWS program, with about 25 students currently on a waitlist. Students and faculty alike have concluded that the OCFWS program needs more funding to meet growing student demand for off-campus positions, Shimberg said. Many low-income students face a trade-off between engaging in the community and working to support themselves, Shimberg explained. By paying students to work off-campus, the OCFWS program allows students “to be involved in the community … and to make some money doing it,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of the $1.3 million the University receives from the federal government for work-study, 7 percent — the federally required minimum — is allocated to OCFWS, said Dean of Financial Aid Jim Tilton. This 7 percent allocation falls far below the percentage of Federal Work-Study funding that most peer schools devote to off-campus work, according to research conducted by the student employment working group that Tilton chaired.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To align the University with its peers and provide more opportunities for student employment in the local community, the student employment working group recommended that the University allocate 10 percent of its Federal Work-Study funding to OCFWS. If the administration accepts the proposal for this funding increase — which Tilton is currently drafting along with the Swearer Center — then funding for the OCFWS program would rise from around $91,000 to $130,000, Tilton said. Additionally, Tilton plans to work with the Swearer Center to reevaluate annually the needs of the OCFWS program. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Shimberg said she thinks that Tilton’s proposal, if accepted, would allow the Swearer Center to provide OCFWS positions to all the students currently on the waitlist for the program. Furthermore, students in OCFWS would be able to work more in order to earn more under the potential funding increase, Shimberg added.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Separately, students on the Swearer Center’s Student Advisory Committee recommended doubling the allocation for OCFWS to 14 percent of Federal Work-Study funding, said Ethan Morelion ’20, a member of the SAC in the Swearer Center. Although Morelion believes the OCFWS program could use more than 10 percent of the University’s Federal Work-Study funding, he expressed support for the incremental funding increase and annual reviews that Tilton plans to propose. “We’re definitely going to continue to push for 14 percent,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We don’t want to turn people down from being involved in community engagement because there’s always a community need for more people to be involved,” Morelion added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tilton emphasized that increasing the portion of Federal Work-Study funding devoted to off-campus work would </span>not decrease the funds available for on-campus work. “We spend much more on student employment than we receive (from the federal government) in work-study (funding),” Tilton said, noting that the University’s student employment budget exceeds $5 million. “Through the operations budget, we fund student employment. It isn’t that we’re taking away (from) one to give to another.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mikaela Karlsson ’18, a SAC member who is currently involved in OCFWS, has worked both on campus at the Nelson Fitness Center and off campus at a community organization called DownCity Design. She said her off-campus work has been far more valuable to her than her on-campus work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s just so much more opportunity for skill-building when you’re working with a community partner,” Karlsson said. “If you’re working for BUDS or working at the front desk at the Nelson, there’s not as much opportunity for growth.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Carmen Ferran ’20.5 is paid to participate in the Brown Elementary After-School Mentoring program through off-campus work-study. If it weren’t for OCFWS, Ferran said she wouldn’t be able to participate in BEAM. Ferran added that she is grateful that OCFWS allows her to explore nonprofit work while earning “enough spending money to get by.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ferran and Karlsson both hope that the OCFWS program will receive increased funding to expand off-campus employment opportunities. “More kids should have the opportunity to work in the city and contribute to public good … and also not be broke during the school year,” Ferran said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Community engagement should not be limited to those who can afford to take unpaid or low-paying internships,” Karlsson agreed.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Joukowsky Forum addresses U.S. Senate partisanship</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Ira Shapiro, president of Ira Shapiro Global Strategies LLC, discussed the state of the U.S. Senate at the Joukowsky Forum in the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs Wednesday. The panel, which featured Shapiro, University faculty and a guest from the American Enterprise Institute, considered themes from Shapiro’s new book, “Broken: Can the Senate Save Itself and the Country?”</p>
<p class="p4">“The Senate is ground zero for the failure of our democracy,” Shapiro said. “The Senate is supposed to be the place where the diverse interests of our society get reconciled … if you take that out of the equation, the Senate fails but then the whole political system seizes up. And that’s what we’ve seen happening over a long period of time.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, Shapiro viewed the Senate as a “beacon of hope” and an institution that supports “progressive policies and ideas,” he said. By the 1990s, Shapiro saw senators become increasingly more engaged in “politics of political destruction” and “permanent campaigning” to stay in office — the beginning of a “long, gradual decline.” In the last decade, the Senate took a “deep dive” under the leadership of Senator Mitch McConnell, Shapiro said, citing McConnell’s fight against an Obama-era economic stimulus bill desperately needed by the American people.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“When it was possible to bring people together, when the country needed bipartisanship, (McConnell) … failed to do it,” Shapiro said.“He has turned the Senate into a partisan instrument.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Around the time of the 2016 election, Shapiro began writing about the Senate’s need for reform in order for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to be successful upon election. But once President Trump took office, the book acquired a “new sense of urgency,” Shapiro said. He believes the Senate is ineffective in curbing the “real prospect of an overreaching authoritarian president,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute Norman Ornstein, who sat on the panel, pointed to the increasing polarization in recent years as reason for the Senate’s inefficacy. While the rule of the filibuster has been in place for four decades and traditionally was invoked by the minority only in moments of considerable national importance, it has become a modern “weapon of mass obstruction” under McConnell’s guidance, Ornstein said. The tendency of senators to engage in “tribalism,” or to vilify opposing party members and refuse to work across the aisle has also contributed to gridlock in the Senate, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Ornstein warned that these “headaches” will only multiply as time progresses, in part because Senate seats are not allocated based on population. He estimated that by 2040, 70 percent of Americans will live in 15 states — at that point, 30 percent of Americans will be responsible for electing 70 senators. “As our country becomes more urban, more diverse and younger, the Senate is going to become increasingly unrepresentative of the country,” Ornstein said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Professor of Political Science and International and Public Affairs and Chair of the Political Science Department Wendy Schiller said that the Senate currently serves as a means for politicians to make their name by obstructing legislation. But this is not a new practice, Schiller said. Rather, what is novel is the increasing number of senators taking advantage of the institution.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Schiller wrote a review of Shapiro’s book in the Washington Monthly in which she critiqued his romanticization of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">“The problem with looking backward when things are difficult in the current age is that we tend to put a silk screen across everything we see, making it softer and prettier than it really was,” Schiller said. “The Senate of yesteryear was not representative either demographically or economically” of the American constituency due to its paucity of female, African American and Latino elected officials, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4">She also affirmed that the Senate today is a far more diverse place demographically than it has been in the past. The Senate is comprised of 22 female senators, a cohort that includes one black woman, one Pacific Islander woman and one Latina woman.</p>
<p class="p4">Visiting Lecturer in Political Science Richard Arenberg cited the “necessary evil of money” and the “24-hour media cycle” that rewards “sound bites over substance” as contributors to the Senate’s decline.</p>
<p class="p4">Looking forward, Shapiro said that a small, bipartisan group has the potential to change the dynamic of the Senate body. But Schiller believes that voters will ultimately be the ones to change the Senate most.</p>
<p class="p4">“Elect people who have demonstrated some capacity to govern, who care about government and are willing to cross the aisle on some things,” Schiller said.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3"> Throughout the first half of April, five programs at Brown are partnering to discuss, teach and learn about the environment through a range of perspectives with a focus on collaboration. Through the initiative “WeatherProof: Arts, Humanities and Sciences Explore the Environment,” these distinct programs will weave across barriers to examine environmental issues with a multidisciplinary lens. Each of the events is free and open to the public. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>The Bell Gallery </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The latest exhibition at the David Winton Bell Gallery, “33˚,” focuses on the melting polar ice that is a result of climate change. The keystone of the exhibition is Jacob Kirkegaard’s sound environment, “Isfald (Icefall),” an immersive sound experience housed within a curtained-off section of the Bell Gallery. Produced through the use of tools such as contact microphones and hydrophones, the piece captures the sounds of melting ice caps, ranging from the soft drops of water to loud, booming cracks.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“He’s literally trying to help your ears physically engage with the sound of cleaving ice in the Arctic,” said Ian Russell, curator of the Bell Gallery. Russell added that he hopes “that Jacob’s work touches people, and that maybe it makes people feel like the problem isn’t quite so far away.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Works by contemporary photographers Olaf Otto Becker and Camille Seaman are on view throughout the List Art Building to accompany the “Isfald.” “We prefer to show groupings of work or series,” as the artists are better able to “communicate the extent to how they are viewing or engaging an area or region,” Russell said. But the exhibition extends beyond the walls of the gallery. Five large prints hang off of various campus buildings’ exteriors as public art murals, featuring images by Becker and Seaman as well as photographs by Iain Brownlie Roy, Jean de Pomereu and James Balog. The print located on the List Art Building depicts people standing and posing for photographs on waves of bright white ice.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The exhibition, curated by Director of the Bell Gallery Jo-Ann Conklin, was developed alongside the Brown Arts Initiative’s three-year theme of Arts and Environment, a coordination that Anne Bergeron, managing director of the BAI, said “was very purposeful.” </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Kirkegaard will be speaking at the opening reception of the exhibition April 6, and will present his sound concert “Labryinthitis” April 7. The exhibition will show through May 27.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>The Brown Arts Initiative </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The Brown Arts Initiative symposium, “Polar Opposites: Creative Interventions in the Arctic and Antarctica,” will gather artists, scientists, scholars and musicians, among other experts, to the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“We are bringing together artists and scientists and researchers who are working in a kind of cross-platform way to address something of a great deal of significance to contemporary society,” Bergeron said of the focus on polar regions. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The keynote speaker, filmmaker David Buckland, is the founder and director of Cape Farewell, a multidisciplinary, international effort to culturally respond to climate change. Bergeron said that the program was founded after Buckland came to the realization that the combination of efforts by artists and scientists would allow for a better understanding and approach to the issues of climate change — a mindset similar to the core values of the the BAI and the WeatherProof programs. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“This is … one of the things that Brown does really well — it has porous borders in terms of disciplines and it … regularly reaches out beyond. One of the things that we are trying to do through the construct of WeatherProof is to make that visible,” Bergeron said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The Polar Opposites keynote address and panels, “Knowing Ice” and “Art, Polarities and Politics,” will take place April 5 and 6 at the Granoff Center. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>The Cogut Institute </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Earth(ly) Matters: New Directions in Environmental Humanities,” hosted by the Cogut Institute for the Humanities, will assemble over a dozen speakers in an effort to coalesce multiple fields, ranging from new media arts to the social sciences. The theme of this year’s season at the Cogut Institute is environmental humanities, a theme that has been studied before at the Institute, and that represents a “conjunction of energies” among Institute scholars, said Damien Mahiet, associate director of the Cogut Institute. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“The environmental humanities is really a conglomerate of researchers trying to tackle questions that have to do with how to better live on this planet” from fields beyond those that directly affect life on Earth, said Iris Montero, a postdoctoral fellow at the Cogut Institute. “We’re basically trying to think from our different standpoints about all the ways that we have engaged with nature in the past, how those ways have been communicated through different means in literature, in the different arts, and what those representations … can tell us for future directions,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">While the Cogut Insitute considers today’s issues, its focus extends to the “longer history and broader history of the environment … and the relationship between humans and non-humans,” Mahiet said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The conference serves as an opportunity for scholars to come together and exchange notes, Montero said, while also offering them the opportunity to relay this information to a wider audience. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Earth(ly) Matters will take place April 6 and 7 at the Cogut Institute in Pembroke Hall. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>IBES and the John Carter Brown Library </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Water’s Edge” is this year’s rendition of the interdisciplinary program “Earth, Itself,” sponsored by the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. The theme of water marks the final element in the fourth year of the series, following the inaugural themes of earth, air and fire. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“The advantage of the classic elements is that it’s accessible in terms of how you think about issues and how ideas have moved forward,” said Lenore Manderson, the director of “Earth, Itself” and visiting professor of anthropology. “I really used a particular element as a theme around which to build questions about the environment, environmental change (and) climate change,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Following a tradition of connecting scientific discussion with related specific art forms, this year’s program focuses on text through two days of poetry readings, as well as discussions around water as an inspiration for writing, Manderson said. A film by Wendy Woodson, “Sourcing the Stream,” was also shown at the opening program April 3 hosted by the John Carter Brown Library, and is now showing in the lobby of the IBES building. </span></p>
<p class="p6">The interdisciplinary approach of the “Earth, Itself” program gears its message toward the general public, Menderson said, while also giving scientists, artists and writers the chance to reflect on each other’s work. She added that this was exemplifed at the opening film screening and its corresponding panel event.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"> “What has been so exciting has been the capacity for people to collaborate or to share a space and to recognize that each reflects on what the other is talking about,” she said, adding that the interdisciplinary approach “gives a legitimacy to the insights that artists provide.” </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Water’s Edge will host events through April 13, including a film night, flash lecture competition, poster competition and various panels. The next seminar, “Writing on Water,” will take place in two sessions over April 12 and 13. The John Carter Brown Library exhibition, “Fluidity: Knowing Water in the Americas,” will show from May 1 to June 30, following the opening symposium that took place April 3.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b> Study sheds light on ALS development, potential treatment options</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">An international team of researchers, including Thomas Serre, associate professor of CLPS, Justin Fallon, professor of medical science, Amanda Duffy GS, PhD candidate in the neuroscience department, and Youssef Barhomi, research assistant for the Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences department, studied and conducted tests on mice that were genetically modified to carry TDP-43, a protein that causes a hereditary form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in humans, according to a University <a href="http://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/als">press release</a> published last month.</p>
<p class="p2">Through their examinations of the ALS<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>developing in the mice, the scientists discovered that “behavioral, cognitive and structural dysfunctions …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>were evident long before the neuronal degeneration that occurs late” in the disease. Researchers also found that unlike other degenerative diseases that result in early losses of excitatory neurons, the early development of ALS yielded a loss of inhibitory neurons, according to the release.</p>
<p class="p2">In addition to functioning as the basis of future research into ALS and providing opportunities to possibly create therapies treating ALS in its early stages, the study underscores progress in the creation of animal models that mimic ALS symptoms in research.</p>
<p class="p2">Additionally, the Automated Continuous Behavioral Monitoring system, an artificial intelligence technology developed at Brown, played a critical role in allowing researchers to study the mice closely and accurately for extensive periods of time.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Study links visual cues to vowel perception </b></span></p>
<p class="p2">A study conducted by researchers at the University and at McGill University found that when people perceive speech, they rely heavily on visual cues, closely watching the movement and form of the lips, according to a University <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/speech">press release</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">To reach this conclusion, researchers tested individuals’ “directional asymmetry” when visually perceiving vowels. Directionally asymmetry allows people to better distinguish “between two versions of the ‘oo’ sound,” according to the release.</p>
<p class="p2">During the study, researchers had volunteers listen to a “bilingual Canadian woman” make “oo”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sounds in English and French, so they could determine what visual information and cues were pertinent to directional asymmetry. Directional asymmetry can be seen in Canadians who speak French and English because in French, the “oo” is more pronounced than in English.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Researchers led by U. professor discover new antibiotics to combat superbugs </b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Last month, a team of researchers led by Eleftherios Mylonakis, a professor of infectious diseases at the Alpert Medical School, discovered a new class of antibiotics that could potentially combat superbugs, bacteria that have developed a resistance to conventional antibiotics, according to a University <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/mrsa">press release</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Specifically, researchers identified two synthetic retinoids that exhibited an ability to kill MRSA, a “staph bacteria that is resistant to several antibiotics.” These retinoids impair bacterial membranes and destroy MRSA “persister” cells “that are drug-resistant dormant cells,” according to the release. Additionally, the team created new ways to screen over 80,000 synthetic compounds to find potential antibiotics that are not toxic to humans.</p>
<p class="p2">To carry out the study Mylonakis worked with specialists from Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Massachusetts General Hospital, Emory University and Northwestern University.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mulligan &#039;19: Class of 2022: Is the open curriculum for you?</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/04/mulligan-19-class-of-2022-is-the-open-curriculum-for-you/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As potential members of the class of 2022 ponder whether or not to accept Brown’s offer of admission, many of them will no doubt be swayed by the open curriculum. Whenever I hear conversations among my peers about why we chose Brown, the opportunity to forge our own academic path inevitably emerges as a top reason.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yet as semesters pass, I find myself evaluating the open curriculum with a more balanced eye, and from conversations I’ve overheard among classmates, I know I’m not alone. The open curriculum is a key component of the Brown experience but evaluating it without rose-colored glasses would help us see what we really want from our education. Reflection would allow potential students to develop a better perspective on whether Brown is the place for them.</span></p>
<p class="p3">A quick review: According to a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/curriculum">University webpage</a>, the open curriculum, which was instated almost fifty years ago, is designed to allow students “maximum flexibility” in their education. While students must complete a concentration and demonstrate competency in written communication, they are otherwise free to choose how they spend their academic time. Unlike most colleges, Brown students are not required to take a foreign language, a science class with a laboratory component or any other general educational requirement.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There are many benefits to this freedom. Because students do not have to spend course hours attaining mandatory credits, it is easier to have multiple concentrations. The ease of double concentrating, as compared to schools where a second major must be completed </span><span class="s2">on top of core requirements, means that students can add an additional concentration if they discover a new area of academic interest later in their time at Brown. It is also easier for students to combine seemingly disparate areas of study. I know people who concentrate in visual art while on a pre-med path, or who double concentrate in computer science and classics. While these paths would be possible at other universities, there’s no doubt that they would be harder to follow if general educational requirements got in the way.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But while some students rise to the challenge offered by the open curriculum, others use it as a safety net. Double concentrating in two humanities, I can’t count the number of times I’ve heard my classmates joke about having not taken a math or science course since high school. The open curriculum makes it possible to explore courses in departments that you would not have had time for if burdened with general educational requirements, but at the same time, it makes it entirely possible to stay confined within your comfort zone.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is something to be said for being able to dive deeply into one subject as an undergraduate. As a first-year, I was already taking courses in my concentrations while my friends at other schools spent their first few semesters solely fulfilling distribution requirements. The open curriculum makes it possible to focus intensely on one area of academia, taking more courses in one department than a student at a different school would have the opportunity to.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The problem with comfort zones isn’t that they limit your studies to an area you love — it’s that they keep you from discovering new interests. I have always enjoyed studying history and English, but I realized recently that I would have benefited from a stronger foundation in sociology and anthropology. Like many students, I was not exposed to these subjects in high school, and so I went several years without fully understanding how they would supplement my education. And I fully admit that I am one of those concentrators in the humanities who has used the open curriculum to avoid subjects that sound unappealing. Though I have explored many departments, I have only taken one STEM class. My education has helped me learn to think in a variety of ways, but I’m not sure I have “Experience(d) Scientific Inquiry,” one of Brown’s Liberal Learning Goals.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As an upperclassman, I’ve occasionally found myself wishing that when I first came to Brown, I was forced to take courses outside of my known academic interests. It’s hard enough <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/20/mulligan-19-re-orientating-attitude-toward-loneliness/">adjusting to college</a> in the first place, and amid the chaos of living in an entirely new environment, I expect it’s normal to focus on classes that instantly pique your interest. Yet I wonder if I would have discovered some latent interest if I had been required to explore other curricular areas early in my time at Brown. It’s a bit too late to completely upend my academic plans, though I have been trying to take courses in new departments. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m reminded of something a classmate, also a junior and also double concentrating in two non-STEM subjects, said recently: If she could redo her time at Brown, she would be majoring in two hard sciences, subjects to which she had only recently been introduced. As a first-year, she was too intimidated to enroll in courses she worried she would not do well in.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Perhaps, then, the problem here isn’t the open curriculum itself, but that it allows us to run from our fear of failure. The students who come here are generally used to succeeding, and even measures like taking any course S/NC or not having a GPA don’t reduce the emotional difficulty of dealing with a poor grade. That’s a problem that won’t go away without a major culture shift, and although the open curriculum may exacerbate it by letting students avoid potential failures, its existence is not the open curriculum’s fault.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As admitted students choose whether or not to attend Brown, the open curriculum will likely factor into their decision, one way or another. I encourage them to think about what it offers and what its limitations are. Do you want to explore academically? And if so, do you feel able to do that yourself, or would you benefit from outside assistance? The open curriculum is an excellent opportunity but it isn’t inherently better than a traditional curriculum, and acknowledging that can help determine if Brown offers the opportunities to grow that a student seeks.</span></p>

		<title>Bohman &#039;18: Heavy petting should consider dogs’ needs too</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have hesitated a long time to write this column. I know this issue could make me a pariah on campus, but, as a senior, I guess it’s time to go out with a bang. I have a confession to make: I hate Heavy Petting. I think it’s dangerous. Here’s why.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I am a dog trainer and dog sport competitor, and Heavy Petting runs counter to everything I know about dogs. My dog is a certified therapy dog, and as the handler, I was always taught to put his needs first. If he’s not having fun or enjoying the experience, we leave. I left Heavy Petting and never went back because it was too overwhelming for him because there were dogs running off leash and large dogs and small dogs all crammed together. This is not an environment many dogs feel comfortable or able to concentrate in. It’s true that some dogs enjoy going to the dog park, but they generally don’t go there to be patted by college students. Even when my dog and I compete in dog sport competitions, where there are 35 dogs in a small space, competitors are required to keep our dogs crated and bring them out only for their run.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Heavy Petting also presents a safety issue. A dog surrounded by a million canines and people is probably a stressed-out dog. Based on my previous experiences attending Heavy Petting and talking to University administrators, I was led to believe that BWell Health Promotion, which runs Heavy Petting, has not, in the past, tested dogs for temperament or suitability before the event. Until recently, BWell didn’t even require that the dogs be on a leash or provide supervision for the event. I am frankly unsure of how Heavy Petting has continued under the aegis of the University’s lawyers, who may have reason to be skeptical of dog events. Given the way Heavy Petting is run, I believe it is just a matter of time before there is a dog fight or someone gets hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I want to acknowledge that I do run the other dog therapy club, Brown Animal Assisted Therapy, on campus, which was founded with the idea of providing a different type service from Heavy Petting through individual appointments. However, we would be happy to see a thriving Heavy Petting program on campus — trust me, there’s enough demand.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And there are ways that BWell could run Heavy Petting more safely. There are groups of registered therapy dogs in Rhode Island who only do events like this — I have been contacted by several. If they wanted to stick with faculty members’ dogs, they could have a dog trainer evaluate the dogs for suitability: Every dog could get a certificate before coming to Heavy Petting. They could have separate areas for large and small dogs. They could implement crowd control measures for participants. They could invest in moveable fences so that each dog could have its own space. But many of these measures would require a significant expenditure of effort by the University, which is why I believe they have not happened yet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ultimately, I would like to add that I did not make this public statement without first privately speaking to many members of both the administration and BWell. I am open to hearing that changes are being made that I perhaps have not been informed of, but from my perspective, nothing has changed in the three years I have been here. As Brown students, we should demand better — not only for dogs, but for ourselves. Heavy petting is a fun event, but it can be fun and safe at the same time.</span></p>

		<title>University expands role in National Public Health Week</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Under the Dean of the School of Public Health Bess Marcus, Brown has increased its efforts to promote public health and educate the community. This week, the school planned activities for National Public Health Week, which included symposiums, poster sessions and advocacy events aimed at educating the Providence community about the many facets of public health. Though the event has taken place for many years under the American Public Health Association, this is the first year that the school planned events for the entire week, as opposed to only organizing a Public Health Research Day as in previous years.</p>
<p class="p4">Brown’s renewed involvement is part of Marcus’ effort to highlight the school’s work in the community. “I’m a new dean, and I really wanted to call attention to all of the great work that our students are involved in, our faculty are involved in and what we’re doing as a community,” Marcus said, adding that she hopes to raise the school’s profile. “We focus on research, we focus on teaching and education and we focus on service to the community, and this week is about celebrating all those parts,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">The school hopes to educate the wider community about public health as well. “It’s really a great opportunity for the School of Public Health to reach out to the greater Brown community and the greater Providence community to really put on these fantastic events that celebrate public health,” said Meghan Gonsalves GS, a health communications scholar who worked to promote this week’s events.</p>
<p class="p4">Notable events for the week included a panel on tobacco use, an event addressing obesity in the United States and a healthy cooking demonstration.</p>
<p class="p4">On Tuesday, a public art project entitled “One Gun Gone” advocated for gun control by displaying art pieces with weapons to raise funds for a buy-back program and further aid families affected by gun violence. “Hearing personal stories from students and people who have been affected by (gun violence) is really compelling,” Gonsalves said, adding that “to see the guns in an art form of wax and glass rather than hard metal is a very interesting way to view it.”</p>
<p class="p4">One of the busiest days of the week was the Public Health Research Day, where undergraduate and graduate students prepared posters to present their own research. “Research day is the culmination of all of the activities and interests students have in research,” said Director of Public Health Communications Karen Scanlan.</p>
<p class="p4">Students wrote abstracts and created posters to present to peers, other researchers and faculty. “This is a fantastic opportunity for students to push their research and get involved with teaching others about what they do,” Gonsalves said. She added that she hoped presenters would also gain confidence and form connections with other researchers in the field, a key goal of the week.</p>
<p class="p4">Marcus said she hoped that the event would spur future research. “They’re the next generation. They’re going to take all that we’re doing forward,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Though the week focused on public health, it aimed to encourage people of all concentrations to take part as well. “This week is for everybody. Public health touches every single person’s life in some way because it’s how we act, what we do, our health and everything that affects an individual,” Gonsalves said.</p>
<p class="p4">Marcus hopes that events like these will continue to grow in the near future. “This is really just the beginning of what we’re hoping to do,” she added. “You’ll see more partnerships with other programs at (Brown) … and us partnering with more of our community partners in coming years.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The softball team won its second conference game of the season last weekend, earning a 4-0 victory against Penn at home. The team was led by starting pitcher Emily Waters ’20, who pitched a complete game shutout and allowed only four hits and three walks with no errors. The Bears scored a pair of runs in both the third and fourth innings to help defeat the Quakers and move to 2-4 in the Ivy League.</p>
<p class="p4">Waters, a sophomore from Northridge, California, is a right-handed ace for Bruno. With her most recent victory, she holds a 2-5 mark on the season and has recorded 16 total strikeouts. For her outstanding performance in the victory against Penn, Waters has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the win against Penn. Can you talk a little about the game and how it felt to play so well?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Waters: Thank you! Coming into it, I felt pretty confident because I think we did a really good job scouting. We had a good plan and stuck to it, and everything just went smoothly with no hiccups.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When did you first start playing softball and when did you become a pitcher?</b></p>
<p class="p3">When I was about six years old, I think. My mom played softball growing up, and she was a pitcher. So, that’s what she just taught me to do growing up.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When did you decide that you wanted to play softball in college?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Probably in middle school. I started getting into travel ball, being more competitive and seeing some of the older girls in my organization going on to play in college. So, I thought that was something that I wanted to do.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I’m from California, so I was looking at schools on the West Coast like (the University of California at San Diego and St. Mary’s College of California). And then looking on the East Coast, it was basically just Brown. So for me, it was go home or go away. And I guess I wanted to experience something new and come to the East Coast. When I visited Brown, I loved it. I loved the girls that were on the team already (who) kind of showed me around.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>What is your favorite part of being on the softball team?</b></p>
<p class="p3">It’s like having another family. I don’t really get homesick being here because it’s like I have my own little family. The older girls are like mentors and I can go to them for anything.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Do you have any pregame rituals?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I do not. I guess I do my hair the same way every day (that I pitch). That’s about it.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>What are some of your team and personal goals for the season?</b></p>
<p class="p3">(For) team goals, probably to be competitive in the Ivy League. Our goals are always to be above .500 in the Ivy League. I think we are on our way to doing that. Personal goals for me (are) just to be pitching well as a team. As a pitcher, you don’t want to win games for your team. You just want to keep your team in the game.</p>
<p class="p3">The Bears will return to the field this weekend to host Cornell before facing the University of Rhode Island Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">A bipartisan discussion about U.S. policy in the Middle East rehashed long-standing disagreements but found common ground in positioning foreign policy moving forward. The talk, which was co-hosted by Brown Students for Israel and the American Enterprise Institute at Brown, featured Brian Katulis, senior fellow from liberal thinktank Center for American Progress, and Michael Rubin, resident scholar at conservative thinktank American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p class="p4">Katulis and Rubin debated the history of U.S. intervention in Iraq and how current regional changes would affect U.S. policy. Katulis worked at the National Security Council and the U.S. Departments of State and Defense under the Clinton administration. Rubin, whose area of expertise is Iran, served as a staff adviser for Iran and Iraq at the Pentagon from 2002 to 2004. Brian Atwood, senior fellow at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, moderated the discussion.</p>
<p class="p4">The speakers clashed on the subject of the Iraq War, to which Katulis said he was vehemently opposed. On the other hand, Rubin said he would not apologize for the war. “I did not see it as a choice. I saw it as the status quo breaking down,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Rubin also discussed his optimism regarding Iraq following his last trip to Baghdad earlier this year. “Sixty percent of Iraqis were born post 2000. Forty percent have been born after 2003,” he said. “We have a new generation that is not embracing the religious extremism and sectarian rhetoric as the panacea for their problems.”</p>
<p class="p4">Katulis and Rubin both critiqued the Obama administration’s attempts to remain impartial in the region’s conflicts, describing the strategy as “unrealistic.”</p>
<p class="p4">Rubin pointed out a lack of coherence on Middle East policy since the Clinton administration, which was exacerbated by Obama’s unwillingness to take a side.</p>
<p class="p4">“My big criticism of the Obama administration is that the Syrian civil war … has had huge strategic consequences,” Katulis said. “We would not have a President Trump today if we had had a meaningful engagement about the (war).” Terrorism and the civil war have “led to a re-emergence of the politics of fear” across the world, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">“By trying to stay neutral, it’s almost as if we are a gambler that only wants to put his cards down on the blackjack table after he’s seen everyone else’s cards,” Rubin added. “In a region where people see policy and diplomacy as a zero-sum game, people think that if the Americans aren’t supporting us, then they must be supporting the other guys.”</p>
<p class="p4">Rubin and Katulis also agreed that it is necessary for U.S. policy to evolve from its current reactionary state to a more proactive approach. “We’re all debating the past, whereas no one’s debating about the future,” Rubin said. He pointed to the eventual phasing out of restrictions included in the Iran nuclear deal and the declining health of both Ali Khamenei, supreme leader of Iran, and Mahmoud Abbas, president of the State of Palestine, as examples of topics that merit more attention.</p>
<p class="p4">When discussing the current administration, the speakers both said that they do not believe the United States will go to war with Iran. Katulis referred to a lack of concrete policy behind Trump’s actions, which he described as posturing.</p>
<p class="p4">However, he noted that conflict breaking out in the fight for dominance in the region could draw in the United States.</p>
<p class="p4">“Every administration tends to be defined (by) the crisis it never saw coming,” Rubin added.</p>
<p class="p4">The Israel-Palestine conflict was touched upon briefly, with Katulis expressing his pessimism regarding any possibility of a two-state solution.</p>
<p class="p4">“(Jared) Kushner and (Jason) Greenblatt’s quest for the perfect two-state solution is like O.J. (Simpson)’s quest for the real killer,” Rubin said. He added that he does not believe it is the most urgent problem to address within the region, because while the other Arab nations support Palestine, they are not particularly focused on the conflict.</p>
<p class="p4">Broadly, Rubin cautioned the United States against thinking inwardly, noting that it must consider how its actions will be interpreted by players in the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, will speak at the University April 25 as the Ogden Memorial lecturer. After Bush delivers a speech entitled “Leadership in a Changing World,” President Christina Paxson P’19 will moderate an audience question-and-answer session, according to a University <a href="http://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/04/bush">press release. </a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The son of former president George H.W. Bush and the younger brother of former president George W. Bush, Bush served as the 43rd governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007 and launched a presidential campaign for the Republican Party nomination in the 2016 election. Under Bush’s leadership, “Florida was on the forefront of consumer health care advances, led the nation in job growth and launched and accelerated restoration of America’s Everglades,” according to the Ogden<a href="https://www.brown.edu/ogden/people/jeb-bush"> website. </a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bush was born in Texas and went on to earn a bachelor’s degree from the University of Texas at Austin, according to the website of the Foundation for Excellence in Education, of which Bush currently serves as founder, president and chairman of the board of directors. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After moving to Florida in 1981 and co-founding the Codina Bush Group, a real estate development company, Bush stepped into the political arena by serving as Florida’s secretary of commerce under the state’s 40th governor, Bob Martinez. In 1994, he founded the Foundation for Florida’s Future, a nonprofit organization that aims to make “education in Florida a Model for the Nation,” according to its website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bush has authored three books: “Profiles in Character,” “Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution” and “Reply All: A Governor’s Story 1999-2007,” according to the press release. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Ogden Lectureship celebrates the life of Stephen Ogden Jr. ’60, who died of injuries from a car accident during his junior year. Bush will join many political figures who have taken the role as Ogden lecturer, including former United Nations Secretary-General <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/26/ban-ki-moon-reflects-time-un/">Ban Ki-moon</a> and His Highness the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/03/11/aga-khan-stresses-importance-pluralism/">Aga Khan</a>, according to the press release. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For more than 50 years, the Ogden Lectures have brought leaders from across the country and the globe to Brown for engaging discussions on pressing and timely topics. We’re pleased to welcome Gov. Bush this month and look forward to a conversation informed by his lifelong career in business and public service,” wrote Director of News and Editorial Development Brian Clark in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bush will begin his lecture at 5 p.m. at the Salomon Center. For those who are unable to obtain tickets, the event will be livestreamed.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A conversation with John Krasinski ’01</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/05/conversation-john-krasinski-01/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For nearly a decade, John Krasinski ’01 was best known for his role as Dunder Mifflin paper salesman Jim Halpert on the NBC comedy “The Office,” playing pranks on Dwight and staring down the camera with a knowing expression and a charming shrug. But in his third directorial endeavor, “A Quiet Place,” Krasinski breaks away from comedy with a horror film set in an apocalyptic world where even the slightest noise results in a violent death by human-eating creatures. The film, released today, underscores the importance of family in a pervasively threatening environment. Krasinski crafts the story of two parents ­— played by Krasinski and his wife Emily Blunt — and their young children who must learn to fiercely protect one another in the fight for survival. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Reading the script for “A Quiet Place” just three weeks after the birth of his second daughter, Krasinski said the thread of family immediately hit home. “I was already in a state of terror about whether or not I was a good enough father,” he said in a conference interview with The Herald and other university publications. Imagining being a father in a nightmare world who is so dedicated to keeping his children alive elevated the meaning of parenting to him, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This focus on family and parenting weaves throughout the entire plot as a central theme that parallels the terror, Krasinski said. Though the film has its jumpy moments, he wanted the audience to experience fear in direct correlation with love for the family. “If I can make you fall in love with this family, then you’ll be scared because you don’t want anything to happen to them,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As actor, producer and writer, Krasinski donned various hats, in addition to his role as a father in real life, to cement the family’s interdependence and center the rest of the movie around their inseparability. For him, the film is “a love letter to (his) kids.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Krasinski also regularly turned to his on-screen and real-life wife Blunt for her input and ideas. Although it was their first time working together on the same set, Blunt went above and beyond in being a collaborative contributor, giving Krasinski notes on the script and shots and being present whether or not her character acted in the scene, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Together, Krasinski and Blunt generated ideas about how to inject horror into the film. As a self-proclaimed “scaredy-cat,” Krasinski drew from his own instincts to decide what fear factors would play most effectively in each scene. While writing, Krasinski would imagine himself in the scene and think about what would scare him most and then write that very image or action into the script.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Silence plays a critical role in the film — nearly the entire first half of the screen time contains no dialogue, and the entire script is only 67 pages. But as the cast shot these scenes, Krasinski said he learned about the value of such stillness in a distractingly noisy world. “We just sat in the forest and we listened, and it was really powerful to have all of these ambient sounds around you,” he said. Krasinski has since started taking his daughter outside to “just look up at the sky and listen.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The family in the movie goes to painstaking lengths to remain silent and ensure safety by putting sand down when they walk through the forest, painting floorboards so that they don’t creak and communicating through American Sign Language. The cast learned ASL together from deaf actress Millicent Simmonds, who played the deaf daughter in the film.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There’s no better teacher for ASL than Millie because she was so kind and gentle,” Krasinski said. “I’ve never had someone take in all of me when we were communicating.” Simmonds taught the cast about how each individual has their own version of sign language — for example, the father, who focuses on keeping the children safe, has very curt and short signs, whereas the mother, who wants to give the children a larger life, has more poetic gestures. Krasinski cited his biggest regret about his directing experience as having not learned more sign language, as he believes that “there’s no more beautiful language.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Krasinski fondly recalled how his community at Brown opened up a world of exposure, impacting his work today “in every single way.” Every week for all four of his years at Brown, he would ask his group of friends to give him an album or a movie recommendation, helping him grow from a high schooler “who had never seen a movie that wasn’t in a Cineplex or listened to music that wasn’t on the radio” to the actor, director and producer he is today.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I could talk about this forever and I would probably start crying,” Krasinski said. “I legitimately would not be half the person that you see in front of you if it were not for Brown. … I wish I could go back.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In his March 5 op-ed, Dean of Admission Logan Powell argues that a fixation on legacy admission is a distraction from the University’s efforts to increase access for underrepresented groups <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/05/powell-dispelling-legacy-myths-help-focus-access/">on campus.</a> Yet while Powell highlights much of the progress the University has made in expanding access to low-income and first-generation applicants, his piece is, itself, an effort at obfuscation. Despite his best efforts to disentangle the two, the University’s legacy admission policy and its efforts at increasing access to low-income and first-generation communities are intimately connected. The University, despite its earnest efforts at increasing diversity on campus, must end the use of legacy status in admission entirely if it hopes to truly create a meritocratic admission policy that places a premium on equal access for underrepresented communities.</p>
<p class="p2">Perhaps most central to Powell’s argument is the idea that legacy admission and expanding efforts to admit low-income students are not mutually exclusive. This is true in a very technical sense, but misleading. For instance, Powell is correct in noting that the University has been making good-faith efforts to expand financial aid to low-income students and take into consideration factors like low-income and first-generation status during the admission process. Though it is true that the University can expand on these efforts while simultaneously continuing its legacy admission policy, the latter is still an obstacle to its broader objective of increasing access. Fundamentally, every spot given to a legacy applicant is one that is not given to another applicant.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, Powell attempts to preempt this argument by stating legacy status is one of many “tie-breakers.” But there is substantial evidence to suggest that this is generally untrue at elite universities. For instance, one Princeton study found that, among applicants to elite universities, having a parent that previously attended the university was equivalent to scoring an additional 160 points on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204653604577249230164868846?ns=prod/accounts-wsj">the SAT.</a> Similarly, one study of approximately 30 top universities in the United States found that legacy status increased an applicant’s chances of admission by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/04/07/why-do-colleges-still-give-preference-to-children-of-alumni/?utm_term=.7b09df360de2">45 percent.</a> Surely one cannot believe that Brown’s admission policy vis-a-vis legacy applicants is so different from its peers without hard evidence to substantiate the claim. And if Brown is, in fact, using legacy status as more than a tie-breaker, it becomes patently obvious that non-legacy applicants, including applicants from low-income and first-generation backgrounds, are being pushed aside.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite the length of his piece, Powell devotes very little time to defending the use of legacy status in the admission process. The defenses he does provide are facile. For instance, he argues that legacy students are uniquely equipped to guide other students through their time at the University, yet he provides no evidence to substantiate this claim, beyond the sanguine assumptions that legacy students are exceptionally knowledgeable about Brown and eager to serve as community mentors. What’s more, Powell notes that legacy applicants generally support the University’s financial priorities. According to several studies, this is generally not the case. In the book “Affirmative Action for the Rich,” contributor Chad Coffman notes that among several universities that dropped their legacy preference policies, there was consequently negligible fluctuation in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Affirmative-Action-Rich-Preferences-Admissions/dp/0870785192">alum donations.</a></p>
<p class="p2">In the ultimate analysis, using legacy status in the admission process is wrong for two reasons. Firstly, it is profoundly unmeritocratic. While policies that seek to increase access for underrepresented groups are valuable to the extent that they allow talented and deserving students to compete in a system that is generally biased against them, considering legacy status in admission gives additional advantages to applicants that often already had substantial advantages to begin with. But secondly, and perhaps most importantly, in defending the use of legacy status in the admission process, Powell and the University are undermining the very goal of access that they claim to value. This is not to question the University’s good-faith commitment to expanding access to underrepresented communities. But if we, as a community, want to cast off the legacy of elitism that is pervasive among top-tier universities and make our campus totally accessible to underrepresented groups, we must end legacy admission once and for all.</p>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: MLB’s baserunner rule is ineffective and inorganic</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Besides an email from a Baseball Writers’ Association of America member angry at my criticisms of Hall of Fame voting procedures in<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/12/02/schapiro-19-hall-marty-nobles-automatics/"> December 2016</a>, my columns don’t usually generate many responses. So you can imagine how excited I was when I saw that Patrick Nugent ’21 had written an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/02/nugent-21-extra-inning-baserunner-rule-does-not-hurt-baseball/">op-ed</a> in response to my last <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/01/schapiro-19-rob-manfred-crosses-rubicon/">column</a>, in which I criticized Minor League Baseball’s use of a new rule to automatically place runners on base after the 10th inning.</p>
<p class="p2">“The idea that the rule doesn’t address a problem is wrong — it just doesn’t address the problem you think it does,” Nugent argues. The real problem the rule addresses, he writes, is that decreased starting pitcher workload has led to increased fatigue and injury among relief pitchers, whose increased value in recent years has made these kinds of injuries more costly to their teams.</p>
<p class="p2">But I would urge readers to remember: Just because this rule would reduce injuries to relief pitchers does not mean it is a good way to do so. Lots of rules would accomplish this goal but would also be clearly ridiculous, like requiring all relievers to wear Kevlar body armor or pitch from behind a safety net. So, is this particular rule worth it?</p>
<p class="p2">You already know my view, which is that it is not. There are all kinds of ways that MLB could protect relief pitchers without giving out free baserunners. It could expand rosters from 25 players to 28, allowing space for up to three more relief pitchers to dilute heavy workloads. It could direct increased funding to biomechanical studies and technology, which could allow teams to more effectively evaluate the causes of injuries to pitchers. It could mandate moving outfield fences back, resulting in fewer home runs, more outs and quicker innings, or it could slightly deaden baseballs — making them less firm so they don’t come off the bat as hard — with similar results. All of these things could be done effectively — and all, I’d say, would be far less disruptive and nonsensical than just giving out free runners.</p>
<p class="p2">Nugent then argues that the proposed rule would incentivize small ball, which, given the increased home run frequency across baseball, is an outcome I would also support. I love small ball — a well-executed suicide squeeze is my favorite play in baseball. But a rule change like this is not the way to bring it back. How do you incentivize small ball? In the ways described above: Make it harder to hit home runs, so that swinging for the fences is less likely to pay off. Small ball has declined because MLB teams have realized that power is more valuable than contact and that flyballs are more valuable than grounders. Unless flyballs become less valuable, the current trends toward more power and less small ball will continue. “Hitters, armed with better and more extensive data than ever,” the Washington Post reported last year, are “reaching the conclusion that not only are flyballs, on average, better than grounders but that the latter are to be avoided<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/sports/mlb-launch-angles-story/?utm_term=.463c7e7dca14"> at all costs.”</a> The Post quoted 2015 American League MVP Josh Donaldson: “Groundballs are outs. If you see me hit a groundball, even if it’s a hit, I can tell you: It was an accident.”</p>
<p class="p2">Hitters have systematically adjusted their swings away from small ball and toward power-hitting, regardless of game situation. And you can’t undo such an adjustment simply by putting free runners on base in extra innings. I love a good bunt more than anything — but when Joey Gallo, or one of the many players like him, comes to bat, it’s easy to tell that he’s swinging for the fences whether there’s a man on second or not.</p>
<p class="p2">“Baseball is steeped in tradition, but perhaps its most pervasive tradition is change,” Nugent then argues. As examples, he cites the five-man rotation, increased defensive shifts and the designated hitter. But it’s interesting — two of these, the five-man rotation and the defensive shift, didn’t come about through rule changes. They came from natural adaptation as teams fought to gain advantages on the field. The other example, the designated hitter — the only one listed that was an official rule change — is, like giving out free baserunners, something I heartily<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/16/schapiro-19-designated-hitter-overdue-retirement/"> disagree with.</a> And baseball fans agree with me: A 2016 poll conducted by Public Policy Polling found that 65 percent of respondents favored pitchers hitting over designated hitters, while 25 percent stated <a href="https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PPP_Release_National_51216.pdf">the opposite.</a> Certainly, baseball is always changing. And the best changes are those made by the teams on the field, not the lawyers in the commissioner’s office.</p>
<p class="p2">Like I’ve said, in the end, this is a philosophical question. I don’t support putting runners on base in extra innings because it would distort a fundamental part of baseball — the process of scoring a run — for purposes that could either be better achieved in other ways (like decreasing pitcher fatigue) or shouldn’t be achieved at all (increasing pace-of-play). To merit a change as radical as this, MLB needs to show both that it is in pursuit of objectives that are essential and that such a proposal is the best or only way to achieve them. And as far as free runners on second base go, so far, MLB has shown neither.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A recent University study published in Nature will open doors for antibiotics research by addressing an increasingly relevant crisis — the existence of superbugs, a term to describe antibiotic-resistant bacteria and infections caused by the prevalent MRSA bacterial strains. Researchers identified two compounds that could potentially kill the drug-resistant bacteria. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">MRSA cells are deemed “persisters” because they are responsible for chronic infection, said Wooseong Kim, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral researcher at the Alpert Medical School and the Rhode Island Hospital. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">MRSA infections can be acquired when patients are admitted to the intensive care unit or other hospital wards, wrote Eleftherios Mylonakis, professor of infectious disease, in an email to The Herald, adding that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deemed them a “serious threat.” According to the CDC’s website, two in 100 people carry MRSA.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These chronic infections put patients in “a very challenging position,” as they must continually seek treatment. With traditional antibiotics, the infection enters a dormant stage before eventually reanimating, said Beth Fuchs, co-author of the study. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study, which began in 2010, involved a series of experiments on C. elegans, a type of nematode worm. The researchers identified 185 compounds that decreased MRSA’s ability to kill the worms, Mylonakis wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The researchers then selected two well-studied compounds from the list of 185 to further investigate. The compounds were both retinoids, which target the lipid bi-layer of the cell membrane. In contrast, traditional antibiotics work to disrupt bacteria’s metabolic processes. The compounds’ different method of attacking the bacteria proved essential for treating MRSA-based infections and their persister cells. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beyond the study of these compounds, the research identified a target through which the persister cells could be attacked. The authors believe that this target could be used for new drugs and future research on MRSA-killing compounds, Fuchs said. In order to reach the stage of drug development, researchers will have to investigate the compounds for patient safety and comply with Food and Drug Agency tests, Fuchs added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study brought together a team of scientists across multiple disciplines. “We worked together with medicinal chemists, geneticists, engineers and computer scientists,” Mylonakis wrote, explaining that this multidisciplinary effort enabled the group to understand the action through which the retinoids functioned. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Julian Hurdle, associate professor of microbiology at Texas A&amp;M University, who is unaffiliated with the study, confirmed that the discovery of the compounds “is very promising.” But given the “number of parameters that have to be met” in the clinical setting, the notion that the compounds could become a pragmatic treatment for MRSA is “a hope, but not a guarantee,” Hurdle said. He added that the technology and methods employed for this study provide the opportunity to uncover more molecules and optimize them for antimicrobial purposes.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It was announced recently that the University intends to have former Florida Governor Jeb Bush come to campus to deliver the Stephen A. Ogden Jr. ’60 Memorial Lecture on International Affairs. This decision is disappointing, to say the least. The stated goal of the lecture is, according to the lecture’s <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/04/bush">website</a>, “the advancement of international peace and understanding.” Unfortunately, Bush’s views are not those of peace and understanding. Instead, he represents the exact divides in our world that lead to international conflict.</p>
<p class="p2">Jeb Bush has consistently chosen to advocate for policies that do not, and should not, represent the values of Brown students. Bush has vocally opposed allowing non-straight marriage, as well as the adoption of children by non-straight couples. These are morally unjustifiable positions. Furthermore, Bush has consistently advocated that women be denied their right to access reproductive health care, including abortions. These positions dehumanize, shame and disrespect members of the Brown community and the population at large. Individuals of moral character do not hold these indefensible positions.</p>
<p class="p2">By inviting Bush to deliver a prestigious lecture, the University implicitly suggests that holding morally unjustifiable and outrageous views about women and members of the LGBTQ+ community is not disqualifying of distinction, when in fact it should be. Providing Bush a platform suggests that his views, including his bigotry, deserve the same attention as rational and tolerant views. This should not be the case. It is downright insulting to the members of the Brown community who Bush has dehumanized that he be given the honor of delivering The Stephen A. Ogden Jr. ‘60 Memorial Lecture on International Affairs.</p>
<p class="p2">Even if one were to ignore Bush’s outrageous views, there is simply no reason to believe he has credible opinions on policy. Not only does Bush hold abhorrent views on social matters, but he has also refused to accept the facts surrounding climate change. Bush, in a 2011 interview, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/121580/jeb-bush-talks-about-climate-change-and-carbon-new-hampshire.">misleadingly stated</a>: “It is not unanimous among scientists that (climate change) is disproportionately manmade.” (While it is true that not every single climate scientist has thrown their weight behind this fact, the vast majority have.) Climate change is a serious matter, and the livelihoods of future generations depend on our ability to recognize and combat the serious harms being done to our planet. Someone who will mislead the public about the facts surrounding the climate, for example, should not be treated as a credible source of information on other subjects either. Despite these issues with his credibility, the University believes he is fit to deliver a prestigious lecture.</p>
<p class="p2">Furthermore, given that the topic of the lecture that Bush has been invited to deliver is international affairs, it might seem reasonable to believe that Bush has at least has some relevant experiences in this field. Unfortunately, Bush fails again. For instance, in 2015, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/15/jeb-bush-iraq-war-ivy-zietrich-isis-george-w-bush">stated</a> that, if he had been president in 2003, he would have authorized the invasion of Iraq given the information available. In light of the developments of the past decade, this position seems unthinkable. Bush’s policy positions notwithstanding, his qualifications in the field of international affairs are modest at best. Bush has never held a federal diplomatic office, and though he has engaged in some foreign diplomacy as Governor of Florida, it is unclear what warrants awarding him a prestigious lecture in this field.</p>
<p class="p2">And, let it be clear that the opposition to Jeb Bush speaking on Brown’s campus does not come from some desire to end freedom of speech. Bush certainly has every right to state his own views, and Brown has every right to invite him to speak. However, freedom of speech does not guarantee any platform from which to speak. Nor does freedom of speech mean that we, as a community, must blindly accept the legitimacy of any views presented to us. Furthermore, the opposition to Bush speaking on Brown’s campus does not come out of fear of ideological diversity. Brown ought to welcome those with dissenting views on policy issues. However, Bush’s views are unjustifiable, dehumanizing and rooted in ignorance, and the Brown community should not lend them legitimacy by inviting him to speak. There is a meaningful difference, for example, between legitimately believing that the free market is the best mechanism to confront climate change and denying the basic facts surrounding climate change. One of these positions is a legitimate, if controversial, policy opinion. One is not.</p>
<p class="p2">If Brown wants to encourage debate and discussion on campus, I, by all means, encourage them to find a speaker whose views might challenge those of students. However, when we allow speakers that dehumanize others to find a platform on our campus, we only act to silence those who have been dehumanized. I will gladly listen to any speaker who wants to make a case for a foreign policy doctrine with which I do not agree. What I will not do, however, is listen to someone who fails to recognize the humanity of my family, friends and peers. I strongly encourage the University administration to reconsider their decision to invite Jeb Bush to speak on campus. Furthermore, I strongly encourage them to invite a different speaker, one who has earned the privilege of addressing Brown students, and who represents the values that the University claims to support.</p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Who will win the NBA tank race?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The NBA playoffs are fast approaching, with anticipation growing accordingly. Sports fans cannot wait to find out if Stephen Curry can return healthy, if the Rockets can take down the Warriors and if LeBron James can make yet another NBA Finals appearance. But lost in all the playoff excitement is the closest race in the NBA, one that could have enormous ramifications for the future of the league: the race for last place.</p>
<p class="p2">The NBA’s lottery reform measures will begin next season, so for one last time, teams can secure the best possible lottery odds by obtaining bottom positions in the league standings. There are five prospects: DeAndre Ayton, Luka Dončić, Mohamed Bamba, Marvin Bagley III and Michael Porter Jr., who are all considered superstar potential, a talent pool that has led many organizations to take drastic steps for worsening their teams.</p>
<p class="p2">There are currently nine franchises vying for position, including a fascinating mixture of historic basement-dwellers and powerhouses: the Phoenix Suns, Memphis Grizzlies, Atlanta Hawks, Orlando Magic, Dallas Mavericks, Sacramento Kings, Brooklyn Nets, New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls. To be fair, the Nets are not tanking, since they do not control their first-round pick this year (still due to the Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett trade, incredibly). But the roster simply cannot win many games even when giving full effort.</p>
<p class="p2">The Suns, Grizzlies and Hawks have emerged as the worst of the worst, leaving the other teams to finish behind them in the lottery. Phoenix has a putrid 20-59 record, outpacing the 21-57 Grizzlies and 22-57 Hawks. The Suns have to be the favorites to come in last. Devin Booker, the team’s best player by a long shot, is sidelined with a hand injury, leaving rookie Josh Jackson to lead the rest of the bunch. Forward T.J. Warren can score, center Tyson Chandler can rebound and Jackson can do a little bit of everything on offense and defense. Besides them, however, the Suns have few average-level NBA players. Elfrid Payton, their point guard, cannot shoot in part because his long, pointed hair gets in the way of his arm and the ball (yes, this is real). Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss are already busts. The Suns surprisingly won their last outing against the Kings, breaking a 15-game losing streak, but it is safe to say that they will not enjoy much success from here on out.</p>
<p class="p2">The Hawks, in my opinion, could slide past the Grizzlies into second-worst place. Memphis has winnable games left against Sacramento and Detroit, but the Hawks face playoff teams for the rest of the season — in other words, sure losses. Atlanta’s top player, Dennis Schröder, is out with an ankle sprain for the rest of the season, forcing Taurean Prince, Kent Bazemore and rookie John Collins to step up. Unfortunately for the Hawks, Prince has shown that he can be explosive in scoring, with a pair of 38-point games last month. Atlanta may consider benching him if he plays too well on the court.</p>
<p class="p2">As mentioned above, Memphis has an easier schedule to end the season, which could spell trouble for their losing hopes. The Grizzlies boast the best player out of the NBA’s bottom three teams in center Marc Gasol. The 33-year-old can win a regular season game on his own, so Memphis has been reducing his playing time to stop that from happening. Gasol has not played more than 23 minutes in any of his last three games. Tyreke Evans is not playing either, as Memphis is perhaps the team most overtly tanking. But they cannot change their schedule, which could be their downfall.</p>
<p class="p2">While the bottom three teams have separated themselves, there is still plenty of competition for the other top lottery spots. The Dallas Mavericks pulled off an impressive loss against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night that helped their place tremendously. With Harrison Barnes (rest), Dennis Smith Jr. (knee) and Dirk Nowitzki (ankle) all off the court, the Mavs showed their commitment to the tank and have set themselves up for the fourth pick. Orlando must shake off their win and find a better way to limit the impact of Aaron Gordon. They should still finish in the top five, however. The Sacramento Kings have two clutch performers in De’Aaron Fox and Bogdan Bogdanović. But they’ve proven to be clutch a season too early and could cost the Kings’ position against the Nets. Brooklyn boasts some talent but falls apart at the end of close games. Chicago and New York, meanwhile, stand firmly above the rest of the tankers.</p>
<p class="p2">The next week could decide the future of the league, though no one will be winning a championship, a playoff series or even two games. But with nine teams all trying their hardest to lose, at the very least, it will be an interesting travesty to watch unfold.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">With the buzzword “data-driven” gaining traction as a hot topic within many disciplines today, researchers and students flocked to the Serre Lab’s workshop on deep learning and the field’s myriad applications last Saturday.</p>
<p class="p4">Deep learning is a set of algorithms that analyzes a large amount of data to improve specific processes under study. The workshop, “Beyond Deep Learning,” is part of a lecture series that aims to bring together cognitive science and computer science to present new ways for approaching artificial intelligence and its plethora of applications.</p>
<p class="p4">Tom Griffiths, professor of psychology and cognitive science at Princeton, Dima Amso, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and David Heeger, professor of psychology and neural sciences at New York University, spoke Friday afternoon about recent advancements in mapping biological human intelligence to create computational models for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class="p4">Heeger focuses on a few different fields: working memory from cognitive psychology, computer science algorithms and their<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>overall connection to neurobiology.</p>
<p class="p4">“Working memory is a cognitive process that is responsible for both maintaining and manipulating information over time,” Heeger said. Working memory requires combining information encountered in the present with past memory and experiences, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">On the other hand, computers do not have an unlimited amount of memory to store information, Heeger said. “The concept is that you have a state that you update over time, and you carry forward some information and throw away some information and transform some information,” he added. This constraint makes it difficult for researchers to model working memory, since working memory necessitates access to past experiences that computers may have overwritten.</p>
<p class="p4">In contrast to working memory, “psychologists use the term ‘short-term’ memory just to refer to maintenance of information over time” but not the manipulation of such information, Heeger said.</p>
<p class="p4">In recent years, researchers have begun to use an algorithm called a Long-Short Term Memory network to manipulate information. Such manipulation more closely resembles the processes involved in working memory as opposed to short-term memory.</p>
<p class="p4">LSTMs are “simple algorithms that can solve seemingly complicated tasks,” Heeger said. Such tasks can include language modeling and eye movement tracking.</p>
<p class="p4">Essentially, eye movement requires that the brain manipulate information on a coordinate basis — a process that researchers now track with LSTM algorithms, Heeger said. “Working memory and other kinds of executive function such as attention may depend on the same computational engine as motor preparation, motor control and sensory processing,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Griffiths took the podium to discuss using computer science to create predictions about human behavior. Researchers hope to explain how we interpret information in the world from natural stimuli that are faced everyday and not just simplistic stimuli, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Griffiths uses computer science to study an individual’s psychological visualization of an image rather than the activity of neurons.</p>
<p class="p4">The issue is that these representations “are not really things you can see or touch. We have to rely on behavior to tell us about what some of those underlying representations might be,” Griffiths said. While machine learning sheds light on behavior prediction, it raises the challenge of explaining that behavior, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">“In reality, there are a lot of complex stimuli that humans face, so it’s important for computers to be able to analyze this vast amount of information and model how humans classify their information in order to interpret it,”
Griffiths said. Researchers can then model the behavior and decisions that people make and “predict peoples’ classification behavior very well,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">This empirical treatment of psychology is unusual because the subject is normally studied with theoretical models, Griffiths said. Now, researchers can look at inputs and data facilitated by computational methods in order to make predictions about behavior, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">“We sort of passed the threshold where hand-engineered models had more bias (than the deep learning models),” Griffiths said.</p>
<p class="p4">While Griffiths’ work uses computational methods to understand human behavior, Amso’s research is focused on how we can use human behavior, especially in the case of infants, to inform computer science.</p>
<p class="p4">There is a high amount of complexity in human-infant interactions, not only in the baby’s actions, but also in the data the baby is receiving, Amso said. Information enters the system through the senses first and then enters the brain, she added. “This gives me a framework (from which) to ask my questions so that I don’t ask my questions in a way that is inconsistent with the biology of the system,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Researchers must take into account how the visual system is developed. To address this, researchers use eye trackers to monitor where a baby is looking in order to see if the baby is observing the whole image and actually understanding what is happening, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">But “the data depend on the state of the visual system … and the full visual field is not sufficient” to determine what the baby is actually understanding and viewing in the world. Tactile information is necessary for babies to actually get an idea of the 3-D shape of objects and the world around them.</p>
<p class="p4">“I think (this series) does a good job bringing together the psychology department at Brown, which has a strong computational history, and the strong computer science department,” Harrison Ritz GS said.</p>
<p class="p4">“I always think it is pretty cool to see the intersection of neuroscience and computer science, as someone who works in machine learning,” Dan Shiebler ’15 said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brown alum to fight domestic violence at national level</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The National Network to End Domestic Violence has hired Deborah DeBare ’83 as its new senior deputy director. She has served as the executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence for 23 years. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">DeBare began helping domestic violence survivors as a senior at the University through Sojourner House, a nonprofit that supports those who have experienced domestic and sexual abuse. While volunteering, DeBare worked with survivors to figure out the safest, most promising path forward. When she was a student, she joined the political action group FIRE, which raised awareness about violence against women. As part of FIRE, her work included informing the public about rape allegations against former Providence mayor Buddy Cianci, for which he was never prosecuted. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Confidentiality was key in FIRE’s Cianci campaign, as among other initiatives.“We printed off these very official looking signs and posted them all over the city that said ‘Curfew has been implemented in the city of Providence, no women are allowed out after 9 p.m. It is not safe to walk the streets with an alleged rapist as mayor,’” DeBare said. “We were very much a stealth group, we kept our names out because we were all afraid of getting kicked out of school.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Today, DeBare continues to fight against the pervasiveness of domestic violence nationwide, which has not significantly improved since her time at the University.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We haven’t really seen the prevalence rates drop,” DeBare said. “We still see research that shows one in four women will experience intimate partner violence at some point in her life.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To combat this reality, DeBare has slowly but surely expanded efforts to prevent domestic violence from spreading. For example, RICADV was involved in the implementation of neighborhood cookouts and movie nights in Newport to build “community cohesion” because a stronger community, in theory, means neighbors are more likely to take action upon hearing about domestic violence in nearby households, DeBare said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">DeBare has also focused on maintaining the emergency and support services offered by RICADV’s five member organizations, which include Sojourner House and Blackstone Valley Advocacy Group.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In her new position at NNEDV, which will expand her reach from Rhode Island to the nation, DeBare will be working with different state coalitions against domestic violence to capitalize on the strengths and overcome the weaknesses of each state’s program. For example, DeBare praised the state of Kansas for having a unified message that combines sexual assault and domestic violence prevention; but she also stressed that the rural nature of Kansas makes communication between the state’s programs difficult.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">DeBare brings experience in building functional coalitions to address program weaknesses in states like Kansas. Under her leadership, RICADV grew from three to 12 staff members, while staying financially stable.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“I’m really proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish in Rhode Island,” said Jennifer Meade, president of the RICADV board of directors. “I think other coalitions across the country are going to be able to learn from that.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Meade and Linda Impagliazzo, executive director of Blackstone Valley Advocacy Center, agreed that DeBare’s success as a leader of the RICADV came from her commitment to helping victims of domestic violence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“If there’s ever times when she gets approached and someone says, ‘Well, have you thought about doing this,’ she will go back and say … ‘Is this part of what we have purposely set out to do?’” Meade said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Impagliazzo believ</span><span class="s3">es DeBare’s success can also be attributed to her ability to meet each agency’s needs in a fair way, while always putting victims of domestic violence first.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">DeBare sees working at NNEDV as the next step toward shifting national values to create a more equitable and just world for women — a process that has been slower than she anticipated while at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“My goal is to see the next generation of kids — boys and girls — growing up where they have a sense of expectation … that their relationship will be healthy and supportive,” DeBare said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Coming off a spring break victory over the University of California, Davis, the men’s tennis team returned to the Pizzitola Sports Center Friday for its first Ivy League test of the season. Bruno (14-7, 0-2 Ivy) kept a close match against Harvard (19-3, 3-0) but ultimately fell to the Crimson 4-3 after the visitors were able to clinch the winning point in fifth singles. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a pretty good showing considering last year’s results,” said Charles Tan ’19. “We had a really good chance, and it just kind of slipped away from us in the end.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The momentum initially swung in Harvard’s favor as the Crimson downed the Bears in first and third doubles to snag the first point of the day. But Brown showed no signs of surrender during singles play and evened the score to 1-1 after Charles Tan ’19 notched a 6-2, 6-3 victory in the fourth singles slot. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jack Haworth ’18 put up a fight in first singles and nearly pulled off a comeback with a 6-4 win in the second set to force a third before Harvard’s Kenny Tao sealed the final set to put the Crimson back on top. Peter Tarwid ’18 recorded a 6-4, 7-3 victory in third singles to tie the match for the second time, but Harvard came away with wins in second and fifth singles to bring up the final 4-3 score.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fifty-three miles away, the women’s tennis team was also trying to hold off the Crimson as the Bears (9-10, 2-1) hoped to keep a pristine conference record after they opened Ivy play with a spring break victory over Yale. But Harvard (11-8, 3-0) showcased strength and depth in singles play, sweeping five of the six matches to nab the 5-2 victory. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a pretty tough match,” said Devon Jack ’20. “Harvard has been pretty good the past two years, so we knew it was going to be a difficult match going in. … It just wasn’t our day.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno started off strong with doubles performances to take an early lead. Courtney Kowalsky ’21 teamed up with Maddie Stearns ’18 to defeat the Crimson 6-4 in the first spot while Juliana Simon ’20 and Katie Ta ’19 supported with a 6-2 win in third doubles to seal the point. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were really pumped (because) it had been a while since we won a doubles point that way,” Jack said. “All three teams fought hard and played really well. … We were trying to take that energy and adrenaline into our singles matches, but they stayed tough.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jack claimed the Bears’ lone win in singles with a 6-2, 6-1 win in the third slot, but three Bears forced their matches into extra sets. Alyza Benotto ’18, Stearns and Simon all pushed their opponents to a third set, but Harvard held on to win first, second and sixth singles matches en route to the 5-2 final score. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our team responded as well as we could have responded to a loss like that,” Jack said. “Losing to Harvard is tough because it’s Harvard and because we don’t have an Ivy League tournament or a conference tournament … so every match that we play throughout the month is extremely important because you don’t get a second chance. After that loss, we were devastated. But we responded really well to it.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both teams will be back in action next weekend against Penn. The women will return home to host the Quakers while the men will travel to Philadelphia for a chance to improve their records.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The baseball team earned its second shutout victory of the season with a 12-0 win over Princeton Sunday, after dropping two contests of a three-game series to the Tigers Saturday. With this weekend’s results, Brown (7-15, 3-6 Ivy) moves to seventh place in conference standings.</p>
<p class="p4">“Saturday, we faced two pretty good arms,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles. “We just obviously didn’t do enough offensively. We struck out 23 times in two games, (which) is not a recipe for offense by any stretch. (Sunday), we talked about coming out and not letting our circumstances dictate how we feel, but letting how we feel dictate our play.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Brown 4, Princeton 7</b></p>
<p class="p4">In the series opener, the Bears were resilient against the Tigers (7-13, 4-2) and stayed competitive to keep the game close. In the top of the sixth, Princeton jumped out to a 4-1 lead, but Brown responded in the bottom of the inning to tie the score. Second baseman Joe Lomuscio ’21 posted an RBI double, and designated hitter Calvin Farris ’20 knocked in two runs on a single for the equalizer.</p>
<p class="p4">The two Ivy League rivals entered the ninth tied at four, but the Tigers exploded for a three-run inning to down the Bears. Bruno notched seven hits compared to Princeton’s 11 and recorded one error.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Brown 3, Princeton 4</b></p>
<p class="p4">Later in the afternoon, Brown was again narrowly defeated by Princeton. Similarly to the previous game, the Tigers jumped out to another 4-1 advantage and earned a three-run lead in the top of the seventh frame. The Bears were able to put three men on base in the next half-inning, and Lomuscio and shortstop Willy Homza ’19 each recorded RBIs on sacrifice flies to bring the Bears to within one.</p>
<p class="p4">Brown could not complete the comeback in the final two innings, as Princeton’s effective relief pitching silenced the Bears’ bats. Bruno finished the game with seven hits, and starting pitcher Will Tomlinson ’20 struck out seven batters over 5.1 innings.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Brown 12, Princeton 0</b></p>
<p class="p4">The following day, Bruno came out of the dugout hot and did not cool down all afternoon. The Bears knocked in three runs in the bottom of the second to start the offensive barrage. Right fielder Hunter Carey ’18 recorded an RBI on a fielder’s choice sending third baseman Cameron Deere ’20 running across home plate. Homza then plated Farris to cross home with a powerful RBI double to widen the lead. Lomuscio capped off an impressive series and notched an RBI single into the center field gap for the third time in as many games.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’ve shown at times throughout the course of this spring that we’ve really been able to hit and play solid offense,” Achilles said.</p>
<p class="p4">In the bottom of the fifth, second baseman Rich Ciufo ’20, catcher Parke Phillips ’20 and starting pitcher Garett Delano ’20 loaded the bases with no outs. Deere then rocketed a grand slam into deep center field that sent the Brown dugout into a frenzy and gave the Bears an 8-0 lead.</p>
<p class="p4">“We needed a momentum swing right there,” Deere said. “We had been in that situation before and hadn’t gotten that big hit, and it has led to us ending up on the wrong side of the scoreboard later on.”</p>
<p class="p4">Moments later, Carey launched another home run to deep right field to bring home first baseman Mark Sluys ’19 and extend Bruno’s lead to ten runs.</p>
<p class="p4">Defensively, the Bears were sharp all day. In the top of the sixth, the Tigers had runners on first and third with one out, but Brown executed a perfect double play to preserve the shutout. Delano stifled Princeton’s offense throughout the contest and pitched six shutout innings with no errors to earn four strikeouts and help secure the victory.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’ve lost a lot in a row, so it feels good to execute pitches and give my team a chance to win,” Delano said. “Pitching with a lead sometimes gets tough because you don’t execute as you would in a tight ballgame. But it definitely felt good. We had twelve runs today, so it definitely took the pressure off.”</p>
<p class="p4">Sluys launched another home run in the seventh, and Phillips sent Lomuscio home with an RBI in the eighth to deliver Brown’s final two runs of the game.</p>
<p class="p4">“Our guys really came out and played well today,” Achilles said. “We were able to put together a good offensive day with some defense and a great start by (Delano).”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears will host interstate rival the University of Rhode Island Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. before playing another three-game series against Columbia this weekend at Murray Stadium.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Entering the weekend, the women’s lacrosse team hoped to secure its first Ivy League victory of the season against a No. 23 ranked Cornell team. The Bears (8-4, 1-3 Ivy) did just that, as a second-half comeback proved enough to down Cornell (6-5, 2-2 Ivy) in a nail-biter finish. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There was a lot of emotion and hype surrounding this game,” said Bri Irons ’18.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But the biggest thing going into (Saturday) was us focusing on Brown lacrosse … just really focusing on trusting each other, trusting our system.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown’s offense got off to a fast start, and opened scoring with back-to-back goals by first-year phenoms Risa Mosenthal ’21 and Maggie Fowler ’21 in the first three minutes of play. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cornell responded with a goal about two minutes later, which Emma Dahle ’18 answered to lengthen the Bears’ lead. Another point from Cornell set the game at 3-2 in favor of Brown with just under 22 minutes remaining in the first half. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next four goals were a Paletta family affair. Bruno earned the first point off a goal from Carolyn Paletta ’18,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>while the next two were scored by Carolyn’s sister and Big Red freshman, Grace Paletta. Not to be outmatched, Brown’s Paletta scored once more with 13:50 remaining in the period.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mosenthal found the back of the net under a minute later with her second goal of the game and gave the Bears a two-point lead. But Cornell trimmed the advantage by one with just over two minutes remaining in the frame.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A goal scored by Cornell with one second left in the period sent the teams into halftime at a 6-6 draw. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cornell controlled the first five minutes of the second half, and mounted a three-goal run to set the game at 9-6. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fowler responded for Bruno with a tally 30 seconds later. Paletta quickly followed, placing the Bears within one goal of the Big Red. But Cornell’s offense began to rally and scored four unanswered goals in about as many minutes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, Bruno found a way to bounce back in the final 18 minutes of the contest. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In the second half, we switched our defensive set to a zone, which was a really big (change), and (Cornell) didn’t score for 18 minutes. Mikaela Karlsson (’18) coming in and having five saves … those were super important for us,” Irons said. “You could tell we had this new confidence that I saw on the field. Even when we were down by five, we didn’t look like we were playing nervous.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Karlsson entered the contest with 18:37 remaining in the second half and proceeded to save all five shots that came her way for the rest of the game. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Bears’ offense found a rhythm after a goal from Zoe Verni ’19 with just under 17 minutes remaining. Paletta followed eight seconds later with a point, her team-leading fourth goal of the afternoon, and set the game at 13-10. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Emma DeGennaro ’20 and Caroline Zaffino ’19 followed with their first goals of the contest, and made it a one-point game with just under eight minutes left to play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Strong team defensive play continued to give the Bears’ offense opportunities to attack the goal. Verni tied the game at 13 apiece with 3:55 remaining, and Brown took the lead off a goal from Zaffino at the 2:18 mark.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Forcing a shot clock violation on Cornell, Bruno’s defense held on for the remainder of the game and secured Brown’s eighth win of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Overcoming a six-point deficit served as a testament to the team’s unity and composure, Mosenthal stated. “(We) dug deep and realized we had to take care of the ball and make sure we were protecting our defense with goals,” Mosenthal said. “It was … a full team effort — everyone really stepped it up at the end to secure the win.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mosenthal’s two goals on the afternoon extended her season total to a team-high 44. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Head Coach Keely McDonald ’00 also highlighted the team’s cohesion. “They stayed positive the whole time, really stayed centered (and) believed in themselves,” McDonald said after the game.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think it was just individual effort by each player to stay composed and stick with the game plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears finish the month of April with three more Ivy League games, with the next coming this weekend at Harvard. The team hopes to build on Saturday’s momentum going forward.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(We) definitely want to focus on playing at our standard and playing how we know we can, which we proved on Saturday against Cornell,” Mosenthal said. “I think we just need to focus on continuing to play at that level, and if we can do that we’ll definitely find success.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A distinctive combination of visual metaphors, color and depth underlies the “Silenced Voices” exhibition, which is currently on display at The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. The exhibition features the work of Cuban-born artist, Raphael Díaz, who explores elements that are both universal and autobiographical, such as migration and the fragility of life. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(Díaz’s work) talks about migration and displacement, (which) are very important themes of intellectual inquiry at the Watson Institute,” said Steven Bloomfield, associate director of the Watson Institute. “There are people suffering all over the world; there are refugees all over the world; there are people crossing borders. … We have a scholarly and a policy interest in those displacements,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The theme of migration in Díaz’s artwork is inspired by his personal experience immigrating to the United States. “I came to the U.S. (when) I was 3 years old, when my mother left Cuba,” Díaz said, emphasizing that leaving Cuba was not his choice. “My work talks about my personal experiences, but also (relates to the experiences) of so many other people,” he said in reference to the DACA recipients and refugees in Europe. “I am a reflection of my society,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Díaz’s paintings are accentuated by varied and bright colors, “upon looking more deeply, one sees anguish and frustration,” Bloomfield said. “What one sees in the paintings are the faces of many people who are … seeking an opportunity to express their voices … (which) don’t seem to be appreciated and (are) in the process of being suppressed.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“‘Silenced Voices’ are about those people who cannot talk,” Díaz explained. “They don’t have a voice, and I would like my art to be a voice for them,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The recurring motifs in Díaz’s work are unmistakably idiosyncratic. For instance, the focus of each painting is a surreal, angel-like figure, with wings made of plantains. “It’s a self-portrait,” Díaz explained. “When I was younger, my mother used to send me to buy plantains” because they were unable to afford more exotic varieties of fruits. “The other children used to make fun of me and call me ‘the plantain boy.’” Rather than succumbing to their derision, Díaz chose to embrace this aspect of his identity by illustrating himself as a ‘plantain angel’ in each of his works. “They say ‘you are what you eat,’ so the plantain angel is me,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other distinctive elements of Díaz’s work include fragile boats and a black-and-white checkerboard. While at first glance, these motifs appear to be a melange of disparate elements, their symbolism is profound. For instance, the boat represents a form of transport for several migrants, Díaz explained, and added that it can also symbolize how people travel from one life into another after death. Meanwhile, the black-and-white checkerboard is a reminder to the viewer that “nothing in life is ever stable.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I definitely noticed the recurring motifs (in the paintings),” said Annie Lehman-Ludwig ’20, an art history concentrator. “The viewer can really look at (Díaz’s) work and see what the ‘silenced voices’ mean,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While migration is a prevalent theme of Díaz’s work, his art also addresses life and its ephemeral quality. “Life is so fragile and we take it for granted,” Díaz said. “As humans, we are always in a rush. We’re always moving from here and there and we never stop to reflect … I would like people to stop and look at my work and reflect,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Liang &#039;19: Inviting Jeb Bush to speak is responsible</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Michael Froid ’21 wrote an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/06/froid-21-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-irresponsible/">op-ed</a> published in The Herald on April 6 that argues against the University’s <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/05/jeb-bush-to-speak-as-ogden-lecturer-april-25/">decision</a> to invite Jeb Bush to give the Stephen A. Ogden Jr. ’60 Memorial Lecture on International Affairs. Froid’s op-ed is an excellent piece, and it makes this dissent especially difficult to put together. Both Froid and I disagree with nearly every one of Bush’s social, political and economical viewpoints.</p>
<p class="p2">But let me be blunt. Millions of Americans share Bush’s views, and ignoring this central fact is not helpful. <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/">Forty percent</a> of Americans believe abortion should be illegal. Thirty-three percent of Americans still <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/record-percentage-americans-support-gay-marriage-poll-finds-n799376">oppose</a> same-sex marriage. In sum, over a third of U.S. citizens believe in things Froid calls “morally unjustifiable.” This number is most likely way above the proportion of Brown students who also believe those things and is in no way aligned with my own ideals, but it is the reality of the country we live in. So I’m saddened to hear about the backlash against the University’s invitation to Jeb Bush to speak at Brown because inviting him is one of the most responsible things this University can do.</p>
<p class="p2">I don’t want speakers who perfectly “represent the values of Brown students,” as Froid writes, because these speakers aren’t students. They’re an educational opportunity. I want to learn how the other side of the aisle thinks. I want to know what it values, what it believes and what it prioritizes. The real world is a hodgepodge of ideas that can offend and humiliate. If we want to lower the percentages of Americans who support “morally unjustifiable” ideas, those who can have to learn about the viewpoints that make us angry and marginalized. We don’t have to elevate them or even agree with them, but we have to recognize that they are there and learn how to beat them.</p>
<p class="p2">Let’s stop pretending the controversy over Bush’s invitation is a question about qualifications. The Odgen lecture has hosted senators, CEOs and even a newspaper columnist. Having direct experience in the State Department or equivalent is obviously not a requisite. This backlash is a partisan one: Bush’s very association with the Republican Party causes shrieks all over campus. This reaction is not surprising: After all, it is 2018, and President Trump is in office. It’s interesting to me that students have not criticized the Ogden Lecture for its other invitees, such as the President of Colombia or the Ambassador of Iran to the United States — representatives of countries with human rights records that make Froid’s grievances against Bush pale in comparison.</p>
<p class="p2">Further, it isn’t meaningful to evaluate a politician’s policy agenda using the measure of morality. If I were asking Bush a question at this lecture, it wouldn’t be about how he justifies his “unjustifiable morals.” What sort of person would be able to answer that honestly? Rather, I’d ask him how his marriage views comply with the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment, because according to the Supreme Court, they don’t. I’d ask him about Roe vs. Wade and the multiple models of Florida flooding under rising sea waters. Froid writes, “Individuals of moral character do not hold these indefensible positions.” But “moral character” means different things to different people, based on their own philosophical interpretations — the same interpretations that let both the left and right call themselves righteous. Policy implications and the Constitution are more concrete than morality, and evaluating Bush’s positions against these definitive benchmarks by asking him questions, in person, is far more productive.</p>
<p class="p2">In a more immediate sense, refusing to invite conservative figures like Bush does not help Brown students express their own worldviews and refine their grasp of policy. When Froid writes that Bush’s views are “unjustifiable, dehumanizing and rooted in ignorance,” I am reminded of the time that administrators had to cut short an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/10/30/ray-kelly-lecture-canceled-amidst-student-community-protest/">event</a> with Raymond Kelly, the police commissioner who supported the stop-and-frisk policing policy that disproportionately affected people of color. We were gonna grill him to the end of the world, man! We were going to show him that we as students knew the statistics, facts and evidence that proved his policy agenda wrong and misguided. But students, of all political stripes, never had the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of criminal justice and even have a conversation. How can we prove to Americans that we have better ideas than conservatives if we don’t engage at all with conservative speakers who come to campus?</p>
<p class="p2">Here’s what I propose. Let Jeb Bush come. But the University should sponsor talks and workshops before and after the event that tackle why his ideas can marginalize communities, how progressive politics can win and how young liberals should interact with the American right. Instead of just calling his ideas “morally unjustifiable and outrageous,” let’s tell Bush why. Student groups should make safe spaces as they deem necessary, but also mobilize together to create the most impact on campus discourse — impact that I think is only possible if Bush comes to campus. Boycott the lecture, or go dressed in black shirts and dark shades, holding up signs that spell out “PLEASE CLAP.” But let Jeb Bush speak so we can hold him accountable for every word he says, or God knows he’ll just find another place to say whatever he wants with little opposition. Show him the strength of our conviction and the intelligence of our discourse — let’s show him who we are as a Brown community.</p>

<p class="p3">I read the beginning of Michael Froid’s ’21 Friday, April 6 op-ed “Inviting Jeb Bush to speak is irresponsible.” I admit to having a similar reaction when I heard that Jeb Bush was coming to campus.</p>
<p class="p3">Then I chastised myself.</p>
<p class="p3">A huge part of why this country’s politics are so messed up is because nobody wants to listen to “the other side.”</p>
<p class="p3">Do you really want to deny someone the right to speak because you don’t agree with what you presume he has to say? Is that the way this country will get out of the mess we’re in?</p>
<p class="p3">How can we hope to persuade someone to share our views if we refuse to meet them and listen to them and discuss issues? How can we hope they will listen to us?</p>
<p class="p3">I am disappointed because I really believe that college students are the people who will bring about change; but change will not be brought about by those who are closed-minded. It will be more of you not listening to them and them not listening to you.</p>

		<title>Gaur ’21 to compete on ‘Jeopardy!’</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Dhruv Gaur ’21 will appear on an episode of “Jeopardy!” College Championship tonight to represent the University. Gaur joins 14 other students from colleges across the United States to compete in the quiz competition for a $100,000 prize. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The process to participate in the competition began back in October, when Gaur completed an online quiz specifically for the college championship. While he never got his score, Gaur was later notified through email that he had qualified for the live audition, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A month after Gaur completed his live audition in Boston in November, he received a phone call congratulating him for making it onto the show. Producers sent him to Los Angeles in March to film the competition.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Gaur already knows the results of the competition, but he cannot disclose them before the competition airs. While in Los Angeles, the contestants spent two weeks filming the quarterfinals, semi-finals and the final round. “It goes really, really quickly,” Gaur said. “So you don’t really have time to really be super stressed — you’re just kind of going and then it’s over and you take a while to process it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Jeopardy!” has been a fixture in Gaur’s life since he was a kid. “It was always on in our house and I would answer questions along” with the show’s contestants, Gaur said. “One day, my dad was like, ‘You know, you’re pretty good at this, so you should give it a shot.’” While Gaur initially dismissed his dad’s comment, he later decided to try out, “and it turned out great,” Gaur added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Gaur, the college championship is more academic than standard “Jeopardy!” programming. There are fewer “random ‘70s pop culture questions, and it’s a lot of history, geography and science,” Gaur said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">In preparation for the competition, Gaur watched hundreds of old “Jeopardy!” episodes while also playing the game online against other people. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gaur’s friend Cameron Trupp ’21 supported him throughout the training process. Because a lot of Gaur’s preparation took place online, Trupp said he just offered “emotional support most of the time.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When we would study, he would take study breaks” alternating between schoolwork and “Jeopardy!” questions, Trupp said. “Sometimes I would have to encourage him to go back to schoolwork because he was getting a bit sucked into the “Jeopardy!” questions,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gaur is not the only Brown student to have a talent in trivia. Noah Cowan ’19 also <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/04/contestants-for-500-who-is-noah-cowan/">competed</a> on the “Jeopardy!” College Championship when he was a freshman. He and Gaur met to discuss the competition before Gaur left for filming. While Cowan didn’t win the $100,000 grand prize, “it was definitely a lot of fun and just like a funny thing to do freshman year, because I’m still known by some people as the ‘Jeopardy!’ kid,” Cowan said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If Gaur does win the grand prize, he plans to take his friends out for dinner and “save most of it,” using some to pay for tuition. “I don’t really have any concrete plans right now,” Gaur said. “I feel like I can probably do better things with the money later on when I actually know what I’m doing with my life.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University startup awarded first place at SXSW competition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Thomas Dickerson GS led his startup, Geopipe, to take first place at the Student Startup Madness competition in the SXSW Interactive conference in Austin, Texas, March 12. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Geopipe — which Dickerson co-founded with Christopher Mitchell, adjunct professor at New York University — creates virtual models of the real world, allowing urban designers and architects to visualize projects in the context of real urban landscapes. Geopipe can also be used in video game design and training simulations for first responders and the military, Mitchell said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Geopipe had all the components for winning,” said judge Abe Minkara, director of business development at Mark Cuban Companies. “They’ve already demonstrated that they have a unique algorithm that can be applied in many different types of industries. They also proved that they have momentum and they validated their product by already having customers. There are opportunities for other companies like Google to invest or possibly acquire them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dickerson and Mitchell entered the competition last year but only made it to the round of 64 teams, Dickerson said. They were invited back by SXSW this year. Before winning first place, the company reached the “Entrepreneurial Eight,” during which they presented their pitch and answered questions in front of a panel of four judges.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We were told by colleagues that (the competition and SXSW) as a whole were a great opportunity to raise visibility for the company and to connect with investors and, potentially, even partners and customers,” Mitchell said. “Because these are all among our immediate goals, entering the competition was an obvious choice for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dickerson added that though the competition did not offer a monetary prize, they were able to network and pitch to an “investor-heavy audience,” as well as publicize Geopipe on the SXSW stage. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Dickerson and Mitchell founded Geopipe in June 2016 during the NYU Summer Launchpad Program, an accelerator program for students with startups. The pair has been working on projects together since they met 15 years ago on an online forum for students learning to program, Dickerson said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before Geopipe’s inception, Mitchell was trying to map the landscape of New York City into Minecraft on a one-to-one scale, while Dickerson was trying to create models of real buildings in virtual Legos, Mitchell said. Together, they initially wanted to recreate the real world for video game designers to adopt and modify.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We pretty quickly realized that video game designers weren’t going to be the best early adopters for us,” Dickerson said. “Compared to architecture and urban design … video game designers just need a much higher level of realism and interactivity to be able to really make use of our product.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dickerson and Mitchell intend to continue building out their technical road maps, bringing on more members to the technical team and attracting more investors. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are excited about pursuing each of our current focuses for the company,” Mitchell said. “Accelerating product development makes it easier to get more beta customers on board, which makes attracting investment more tractable, which in turn helps us build the team to develop the company, sales and product.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In terms of the day-to-day operations, Dickerson has intentionally separated his academic research at the University from his work at Geopipe. However, he added that “Brown has been very useful for the social networking components, which come along with being part of a huge computer science program.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Panel covers uncertainty of temporary protected status</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Central American United Student Association organized a Temporary Protective Status Teach-In Panel Monday evening as a part of CAUSA’s inaugural Central American Series. Moderated by Andrea Flores, assistant professor of education, the panel featured prominent community organizers who were invited to address a variety of issues related to TPS, including comprehensive immigration reform and intersectional immigration advocacy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Created by the U.S. Congress in 1990, TPS is an immigration status that suspends the deportation of individuals from nations “destabilized by war or catastrophe,” as the Washington Post previously reported. The status, which lasts up to 18 months, provides foreign nationals with the ability to obtain “work authorization and a driver’s license,” according to the Post. The Trump administration announced in January its decision not to renew TPS for Salvadorans, the largest group of TPS holders.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">CAUSA chose to organize a teach-in on TPS because “our communities are being affected, they’re really struggling and we need to bring awareness to it,” said Maryori Conde ’18, who founded CAUSA in 2016. The lack of awareness on this issue extends even to lawmakers, she added. “When we call our Congress members, we always have to educate them on what TPS is because they never know what it is.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In today’s political climate, there is a need for a continued dialogue on this often overlooked issue, Conde said. “A couple of us went to the (Save TPS National) Conference, and when we got back, we tried to get members from CAUSA and members from (the Brown Immigrant Rights Coalition) to continue the conversation,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The invited panelists represented a diverse range of communities: Patrice Lawrence, the national policy and advocacy director for the UndocuBlack Network; Ninaj Raoul, the co-founder and community organizer at Haitian Women for Haitian Refugees; and Veronica Giron, a TPS-holder, activist and labor union representative. “Only one of the panelists is Central American, one is Jamaican and one is Haitian. … They’re all part of the TPS alliance,” Conde said, adding that TPS is a “Central American narrative, but it’s not just a Central American issue.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the event, the panelists stressed the importance of comprehensive immigration reform. Giron, who had Conde translate her words from Spanish into English, said that many TPS-holders seek security and certainty in the future of their immigration status. “It’s good to be grateful, but know that it’s temporary. That’s why they call it Temporary Protected Status,” Raoul said. People “get comfortable when they see that it’s extended over and over a few times,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raoul said the Trump administration’s recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/us/haitians-temporary-status.html">decision</a> to terminate TPS for Haitians made TPS holders realize “that it is important to start organizing for a more permanent solution.” </span></p>
<p class="p2">After TPS ends for a specific country, the “entire community will lose their protection,” Lawrence said. Community members will be unable to enter government buildings, health facilities and any locations requiring government identification for entrance.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The panelists also spoke about TPS from a humanitarian perspective, highlighting the uncertainty that families face from the program’s potential end. Because many families consist of members with different immigration statuses, the permanent termination of TPS would split them apart. “A lot of families are (of) mixed-status, and there are continuously attacks to that,” Lawrence said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The panel also discussed the importance of education and activism. Raoul said it is important that TPS holders are given the platform to speak on their circumstances. “In any movement, it has to be led by the people directly affected,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These “human voices” are necessary to educate the public and raise awareness, Raoul added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The panelists encouraged attendees to look within their immediate communities for solidarity and strength. Effective activism means understanding the events unfolding locally and starting from the bottom to work upwards, Giron said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Just let people feel comfortable enough to know that they can come to you, and they can talk to you. It will be a slow process, and you won’t see the results right away. But it makes a world of difference,” Lawrence said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The TPS Teach-In Panel is one of two events in CAUSA’s Central American Series, with another event titled “Social Activism through Social Media” on April 12. The series is both a celebration of Central American cultures and a display of resilience, Conde said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><b>To the Editor:</b></p>
<p class="p3">I am writing in response to the April 6 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/06/froid-21-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-irresponsible/">op-ed</a> “Inviting Jeb Bush to speak is irresponsible” by Michael Froid ’21, who committed a significant portion of his piece to Bush’s climate change policies. He based his argument that Bush does not hold a legitimate policy opinion about climate change on Bush’s 2011 statement that he does not accept man-made climate change. However, during Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign, the Center for Foreign Relations <a href="https://www.cfr.org/interactives/campaign2016/jeb-bush/on-energy-and-climate">stated</a>, “Bush acknowledges that human activity has contributed to climate change, but cautions against federal regulatory efforts that he says could stunt growth and raise consumer costs.” This policy position is reiterated in a 2016 The Hill <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/266716-climate-change-where-the-gop-field-stands">article</a> and a 2015 Bloomberg BNA <a href="https://www.bna.com/jeb-bush-takes-n17179934073/">article</a>. Froid explicitly wrote in his op-ed that this exact policy position “is a legitimate, if controversial, policy opinion.” I agree it is troubling that Bush once denied man-made climate change, and I also recognize that at times during his campaign he continued to waffle on how much of climate change is man-made, but it is irresponsible of Froid to base a large part of his argument against Bush’s invite on a single policy position from seven years ago that Bush has since revised.</p>

		<title>Miller &#039;19: Let students leave their mark on campus art</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/10/miller-19-let-students-leave-their-mark-on-campus-art/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Early on in my Brown career, I ascended the five-story staircase in the List Art Center, and level by level, discovered an ever-changing, floor-to-ceiling mural showcasing Brown’s most creative artists. When I introduce prospective students to Brown, I bring them to that staircase to view a unique side of our campus, an embodiment of the creative energy of our student body. I often wonder why Brown does not have more spaces like this.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown currently has a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/public-art/percent-art">“Percent-for-Art”</a> program, which ensures that “one percent of the construction budget of all new buildings and major renovations is devoted to the commission of artwork for the building or grounds.” While this project has contributed some of Brown’s most beautiful and memorable spots on campus, often featuring gracious gifts from alums, wouldn’t some of these spaces be further enriched by incorporating students’ art?</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown has a large and valuable untapped resource: visual arts concentrators and Brown-RISD dual degree students. Even more striking, in 2017, about <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/03/bai">60 percent</a> of students cited an art-related subject as their primary extracurricular interest. Just as students in other disciplines seek publication as validation of their experience in literary and laboratory endeavors, our art students should have more opportunities to contribute to their campus and gain artistic experience and credentials. There is a trove of students whose artistic contributions would enhance Brown’s spaces. </span></p>
<p class="p2">In 2017, Brown launched the Brown Arts Initiative to “fully integrate the arts into a complete liberal arts <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/03/bai">education.”</a> This project included increased access to the arts across departments and “new opportunities for teaching, research, artmaking, performance and experimentation.” It is intended to cement Brown’s commitment to the arts by creating more opportunities for students to engage through increased access to the arts and artists. However, the Initiative often focuses on bringing to Brown works of artists from outside of the Brown community. While we continue to enjoy the work of these artists, the Initiative should look to further integrate Brown art students into the process and allow them to leave a tangible impact on their campus.</p>
<p class="p2">Public art has positive benefits beyond just providing student artists with opportunities to showcase their work. For instance, it can have a positive mental impact on its viewers. Studies have shown public art can reduce levels of stress, foster an increased feeling of community and promote positive <a href="https://artmoi.com/blog/public-art-is-good-for-your-health/">health behaviors.</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Increasing public art will not only help the student artists behind the projects but also benefit other students and the community.</p>
<p class="p2">One need not look further than the BioMedical Center and List to see the value of public art. The huge posters adorning the facades of these buildings show photographic scenes of the impact of climate change in the Arctic. The posters are part of a larger initiative, “WeatherProof: Arts, Humanities and Sciences Explore the Environment,” spearheaded by five programs at Brown to “weave across barriers to examine environmental issues with a multidisciplinary lens,” The Herald previously <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/04/weatherproof-explores-climate-change-multidisciplinary-lens/">reported.</a> Their focus is not only about visual pleasure, but seeks a more profound impact, leading students to see and contemplate vital issues facing the community. It also shows that art is often multidisciplinary and can have a significant impact in the sciences, environmental justice campaigns and much more. With students contributing to public art through multidisciplinary projects centered on the issues most important to them, they can create art that is impactful and pertinent to the Brown community.</p>
<p class="p2">Art does not need to be the next “Mona Lisa” to encourage discussion or act as a rallying point for students, either. At the least, “Blueno,” the 23-foot blue teddy bear plopped onto Ruth Simmons Quad, has been a point of commonality among all Brown students. Even strangers on campus can safely ask “How do you feel about Blueno?” and expect an opinion and discussion. The same goes for “Ideas of Stone,” the ersatz tree next to the real ones on the Main Green. Even unpopular art serves a purpose on campus.</p>
<p class="p2">Not all public art needs to be by a renowned author. Our students are talented and well-trained and we should view their work with the confidence that it will contribute positively not only to our campus, but also to a wider community. If art is meant not only to adorn, but to foster creative thought and conversation, should we not look to encourage the greatest contribution from our own students? Is this not the essence of a Brown college experience?</p>

		<title>Sweeney ’19.5: Why we must respect Jeb Bush’s right to speak</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Jeb Bush should be allowed to speak at Brown. In his Apr. 9 op-ed in The Herald, Mark Liang ’19 offered many good points for why this should be the case. But his arguments about why Bush should be allowed to speak endanger liberal democracy by encouraging tribalism and exacerbating political polarization. Further, his proposed solution of personally shaming Bush with protest signs that say “PLEASE CLAP” is atrocious. We can and must aim instead for mutual respect in our political discourse.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Firstly, the main issue with Liang’s perspective is that it condescends to the political right in a tribalist manner, and in doing so violates the concept of mutual respect that is required of a multiparty liberal democracy. He says, “we have to recognize that (Republicans) are there and learn how to beat them.” This is objectionable in that he views political debate as a struggle between two factions where winning is of the utmost importance. His column suggests that liberals should always win. The better argument is that the discourse between liberals and conservatives, and everyone in between, should help to shine light on the truth and on our shared morality as human beings. Political debate should not be about winning, but about truth and justice, and absolutely requires the humility to accept that your ideas could be wrong. Liang shows no willingness to concede that he, in fact, could be wrong in his viewpoints and in his deeply held moral convictions, nor does he consider that humility and mutual respect are the reasons why Bush should be allowed to present his views at Brown. We cannot move on from political polarization until we, the next generation of American leaders, put justice before party and show respect for the ideas of others.</span></p>
<p class="p2">What’s more, it is widely accepted that Bush is, especially by today’s standards, a moderate Republican. He does not spew radical nonsense and conspiracy theories — instead he is informed, articulate and justifies his viewpoints with intellectual principles. Because Bush has shown respect for all those he engages with in political debate (even when President Trump attacked him in the Republican primaries in 2016), he deserves to be treated respectfully. It is for these reasons, as well as the simple fact that he is a human being and therefore deserves respect, that it is morally abhorrent to propose, as Liang does, that students should protest Bush with signs saying “PLEASE CLAP” — a reference to a vulnerable moment in which Bush asked the audience to clap during a stump speech for his presidential bid in 2016. To even suggest that it is morally tolerable to protest someone by invoking one of their most personally vulnerable moments — one which itself has minimal relation to politics — is unfathomable. To berate Bush with this type of ad hominem attack is to become a bully in the same manner that Trump has been, by using schoolyard taunts in place of reasoned and respectful debate. It is precisely this kind of backhanded comment, a personal attack in place of a political one, that threatens to increase political polarization. Liberal democracy is premised on mutual respect, which is undermined when we reduce our discourse to mere tribalism.</p>
<p class="p2">Although one should have respect for those willing to engage in genuine debate on political issues, there is some speech that is unequivocally beyond the pale. When hate speech is invoked in political debate, for instance, we should not legitimate it by inviting its advocates to campus. Yet at the same time, we should also not respond with personal attacks and taunts. To be clear, Bush does not meet the bar for hate speech and should be permitted to come to campus and respected when he arrives. But the health of our liberal democracy depends on the quality of our discourse, and even when we come across people with hateful views, it is important that we are able to marginalize those views through civil discussion rather than resorting to toxic discourse ourselves.</p>
<p class="p2">Some people would surely say that Bush’s viewpoints are immoral and therefore the type of protest advocated for by Liang is justified. To them I say, we must always treat others with respect in our political discourse: It does not depend on what others say or do. Personally shaming Bush is a morally bankrupt idea and ought not to be tolerated by Brown students or by the Brown administration.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the first scene of “A Quiet Place,” the new film from actor and director <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/05/conversation-john-krasinski-01/">John Krasinski ’01</a>, a family tiptoes around an abandoned general store to gather a few necessities. We hear the soft taps of their bare feet on the linoleum and the slight rattle of pills in a bottle as the mother carefully picks them up. No one speaks, and nothing goes boom. And yet the longer the quiet lingers, the more uneasy we become. It’s an effective opener, putting the audience on edge as they wait for a pin to drop. But it also puts into stark relief what is maybe an obvious realization: Most movies are awfully loud, aren’t they?</span></p>
<p class="p4">The decibel count eventually goes up in “A Quiet Place,” and the movie becomes significantly less interesting when it does. But for a few brief stretches, the film uses silence in a way that sets it apart from most movies of its ilk. The quieter something is, the closer we listen, and “A Quiet Place” occasionally takes this lesson to heart, using it to craft some delicious scares and to deploy tension with admirable finesse. Had Krasinski been more ruthless in sticking to his premise, the film might have been a real nerve-jangling knockout. But as it stands, “A Quiet Place” is decent, scary fun.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The story unfolds in a world ravaged by nonhuman predatory creatures. Gifted with extremely sensitive hearing, they hunt and kill anything within earshot with quick, violent efficiency. The stakes are viscerally established at the beginning of the film when a child, Beau, is snatched up mere seconds after his electric rocketship toy makes noise.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beau’s death will haunt his parents, Lee (Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt), and their other two children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe), for the rest of the film. The four of them live in a country farmhouse surrounded by rows of corn, where they’ve created a viable but always precarious lifestyle amongst the world’s new order of violence. Sand muffles the sound of footsteps on the paths around the property, paint circles mark the floorboards that creak the least, and leaves replace plates to prevent dinnertime clanking. And, of course, the family almost never speaks aloud to each other, instead communicating through American Sign Language.</span></p>
<p class="p4">But they persist. Perhaps the most obvious sign of their optimism is the fact that Evelyn is pregnant, although this comes across as a little more delusional than Krasinski may have intended. Babies are great, but not exactly silent, and the solution the film proposes to this is patently absurd. So is most of the stuff in this movie, as a matter of fact, but nobody likes a pragmatic scold, and I don’t intend to be one.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nothing particularly scary happens for much of the film — we watch the family merely live their lives and act out some dull smudges of emotional drama. The cast, at least, is good, including Blunt — married to Krasinski in real life — and Simmonds, a deaf actress who, between this and last year’s “Wonderstruck,” is shaping up to be one of the most talented young actors in Hollywood. And everything is nicely accented by the fluid cinematography of Charlotte Bruus Christensen.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But at least one scene amidst the film’s more sedate first half really sticks with you: As Lee and Marcus walk back to the farm from a fishing expedition, they come across an old man standing by his wife’s bloody corpse. His face is troubled, his lips curled inward. Just as they start to run, the old man lets loose a mournful scream. In seconds, he is killed. In this world, to scream is to die; to express pain is to be ended by it. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The motif of the scream returns twice more throughout the film, and both moments are among the film’s best. But too much in between lacks urgency or invention. An expert set piece turns into a bloated latter half of a film, story beats are repeated and cheap jump scares crop up like cornstalks in the springtime. Meanwhile, excess noise starts to seep into the film’s meticulous soundscape, from Marco Beltrami’s score to the smorgasbord of overused sound effects. Krasinski spends a lot of his time shushing people in this movie; it’s a shame the same impulse didn’t make it into his direction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As it nears its end, “A Quiet Place” grasps around for a conclusion for a while without ever really finding one, eventually coming to a defiant halt that only works if you don’t think about it for too long. And maybe you shouldn’t. All I know is when the last shot cut to black, the audience clapped and I took my hand away from eyes and said “what’d you think?” to the person next to me, it felt good to speak again.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The greatest threat currently facing the United States’ democracy comes from within, said U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-CA, during a Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy lecture Monday. Schiff, who gave a lecture entitled “Threats to Democracy,” spoke about a wide array of issues that weaken American and global democracies, such as the rise of autocracies and political attacks on the media. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Schiff — who has been a member of Congress since 2001 and currently serves as the ranking member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence — began his lecture by speaking about recently-debated Russian interference in the last presidential election. After Republican members argued that insufficient evidence existed to prove collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, the House Intelligence Committee ended its investigation into the matter <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-intelligence-committee-ends-russia-probe-party-line-vote-n859126">earlier this year. </a></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Schiff told The Herald that he disagrees with the Republican consensus, as he feels that there is “evidence in plain sight” that collusion occurred. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">During the lecture, he also spoke about the grave implications of purported Russian influence on the 2016 election. “Democrats have a tendency to think too narrowly about what (Russia’s interference) means. Russia had every reason to prefer (President) Trump.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“But far more fundamental to what the Russians were after was tearing at the very fabric of our democracy,” he added. “They looked at the divisions within our society … and they sought to widen the gulf.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Schiff also referenced Russian involvement in recent European and Balkan elections, and argued that the interference tactics that Russia used in the United States were not new. “What was new was that they decided to do this to the strongest democracy on earth and to an unprecedented degree.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Given that “autocrats around the world are on the rise,” Russian interference in the U.S. election is even more significant, Schiff said, adding that “the very idea of liberal democracy is at risk.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yet, Schiff still emphasized that the risks posed by external factors to American democracy were less serious than actions taken by the Trump administration. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Every day, we see our system of checks and balances, the heart and soul of our democracy, being whittled away” by the administration, he said, adding that the President’s attacks on the media and his encroachment on the Department of Justice also constitute threats to American democracy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With regard to the firing of Andrew McCabe, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s former deputy director, and the pardon of Joseph Arpaio, who was convicted of racial profiling as a law enforcement officer, Schiff said the White House has broken “down the wall of independence between the White House and the Justice Department.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Trump’s repeated attacks on the media also hurt the United States’ political system, Schiff said. Denigrating the press when an objective reality exists “can have serious, long-lasting damage to our democracy,” he added. The President’s actions have caused Schiff to adjust the focus of the Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press — a bicameral, bipartisan caucus that Schiff founded in 2006 — to protecting the press inside the United States. The Freedom of the Press Caucus generally seeks “to advance press freedom around the world by creating a forum to combat and condemn media censorship and the persecution of journalists around the world,” according to a University <a href="http://watson.brown.edu/taubman/events/2018/congressman-adam-schiff-threats-democracy">press release for the event. </a></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ultimately, congressional inaction to address Trump’s treatment of the media has compounded the problem, Schiff said. He described Republican silence in the face of Trump’s actions as “political cowardice.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Throughout the lecture, moderators and audience members had the opportunity to ask Schiff questions. Nina Tannenwald, a senior lecturer in political science, asked Schiff for his opinion on the “charge that the U.S. has interfered with elections in other countries.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Schiff said that while “these accusations have far too much merit to ignore, … I hope that we would put that in the past.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We really are indispensable in the way that no other country is positioned to be as great of a force for good,” he added. However, Schiff warned attendees that the continuation of the Trump administration’s practices could erode the American democratic ideal. “If this administration should go on beyond one term, then I think that the rest of the world has to conclude that America is not the country that it used to be,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking to the future, Schiff told The Herald that he believes the Democrats will retake the House in the 2018 elections. “Democrats need to campaign on a return to decency. They need to generate a positive reason to vote for Democrats, rather than just incentive to turn out against Trump.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This Saturday, the literary arts department celebrated the 25th anniversary of Ugly Duckling Presse, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit editorial collective that prides itself on publishing experimental, non-commercial literature, according to head editor and founder Matvei Yankelevich. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The all-day programming included a book display in the John Hay Library, a roundtable of distinguished small press editors and writing-inspired performances and readings by five Ugly Duckling-published writers, including University professors Cole Swensen and Monica de la Torre.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ugly Duckling Presse began as an experimental zine haphazardly assembled by Yankelevich and his friends while they were undergraduates at Wesleyan. By the early 2000s, it had transformed into a volunteer-based, nonprofit editorial collective, publishing chapbooks, books of poetry, experimental nonfiction, performance texts and translations. Today, Ugly Duckling releases over 20 titles a year and was once lauded as the “preeminent nesting ground for swans of the avant-garde poetry scene,” by The New York Times. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ugly Duckling is defined by its longstanding commitment to experimentation. Unlike big-name publishing houses that are all-too-concerned with commercial viability and staying “on brand,” Ugly Duckling strives to “create an experience of artwork that circumvents the utilitarian mode of consumption,” Yankelevich said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re publishing things because we love the work … because it has significance. We’re not really publishing things that will make money,” Yankelevich added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ugly Duckling’s mission was concertedly praised by audience-members and authors throughout the event’s many programs. “I don’t think any other press would have been as adventuresome or open to what we wanted to do,” Swensen said, prefacing excerpts from “Greensward,” a book of poetry that she and graphic artist Shari DeGraw published with Ugly Duckling in 2010. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The programming grounded itself in the Small Press Roundtable, where Ugly Duckling Presse editors Anna Moschovakis and Yankelevich discussed the current challenges facing small presses alongside Patrick Riedy ’18 MFA, Damon Krukowski, Stephen Motika and Visiting Lecturer in Literary Arts Erica Mena — all of whom are also editors of distinguished small presses, including Pressboard Press, Exact Change, Nightboat Books and Anamolous Press, respectively. The featured editors spoke gaily about a range of critical issues — from editorial education to navigating digital distribution to the uncertain fate of the National Endowment for the Arts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We don’t even know if the NEA will even exist next year. It’s a small but significant part of our budget when we get this grant, so it’s always frightening when our funding is in peril,”Yankelevich said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following the roundtable were a number of artistic performances inspired by Ugly Duckling texts, including a dance by Allissa Cardone and Sara June informed by a translation of Tatsumi Hijikata that was recently published by the Presse. Hijikata was a legendary Japanese choreographer in the mid-20th century, and “Costume En Face: A Primer of Darkness for Young Boys and Girls,” is one of the first translations of his notebook notations ever published in English.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(The text) is really dense, there’s such an incredibly rich array of spaces and characters. We both attacked the book and looked at the images,” Cardone said. “I’m a postmodern choreographer … so I was really interested in how to generate movement from it.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Students and community members flocked to Salomon 101 Monday to attend the opening event of the 17th annual Ivy Film Festival, a screening of #TAKEMEANYWHERE, the participatory art piece and short film created by Shia LaBeouf, Luke Turner and Nastja Säde Rönkkö. Following the screening, LaBeouf and Turner took to the stage to answer questions pre-submitted to IFF, as well as those from audience members.</p>
<p class="p2">Composed of 95 Brown and Rhode Island School of Design students, the largest student-run film festival in the world is in its biggest year yet, said managing director of IFF Jake Anderson ’18 in the event’s introduction. The 2018 festival features “seven industry guest speakers, five advanced screenings of studio films, a curated selection of 26 student short films, 15 student screenplays and five student virtual reality pieces, representing 25 countries,” Anderson said. The selection of short films will also show at 20 satellite locations across the globe.</p>
<p class="p2">The festival’s keynote feature, #TAKEMEANYWHERE, is the product of a month-long project by LaBeouf, Turner and Rönkkö to “hitchhike the internet” during summer of 2016. The trio posted their geographic coordinates online and opened their lives up to strangers to allow them to direct the artists’ adventure. Beginning in Boulder, Colorado, the team traversed the American Southwest, and moved eastward before climbing north and charting the U.S.-Canada border to eventually land in Alaska.</p>
<p class="p2">“Each night going to bed … your head would hit the pillow after a long day that was different than the previous day and you’d go to bed thinking anyone could turn up in the morning,” Turner said. “Anything could happen.”</p>
<p class="p2">However, LaBeouf noted that the team did not intentionally put themselves in harm’s way along the trip, and could have refused rides they felt were dangerous. “We didn’t encounter any kind of negative energy at all,” LaBeouf added.</p>
<p class="p2">Commissioned by the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art and the Finnish Institute in London, the project originated in response to the theme of “corruption” that was highlighted by the Boulder Museum’s performance art festival, MediaLive, LaBeouf said. But the idea had been on their minds already, with its roots in an earlier work by Rönkkö with the same title in which she rode a horse blindfolded. The artists even looked to Dr. Seuss’ “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” for inspiration, LaBeouf added. “So, the internet was our horse,” Turner said.</p>
<p class="p2">Known for his roles in blockbuster films such as “Transformers” and “Fury,” his time on Disney Channel as Louis on “Even Stevens,” and more recently his pieces of performance and participation art, such as the YouTube sensation, “Just Do It.”, LaBeouf reached out to Turner after discovering his work including his 2011 “The Metamodernism Manifesto,” and the duo met soon after in London. Turner connected LaBeouf with Finnish performance artist Rönkkö — whom he’d known since college — and the trio formed.</p>
<p class="p2">“We hatched a plan and two weeks later Shia turns up on the red carpet in Berlin with a paper bag over his head saying “I’m not famous anymore” on it and it became huge,” Turner said. “We never looked back.”</p>
<p class="p2">The film is as much a story of their journey — an image of the America they encountered — as it is a collection of the stories of the people they met along the way: One man showed off his collection of sneakers, a woman talks of her short-lived marriage after high school, a group drives from Florida to meet them in Alaska for a matter of minutes before turning back. Later, the film features a conversation between the artists and a man, who, while speeding down the highway, attempts to teach them how to load and shoot a gun. This interaction contrasts with that between the trio and the next group of participants along their journey — a large Mormon family who welcomes them into their home. The film was met with many bouts of laughter, as it depicted the realistic and relatable nature of the journey while it maintained and portrayed the serious essence of the participants’ stories.</p>
<p class="p2">“People open up really quickly and talk about the most personal things,” Turner said, and added that “it’s almost like people come to art to experience those things and express them.” This expression “became a kind of theme of the film,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Participants in the project appear in the film in different ways — some only audibly, some only visually, while others still do not appear at all. “Some people will open up to you only when the camera’s gone, some people see a camera and immediately open up,” LaBeouf said.</p>
<p class="p2">All of the participants have remained connected through a Facebook group constructed along the journey, LaBeouf and Turner explained. “Thankfully, this work — perhaps more than others — has this community that’s built around it,” Turner said.</p>
<p class="p2">“This is pre-Trump, this is … a different America. So, it was just different, it was just a different landscape. It wasn’t as fired up — as divisive,” LaBeouf said.</p>
<p class="p2">In 2016, LaBeouf, Rönkkö and Turner responded to the election results by collaborating on the performance piece hewillnotdivide.us, which invited people to repeat the phrase “he will not divide us” in reference to President Trump. The project began the day of the inauguration at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, with plans for it to be livestreamed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the duration of Trump’s presidency.</p>
<p class="p2">“Nobody wants to be cool anymore, but everybody wants to be relevant, and so … there’s nothing more relevant than being here,” Labeouf said. “It’s the biggest student-run film festival and that just feels very, very relevant.”</p>
<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Shia LaBeouf  played Steven in "Even Stevens." In fact, he played Louis in "Even Stevens." The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UCS aims to increase filtered water access</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To address student concern about a lack of water bottle filling stations on campus, the Undergraduate Council of Students’ committee on campus life has submitted a proposal to the Department of Facilities Management to add 10 new stations around the University. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brown has been working to eliminate single-use plastic water bottles on campus since 2008, when it promised to decrease disposable water bottle use by 80 percent on campus over the following four years, according to the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/initiatives/brown-is-green/initiatives/water/beyond-bottle">Brown is Green</a> initiative’s website. Today, Brown Dining Services “does not sell single-use plastic bottles of still water,” wrote Ann Hoffman, director of administration at Dining Services, in an email to The Herald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The University also provides every first-year with a reusable bottle on move-in day, according to the website.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But several parts of campus suffer from a lack of water filling stations, making it difficult for community members to refill reusable bottles, said several students interviewed by The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Claire Heiden ’21, a member of the UCS campus life committee, referred to these areas as “water deserts” — places where “literally, there’s no access” to filtered water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Keeney Quadrangle, for example, there are no water bottle filling stations anywhere in the residence’s three first-year dorms. The quad serves as the “largest self-contained residential unit on campus” and houses about 600 students, according to the Office of Residential Life’s website. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heiden and Harold Truong ’21, another member of the committee, are coordinating the UCS initiative to put water stations in these areas, including the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, the Center for Information Technology and the Arnold Lounge in Keeney Quadrangle, Heiden said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The fact that people have to plan way ahead in order to fill up their water bottle is a big impediment,” she said, adding that it “undermines the University’s environmentally sustainable values.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though there is not currently a timeline for the implementation of this initiative, Heiden and Truong submitted a draft of the proposal earlier in the semester to Erin Donnellan, academic and student engagement coordinator at the Office of Energy and Environmental Initiatives in Facilities Management. Truong said they anticipate meeting with Facilities Management after the proposal is finalized.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The first step is to assess the students’ proposal and bring other Facilities staff members into the conversation,” Donnellan wrote in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The initiative builds on a project started last year by Yutong Liu ’20, a former member of the committee, Truong said. Liu is still involved with the initiative, Heiden added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heiden and Truong’s proposal points to a UCS survey sent to undergraduate students earlier this year, in which about 89 percent of over 250 respondents ranked the importance of increasing access to water bottle filling stations as “four or more on a scale of one to five,” Truong said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because many students can only get water from bathroom sinks, “they are either buying bottled water (or) getting filters,” said Camila Pelsinger ’20, chair of campus life and vice president-elect of UCS.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The University has tested a representative sample of the water in every residence hall and determined that none contain lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency’s action level of 15 parts per billion, according to the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/Administration/EHS/drinking_water/">Environmental Health and Safety office</a>. However, because of the potential health risks associated with any level of exposure, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/basic-information-about-lead-drinking-water">EPA guidelines</a> state that drinking water should not contain any lead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Multiple students interviewed by The Herald expressed concern about drinking tap water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Zuhal Saljooki ’21, who lives in Keeney Quad, said she she worries water from the sink might contain lead. As a result, Saljooki goes outside her dorm to find filtered water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The closest place is the (Sharpe Refectory), … but then I have to use a meal swipe,” Saljooki said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Emma Dennis-Knieriem ’21, who also lives in the quad, said she fills her water bottle from the sink but does not feel entirely comfortable doing so. “I was just told by (Residential Peer Leaders as) a warning … there is some worry about the water (and) there may be some kind of lead,” Dennis-Knieriem said. “I would definitely prefer to know that the water I’m drinking doesn’t have lead in it.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Truong and Heiden said they will both continue to work on the project until the new water bottle filling stations are installed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I feel like this is something that shouldn’t even be negotiable,” Truong said. “We should have access to water in every building.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Regular decision college applicants spend months anxiously awaiting their admission decisions. Come decision day, many applicants are met not with letters of acceptance or rejection, but with a third option — a wait list offer. Cristiana Quinn, an independent college admission advisor, said she thinks the practice of placing college applicants on wait lists has “gotten out of hand.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the University admitted a total of 2,566 students to the class of 2022, it also extended wait list offers to 2,724 applicants this year, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2018/04/02/colleges-and-high-schools-again-debate-use-waiting-lists-admissions">Inside Higher Ed reported</a>. Many colleges have recently drawn criticism for offering spots on their wait lists to thousands of applicants, but Dean of Admission Logan Powell said these figures are “misunderstood … (and) taken out of context.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Powell emphasized that only around 60 percent of students who are offered a spot on the University’s wait list end up accepting the offer. Because of this, the true size of the active wait list typically averages around 1,500 students, Powell said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University uses its wait list to fill spots in the incoming class that are still available after the May 1 enrollment deadline. Since the number of available space in the class isn’t finalized until this date, the University doesn’t begin accepting students off the wait list until the first week of May, Powell explained.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Students on the wait list aren’t ranked in any way. Instead, “we look first at the composition of the enrolled class, and then we try to round things out based on the students that are still active on our wait list,” Powell said. The size of the wait list gives the admission office enough flexibility to admit students “who fit those categories that (we’re) looking to fill out in the first-year class,” Powell added. When finalizing the class, the office may look to promote “gender balance,” admission of first-generation students and diversity of academic interests.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">For the past two admission cycles, the admittance rate off of the wait list was 5.5 percent, “approximately the same as the acceptance rate for regular decision applicants,” Powell wrote in a follow-up email.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Quinn said many colleges offer a similar explanation for their large wait lists. “I think it’s absurd,” she added. “Colleges run numbers all the time — they’ve gotten very good at this — to figure out their yields.” With precise estimates of yield, Quinn said colleges should be able to maintain smaller wait lists that are “maybe five or even six times as large as the number of students that they’re going to take” off the wait list.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">B</span><span class="s3">ut Powell stressed that it is difficult to estimate how many students they will be able to accept off the wait list. “Predicting our yield is largely scientific, but it’s not perfect,” he said. “We make a number of (admission) offers that we think will get us close to our target (class size). But in any given year, you may be really close, (or) you may not be.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In the past five years, we’ve admitted as few as two students from the wait list and as many as 300,” Powell added. “With that as our high-water mark, we have to be in a position to be able to have choices if we need to admit as many as a couple hundred students from the wait list.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Still, Quinn expresse</span><span class="s4">d a sense that wait listing is becoming more common. “Although all my students were accepted to college, all of my regular decision kids were also wait listed at (three to six) colleges,” Quinn wrote in a follow-up email to The Herald. “And at two very competitive Catholic colleges, I did not have a single student rejected. All were either accepted or wait listed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Rahul Mani ’21 and Mike O’Connell </span><span class="s3">’21 were both wait listed by five schools, including the University. “It felt kind of weird because I was wait listed at so many,” Mani said. “I was thinking stuff along the lines of, ‘Why me? Why couldn’t I have gotten into one or two of these, or at least have been accepted or rejected, so I knew where I stood?’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After O’Connell received a string of wait list offers from his top-choice schools, he said he took a few days to come to terms with his situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You just have to wait it out. They’ll tell you eventually.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Quinn said she thinks schools that maintain large wait lists “do a disservice to students” by giving them a false sense of hope for their acceptance. “I think that the average student — when they get a wait list offer — thinks, ‘I’m almost in.’ And I think that in their mind, they don’t understand how large the waiting list is,” Quinn explained. “Students … don’t make as thoughtful decisions on where they’re going to attend among the colleges where they are accepted because they’re still holding out that hope for the waiting list.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Powell stressed that the University instructs all wait listed applicants to enroll at another institution. “One of the fallacies of how this process works is students forego all other opportunities and remain on our wait list. That’s absolutely not the case,” Powell said. He also pushed back on the notion that the odds of acceptance off the wait list are exceedingly slim. “It’s a very real opportunity. For those 75 to 100 students a year who are admitted from the wait list, I think they’re pretty happy that they accepted the offer of the wait list and (that) they were a little patient. … So there is hope, there absolutely is.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mani said he had some cautious hope “that I could get off a wait list because there were a number of schools that I was wait listed at.” But his position on several wait lists made him uncertain where he would end up. “A lot of my friends already knew where they were going — they were all set — whereas I still wasn’t entirely sure where I was going to go to school,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O’Connell said he was glad to be wait listed, given his eventual acceptance. “But I can understand where a lot of students would be kind of upset with the system because you’re just leading a lot of people on,” he added. “If I hadn’t been admitted here, I definitely would’ve had a much different view of the wait list.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Powell said the University finishes admitting students off the wait list by June 30 at the latest “so students have some clarity on where they’re going to go.” Both Mani and O’Connell were admitted in May, well before the June 30 deadline. Though Powell said he thinks this is a reasonable timeframe for wait list admission, Quinn said she believes wait lists draw out an already lengthy admission process.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s definitely frustrating,” O’Connell agreed. “You just have to wait another month to find out something that probably won’t happen, but there’s just enough likelihood that it does happen that you still have to pay attention. It’s not full-on torture, but it’s a little bit painful to sit through that process again.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The State Judiciary Committee’s hearing on reproductive rights yesterday covered legislation that drew hundreds of community members to the State House, from high school students to baby boomers. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After beginning over an hour late, six bills related to reproductive rights were introduced for simultaneous consideration and commentary. The first five measures proposed limitations on women’s rights — “Recognizing the fetus as a human life upon the existence of a heartbeat,” “The Rhode Island unborn child protection from dismemberment abortion act,” two “Acts relating to criminal offenses - children” and “An act relating to health and safety - Born-alive infant protection act.” The sixth bill, the Reproductive Health Care Act, would replace outdated existing laws and safeguard the right to abortion at the state level.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Advocates demonstrating about reproductive rights represented diametrically opposed perspectives, which they defended with respectful conviction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m here to support the bill for reproductive rights, and I’m here because I believe the right to abortion is a fundamental part of women’s health care, a basic right that women all over America need to have, and all over the world need to have,” said Rebecca Atwood of Providence. “I want Rhode Island state law to reflect what the federal law is,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Joshua Santos, a sophomore at Providence College from Pawtucket, came to support his “pro-life” stance. He described his position as a matter of “human dignity,” explaining that “everyone should have the right to life.” He was also “hoping” to have some conversations with people from across the political aisle.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Women’s health care is about having women decide for themselves, not someone else decide for them, because it’s been too long (that) people keep telling us what to do. And our body is our body,” said Aneice Germain of Cranston. She described threats to reproductive rights as hitting “minorities” especially hard.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jocelyn Foye, co-creator of The Woman Project, a nonprofit that supports feminist art activism, said socioeconomic considerations factor into the abortion debate. When abortion is not allowed, women can be locked into a state of “extreme poverty,” she added. “We’re not looking to change people’s opinions of what is right; we’re not doing anything like that,” she said. Rather than thinking of abortion as the termination of a human life, “we’re actually very interested in making sure that women have bodily freedom,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the other hand, Loren Duhamel attended the rally because she “believe(s) in life; God created each one of us, and he’s the only one who has the right to take it, not each one of us, she said.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After the bills were introduced, the Committee opened the floor to community members who were for or against the bill. These community members debated whether the Reproductive Health Care Act was redundant in the context of Roe v. Wade, and the likelihood of the federal decision’s appeal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The proposed bill shares the ‘fetus-counts-for-nothing’ view of the abortion industry. It institutes a laissez-faire policy with respect to the termination of human life,” said Dwight Duncan, professor at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Access to reproductive health care is under attack in this country like never before,” said Sulina Mohanty of the North Kingstown Democrats. “There are laws on the books right now that don’t respect women’s essential rights, and that don’t respect the values that the vast majority of Rhode Islanders want to be protected,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After several hours of continued testaments in favor and against the legislation in question, the bills were not held to a vote and are instead being “held for further study,” according to WPRI.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Local hotline provides legal support to immigrants</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/10/local-hotline-provides-legal-support-immigrants/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Nearly two months after establishing a hotline that provides support to immigrants and minorities in Rhode Island, the Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance is focused on making small-scale community change by offering immediate support to its callers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Galvanized to collaborate by the election of President Trump, six local advocacy groups formed AMOR after a year’s worth of planning — Direct Action for Rights and Equality, the Providence Youth Student Movement, Fighting Against Natural Gas, Call Off Your Tired Old Ethics, Colectivo Sin Fronteras and Refugee Dream Center. Some of these organizations had previously collaborated to advocate for the rights of people of color, which made working together to conceptualize AMOR easier, said Catarina Lorenzo, the overseeing organizer of AMOR.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">AMOR offers support in English and Spanish and includes a two-part legal support team, with one specializing in immigration services and another in police violence. In addition, AMOR provides mental health care. The organization relies on two staff members and a network of around 60 volunteers to provide these resources to Rhode Island residents.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As of mid-March, the AMOR hotline had received approximately 10 calls, Lorenzo said, from people primarily seeking legal support for immigration issues. AMOR was created as a hotline with the priority of “stopping deportations and preventing deportations,” said Sophia Wright, a community organizer for DARE and organizer for AMOR, adding that it was intended to “be as a first line of defense, so we could have rapid response happening.” The hotline allows organizers to “come to the scene of the hurt as soon as possible, so that healing can happen,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Island has seen an increase in the detention of immigrants, Wright said. Her work with immigration organizing in Rhode Island — which extends beyond AMOR — and discussions with lawyers who collaborate with AMOR have shown her that “the shift has been happening since January towards detaining people in Rhode Island at a quicker rate for very minor things” that would not have faced the same consequences under the Obama administration. Examples include “courthouse pickups,” she said, pointing out that under the previous administration, immigrants would be picked up if they had committed a crime or had a pending order of deportation. “And now, what they’re doing is they’re picking up anybody who they find,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Basically, they’re picking up the low-hanging fruit: people who are not a threat to society, so that they can up their statistics to demonstrate that they are ‘taking out the riffraff.’ But essentially, what they are doing is taking out the most vulnerable: people going to routine immigration meetings, hearings, things to update their status,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even before the establishment of the hotline, AMOR circulated a petition in support of Lilian Calderon, an immigrant who was detained despite her lack of a criminal record,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>according to Uprise RI. “We did great; our community raised $10,000 in six days,” said Bella Robinson, executive director of Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics. Calderon and her husband were present for AMOR’s launch Feb. 14, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mayor Jorge Elorza issued a statement while Calderon was under threat of deportation, according to <a href="https://upriseri.com/news/immigration/2018-02-08-elorza-calderon/">Uprise RI</a>. “The case of Lilian Calderon, who has been here since she was three years old, who grew up in our city and who graduated from our public schools is a sad reminder of how wrongheaded our immigration policy is,” the statement read.</span></p>
<p class="p4">In addition to immediate and direct legal support, mental health services are crucial components, Wright said. “Because they’re experiencing that trauma, (people who need legal support) will also be needing mental health support — especially if somebody has been detained already,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “Having a mental health provider provide an assessment for the family is an extremely important element in a court case to prove that somebody shouldn’t be separated from their citizen children,” Wright said. “That’s been a huge reason for us to have a seriously well-equipped mental health network to actually support the legal process” at AMOR. This vein of resources has “definitely been effective; we have been able to link people up to counselors that can write those assessments” and submit them to court, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wright envisions that the scope of AMOR will eventually transcend immigration issues. “Hate crimes, criminalization of immigrants and criminalization of people of color” should all be discussed in the same category, Wright said. “Those things get pigeonholed in different categories,” she explained. “What AMOR has really done is unify all of those things” under an “umbrella,” which she described as issues of “white supremacy or capitalism.” “Colonialism” constitutes another unifying root of entrenched issues in this vein, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While rhetoric on capitalism and colonialism might come across as too academic, “when you fight against them in this way, it makes them very real, because you watch (the systems) play out on people’s real bodies,” Wright added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Last year, I had a serious problem at the court,” said Eva Davila, a Providence resident who was referred to AMOR by her psychologist. Lorenzo and AMOR put her in contact with an immigration lawyer as well as transportation to her court date, she added. Though Davila preferred not to elaborate on the specifics of her case, she said it was successfully resolved with AMOR’s support.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a nascent organization, AMOR is currently focused on increasing outreach and community awareness of the resources provided through the hotline. “The more outreach we’ll do in the community, the more types of calls we’ll see,” Wright said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">AMOR is pacing its expansion in order to ensure it provides effective service on a smaller scale. “Right now, AMOR is focusing on just doing our job well. We’re building systems that can be sustainable, so we don’t have a timeline for growth and expansion,” Wright said. “We want to make sure that we’re working with people.” For the time being, AMOR is planning trainings to increase the number of hotline operators and focusing on publicizing their initiatives throughout Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If 50 percent of Providence knew that we existed, could we handle the influx of calls? This is what I’m most concerned about and most interested in seeing AMOR be able to handle it realistically and sustainably,” Wright said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re never going to stop needing to support each other in this community, when we’re experiencing the abuse of the systems that are broken, so I think AMOR is something that can support us long-term.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“The New Barbarianism” opens with panning shots of shelled rubble, all that remains of the once-thriving city of Aleppo, Syria. The camera moves from overhead pictures to zoom in on destroyed medical facilities and dispirited doctors. The scenes in this documentary belie the lesson its creators and supporters hope to pass on: even war has rules.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A screening of the docu</span><span class="s4">mentary, followed by a discussion with the film’s executive producer as well as its writer and director, was hosted by the Humanitarian Innovation Initiative and The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at The Warren Alpert Medical School yesterday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The documentary’s makers hope that showing their creation to students will begin to address “a real knowledge deficit among the American public,” said Justin Kenny, the director and writer of the film and former senior foreign affairs and defense producer and editor for PBS NewsHour, to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The film depicts the recent and rising disregard for international humanitarian law throughout ongoing conflicts in countries such as Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan. Specifically, the film aims to document an increase in the deliberate targeting of hospitals, doctors and humanitarian workers in conflicts across the globe.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In Syria, more than 800 medical professionals have been killed since the beginning of civil war in 2011, the documentary’s narrator explained. “Many claim that the collapse of medical infrastructure in Syria propelled the mass exodus” of refugees to surrounding countries and the European continent, he said, his voice narrating clips of shelling, dust-covered bodies and frantic medical operations.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Experts such as David Miliband, former foreign secretary for the United Kingdom, Sen. John McCain, R-AZ, and Joanne Liu, president of Medecins Sans Frontieres, affirmed the film’s central theme — attacks on doctors and medical facilities represent a dramatic increase in the hostility toward non-combatants.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It is very striking that we’re living in an age of bombing U.N. convoys… (and) hospitals,” Miliband said in the documentary.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A health crisis has also struck Yemen, where another civil war backed by two warring nations, Iran and Saudi Arabia, is ravaging the country. Many of the country’s children are malnourished, more than half of the population has lost access to health care and a cholera outbreak has expanded to more than one million cases — one of the largest and fastest growing epidemics in modern history, according to the documentary.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In spite of this reality, the Western<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>public is largely ignorant of the details of the war and crises in Yemen, said J. Stephen Morrison, executive producer and director of the film and senior vice president and director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are one of the few organizations to show what’s going on in Sana’a (Yemen’s capital city) … because it’s virtually impossible to get in and virtually impossible to get out,” Kenny said. The documentarians partnered with underemployed filmmakers in Yemen to visualize the situation in the country for an audience with little to no knowledge of the conflict or the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In Syria, the team partnered with the Aleppo Media Group, which shot much of the drone footage seen in the film. In addition, the team bought some of the group’s previously archived footage to show the devastation in Syrian hospitals, Kenny said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Much of the discussion following the film centered on the role of the United States in both causing and resolving humanitarian crises. “The United States has the capacity to be a force for good,” Kenny said. However, the U.S. government funds the weapons used by Saudi Arabia in indiscriminate bombing of Yemen’s land, and “we really should not have our hands involved in that,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rashmi Sharma, the University’s disaster medicine and emergency preparedness fellow, reminded the audience to always reflect on the U.S. role in a conflict. “All of us have to be aware of international humanitarian law, and we need to stick to those rules,” she told The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Melissa Godfrey GS and Anna Makaretz GS, both students at The School of Public Health, are enrolled in PHP 1802S: “Human Security and Humanitarian Response: Increasing Effectiveness and Accountability” and were motivated to attend the screening by their professor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We don’t talk a ton about the realities in the field” in the class, “and so seeing this depiction is horrifying. But it’s also such a stark comparison to what we learn in class,” Godfrey said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In class, we’re learning that if you do A and C and D,… you are going to provide great humanitarian care. But it doesn’t work like that in reality,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Makaretz agreed, adding: “It’s very formulaic. And it doesn’t work like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kenny hopes that educating students at the medical school will increase awareness of situations faced by doctors in these global conflicts. “The American medical community has been pretty silent on the issue,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The documentary will be screened at The Hague in May and the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland in June, Morrison said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Conservative economist talks polarization</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">President of prominent right-wing thinktank the American Enterprise Institute and New York Times columnist Arthur Brooks spoke about uniting Americans in polarized times before a group of students, faculty and members of the Providence community Tuesday evening in Pembroke Hall. His talk, entitled “Bringing Americans Together,” was part of the Reaffirming University Values lecture series designed to foster dialogue and highlight diverse viewpoints on campus.</p>
<p class="p4">Brooks, a conservative economist, is the author of several influential books, including “The Conservative Heart: How to Build a Fairer, Happier, and More Prosperous America.” In a tight-fitting suit, he strode energetically as he spoke.</p>
<p class="p4">His lecture was specifically designed to challenge political and cultural polarization, he said. Citing his extensive work with the Dalai Lama, Brooks repeatedly emphasized the importance of listening to new ideas with openness. He offered a path toward prosperity in the United States that involves meeting anger in politics with warmheartedness.</p>
<p class="p4">“No one in the history of humanity has ever been insulted into agreement,” he said. “If politics is the politics of persuasion, we are failing.”</p>
<p class="p4">Brooks also outlined a conservative political program that he said emphasized dignity. The poor and marginalized, he said, must feel not just helped, but also needed.</p>
<p class="p4">Brooks opened his talk by focusing on white men from the ages of 45 to 54 — the only group in the United States with decreasing life expectancies, as a result of suicide, alcoholism and opioid addiction, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">“These, my friends, are deaths of despair,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">How to remedy this despair? His solution is work — of all kinds. “Work works,” he said. “All work has dignity, and all work has value.” In order for the United States to become “truly great again,” it needs to ensure employment for more of its constituency, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">When the lecture opened to the crowd for questions, several students inquired about his ideas: Did all employment dignify workers? What about menial, “Kafka-esque” tasks?</p>
<p class="p4">In response, Brooks cited a study that found 89 percent of Americans to be satisfied with their jobs. The man who makes your sandwich is as likely to enjoy his job as your professor, he said, adding that “your Kafka-esque experience depends a lot on your heart.”</p>
<p class="p4">President Christina Paxson P’19 billed Brooks as representative of “reform conservatism” and highlighted the importance of hearing opinions considered controversial on campus in her introduction.</p>
<p class="p4">Like Paxson, Brooks highlighted the importance of listening to others and dismantling what he calls a culture of “contempt” that plagues U.S. politics. Contempt is the complete belief in the worthlessness of another person and is most often signified by the eye roll, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Following some of the Dalai Lama’s personal advice, Brooks challenged the audience to meet contempt with warmheartedness.</p>
<p class="p4">“Warmheartedness is for strong people. Contempt is for weak people. Which are you going to be?” he asked.</p>
<p class="p4">In spite of this call to action, some students remained skeptical.</p>
<p class="p4">“I would be hard-pressed to pick a topic on which he is less qualified to speak than ‘bringing America together,’” said Isaac Bierer ’18.</p>
<p class="p4">Others approved of his talk. Maksymilian Dabkowski ’19 felt unconvinced that all labor could be dignified, but he enjoyed the lecture.</p>
<p class="p4">“I think it was very inspiring and enlightening,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Buchsbaum &#039;19: Disrupting the path to sexual assault perpetration</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2015, Kevin Swartout, an associate professor of psychology at Georgia State University, seemingly confirmed long-held doubts about the demographics of perpetrators of sexual assault when he published his article, “Trajectory Analysis of the Campus Serial Rapist Assumption.” Swartout dismantled clinical psychologist David Lisak’s 2002 study — “Repeat Rape and Multiple Offending Among Undetected Rapists” — which described assaulters as serial predators, “monsters” lurking among us. Lisak’s study stirred up a storm and influenced sexual assault prevention education for the better part of a decade, but further research on the same issue has identified different results.
<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In opposition to previous thought, Swartout’s study indicated that college-aged men who perpetrate assault tend to do so only once or twice, and often unknowingly. Moreover, he found that there was a temporally-linked switch: men who had assaulted prior to college often did not continue, and men who had not assaulted prior to college only began after they entered a new social sphere. Swartout sees a crucial environment shift: if men exit an environment tolerant of abuse of women and enter one that repudiates this behavior, they become less likely to offend. Unfortunately, the reverse holds true as well.</span></p>
<p class="p2">So, which is it? Are offenders serial perpetrators? Or are they oblivious individuals who don’t consider the harm they are doing to others? The answer is likely somewhere along a spectrum. Research has established that perpetrators justify their actions through assumptions about entitlement, power and privilege. What we need now is research on how to unlearn those assumptions and how those assumptions create the “monsters” of Lisak’s research.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Before New York Times reporters Meghan Twohey and Jodi Kantor broke their investigative story on Harvey Weinstein’s years of systematic abuse and assault of women in the film industry, I was inclined to believe that most assaults — in college, at least — fell into the category Swartout delineated: men who did not understand the totality of consent and who, often unknowingly, violated their partners. I was inclined to believe that serial perpetration was a myth. Perhaps that was my own naivety at hand, perhaps it was my own blinding desire to trust in the good of people. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Nonetheless, the Harvey Weinsteins, Matt Lauers and President Donald Trumps of the world clearly exist — men in roles of immense power abusing that power to coerce and hurt women, in a sick exercise of social and physical force over another’s body. But so too exist the Aziz Ansaris of the world — men who publicly commit to navigating the pitfalls of relationship dynamics and advocating for feminist causes, who nonetheless exercise their power coercively over another person’s body. A difference exists — many men, including Weinstein, consciously benefit from office cultures that silence conversations around sexual assault — but where does that lead? Is Ansari’s obtuseness and dismissal of Grace’s needs a solemn harbinger of what may ensue should no one illuminate to him how he caused harm?</p>
<p class="p2">I’m inclined to believe there may be a breaking point — a point of no return, so to speak — where after a given number of weird nights, uncomfortable extrications of bodies from beds, “C’mon, it’ll be fun”s, the Azizes of the world can morph into something darker. Someone who doesn’t know how to satisfy that desire any other way, someone who even thrives off that exercise of power over another person’s body. But where does that shift occur? On a drunken night after a rager in a basement, upon entering a cutthroat corporate hierarchy or after amassing enough power to silence any whistleblowers? Or is the entitlement to others’ bodies internalized from an early age and simply awakened through too many “I got away with it”s?</p>
<p class="p2">More research must be conducted — not just on college-aged men, though that demographic is an excellent locale in which to implement sexual assault prevention education. We need to think more expansively around the trajectory and hierarchy of these crimes. Weinstein and Lauer did not act in a vacuum — they lived and worked in environments that enabled their gross abuse of others. We need to think beyond college campuses as the source of the “assault issue,” adopt a multi-pronged approach to root out this point of no return and integrate a culture of consent into our daily lives. We need to teach from a young age how consent is not an abnormal entity that appears only at the door to a sexual encounter, but a routine component of regular interactions. And on the other end of the equation, restorative justice can be a mechanism by which colleges and workplaces intervene in problematic and violatory behavior so that perpetrators don’t reach that point of no return. Simultaneously, we need to identify the threshold where unlearning entitled, harmful behavior proves impossible.</p>
<p class="p2">Swartout’s research forwards that one’s environment factors into these transition points, indicating that fostering a culture of consent in all of our institutions — schools, businesses, governments — is crucial to reducing sexual assault. At Brown, we have begun the steps toward this comprehensive approach — the Undergraduate Council of Students requires that categorized student groups have a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/14/ucs-passes-campus-consent-amendment/">trained sexual assault peer educator</a> in their group, and we overhauled our <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/advocates-stress-training-address-rape-culture/">sexual assault prevention orientation</a>. But this type of research can provide a framework as we as a society grapple with how we rehabilitate or castigate perpetrators of sexual assault.</p>
<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this op-ed stated that Kevin Swartout seemingly confirmed long-held doubts about the demographics of perpetrators of sexual assault when he published his article, “The company they keep: How men’s social networks influence their sexually aggressive attitudes and behaviors.” In fact, Swartout seemingly confirmed long-held doubts about the demographics of perpetrators of sexual assault when he published his article, "Trajectory Analysis of the Campus Serial Rapist Assumption." An earlier version of this op-ed also stated that further research failed to reproduce the results of David Lisak’s 2002 study — “Repeat Rape and Multiple Offending Among Undetected Rapists." In fact, further issue on the same issue has identified different results. The Herald regrets the errors.</strong></em>

		<title>Israel &#039;21, Rock &#039;19: Rhode Island needs in-person early voting</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 37 states and Washington D.C., voters may cast a ballot in person at some point before election day; in Rhode Island, you cannot. This poses a barrier to accessing the ballot for people with inflexible work schedules, childcare responsibilities, lack of access to transportation and other reasons that might prevent a person from showing up to vote on election day. Hopefully, that will soon change: R.I. Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rhode-island/articles/2018-02-13/secretary-of-state-pushes-for-early-in-person-voting">introduced</a> a bill in this legislative session to allow Rhode Islanders to vote early, in person, as many as 20 days in advance of a primary or general election. The response to this bill has been neatly split along party lines: State GOP Chairman Brandon Bell <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180314/ri-advocates-of-early-in-person-voting-renew-push-for-legislation">told</a> the Providence Journal that he opposed the legislation because it would force voters to make decisions without “important information” which “usually comes to light later in the campaign.” Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo wrote in her testimony in support of the bill: “Our current system needlessly excludes many working Americans who are unable to cast ballots on election day due to inflexible schedules or other conflicts.”</span></p>
<p class="p2">Between 2006 and 2012, in-person early voting programs were expanded across the country, which allowed researchers to study the impacts of the legislation. The percentage of voters who cast their ballots in person grew in each election throughout that time frame. Some of the best-studied outcomes of the legislation were that in-person early voting reduced the stress on election officials on election day, which allowed them to carry out their jobs more effectively and led to shorter lines at the polls on election day, according to a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/early-voting-what-works">report</a> published by the Brennan Center for Justice.</p>
<p class="p2">But perhaps most importantly, early voting legislation has proven to enfranchise the populations of voters that have historically been prevented from voting through practices such as poll taxes, voter ID laws, racial gerrymandering and purges to voter rolls. These practices have impeded black and Latino Americans in particular from voting throughout history.</p>
<p class="p2">Early voting has been proven to increase voter turnout between 2 and 4 percent, with a higher increase among minority voters, according to an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/which-voters-show-up-when-states-allow-early-voting">article</a> published by ProPublica in 2016. According to a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/voting-rights/cutting-early-voting-voter-suppression">fact sheet</a> produced by the American Civil Liberties Union, 32 percent of ballots cast in the 2012 election were cast early, either in person or by mail. In 2008 and 2012, 70 percent of black voters in North Carolina voted early. In 2012, black voters in Ohio voted early at twice the rate of white voters.</p>
<p class="p2">In 2008 in Florida, a group of black church congregations organized a “Souls to the Polls” initiative in which they transported their congregations from church the Sunday before election day to vote early at polling sites. That year, black voters made up 13 percent of registered voters, but cast 22 percent of early ballots. In 2012, the Florida legislature passed a law to roll back early voting, but the law was struck down by the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C., because the judges found that the law violated the Voting Rights Act by disproportionately preventing black voters from voting.</p>
<p class="p2">In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder, ruling that the racial discrimination against voters that the Act was passed to prohibit no longer exists. In the wake of that decision, state legislatures across the country, especially those dominated by Republicans, passed laws that reduced access to the ballot in ways that particularly affected these historically disenfranchised voters. The ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/voting-rights/sos-voting-rights-act-need-immediate-repair">reported</a> in 2016 that following the Shelby decision, at least 17 states passed laws that restricted voting. In Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, the early voting periods were cut short, and in Wisconsin early voting on nights and weekends was eliminated, posing an obvious barrier to people with strict work schedules. We hope to reverse that trend here in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p2">Today, Brown students will be meeting under Faunce Arch to leave at 3 p.m. to join groups including Common Cause of R.I., the Working Families Party and the NAACP of Providence to participate in a lobby day in support of the early voting bill. Please join the Brown Progressive Action Committee, your peers and activists in Rhode Island to ask legislators to expand voting access in the state. We only live in a democracy so long as people are able to vote.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b>To the Editor:</b></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I am writing in response to Brendan Sweeney’s ’19.5 April 10 op-ed <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/10/sweeney-19-5-must-respect-jeb-bushs-right-speak/">“Why we must respect Jeb Bush’s right to speak.”</a> I agree with both Mark Liang ’19 and Sweeney that Jeb Bush should be allowed to speak at Brown. However, Jeb Bush has no right to my respect — to argue that “PLEASE CLAP” signs are significant contributors to political polarization and tribalism is incorrect and seriously misguided.</span></p>
<p class="p3">My outrage over the opinions expressed in Sweeney’s article (and make no mistake, I am outraged) comes from the absurd amount of attention Bush’s feelings are being given proportional to the tangible harm effected by Bush. It is absurd to argue that it is morally abhorrent to hold “PLEASE CLAP” signs in light of the moral abhorrence of the suffering inflicted by Bush’s opposition to a 2014 Florida initiative that would have legalized marijuana for medical use. It is absurd to maintain that the “health of our liberal democracy depends on the quality of our discourse” when Bush only called for “respect” for same-sex marriages after they were made legal in Florida. It is absurd to denounce viewing political debate as a “struggle between two factions” when Bush supported perpetuating the war in Iraq, which has killed 500,000 people since the start of the U.S. invasion.</p>
<p class="p3">Liberal democracy may well be premised on mutual respect. But I was raised to believe that respect is earned, not demanded. What is demanded are answers, and Bush had better come prepared.</p>

		<title>Derek Penslar explains dependency of Israeli state</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/12/draft-cronin-event/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Derek Penslar, visiting professor of history from Harvard, spoke about the dichotomy of Israeli independence and dependency at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs Wednesday. His talk detailed how Israel became a state through the support of various people, documents and nations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lecture was a part of the Israel-Palestine Distinguished Lecture Series, which is organized by Professor of European History and German Studies Omer Bartov.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Penslar’s discussion argued that the notion of dependency was central to Israel’s founding. Since the the late 1800s, and even before that, Penslar said that Jewish individuals often depended on the protection of kings. Even with the initial notions of a Zionist nation in Theodor Herzl’s “The Jewish State of 1896,” Penslar said that Herzl’s own definition of the state was “vague, unsure, flexible about the form of the polity.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a debate in 1898, Herzl said, “Well, what is a state? A big colony. What’s a colony? A small state.” Penslar argued this tone continued the “historic Jewish dependence on the state.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the Balfour Declaration of 1917, Penslar said that the Zionist Movement was still unsure of its intentions. Many Jewish people were incredibly grateful to Great Britain for its support of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, Penslar said. But many anti-imperialists remained skeptical, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This complex and ambiguous relationship between gratitude and dependence on one hand, and pride and independence on the other, is even more illustrated by the practices of likening the Balfour Declaration to the Magna Carta,” Penslar said. Proponents valorized the magnitude of both documents, but according to Penslar, the Magna Carta was<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a “concession of aristocratic privilege.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 1948, Israel became its own state, but still needed the aid of others to survive, Penslar said. Unlike other post-colonial nations, “the Zionists had no patron state.” Even though the United States recognized Israel in 1948, it did not arm Israel the way China armed the Viet Minh, he added. Instead, the Israelis were armed by Zionists in other countries.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel itself was unique to other post-colonial declarations of independence, Penslar said. Unlike the U.S. Declaration of Independence, which specifically cuts ties with Great Britain, the Israeli document is “about the historic and collective rights of the Jewish people.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It is an assertion of self-constitution, not separation,” Penslar said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Over time, Israel has gained the appearance of independence, but is still strongly tied to the United States and other countries, Penslar said. For example, the nation became a Major non-NATO ally.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sarah Campbell Tucker ’19 was most interested in the description of Israel as both independent and dependent because she said Israel is thought “to have a lot of power in the world.” As a student in Bartov’s HIST 1969B: “Israel-Palestine: Lands and Peoples II” class this semester, Tucker said Penslar’s analysis of Israel’s Declaration of Establishment was an “interesting marker” of how Israel presents itself in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even in a difficult and polarizing political climate, Penslar said he feels that the people who take his classes and listen to his talks, as well as his colleagues, tend to be respectful and want to learn.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think there have been a lot of issues lately about people being upset when we bring … people from the extreme sides of issues, but I think that it’s still important to hear those voices. This I think is even more important because, especially with Israel-Palestine, a lot of the community is very polarized about it, and this (talk) brings to light that there is a middle ground,” said Johanna Garfinkel ’19.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">​​The Undergraduate Council of Students discussed a draft of a form intended to improve the process for reporting bias-motivated incidents at the University during its general body meeting Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although UCS President Chelse-Amoy Steele ’18 noted that the University has not committed to changing the reporting form, she said the involvement of “administrative divisions” including the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity, the Office of the President and the Office of the Provost makes her “feel really confident that something go</span><span class="s2">od is going to get done.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“This is something that we’re hoping will be (in use) by the end of the semester,” Steele said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Steele introduced the possibility of revising the current reporting form to make it more “robust” at a general body meeting in November, The Herald previously reported​​. Once finalized, this document would replace the current complaint form for such incidents, Steele said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The draft of the revised form, which Steele emailed to general body members earlier this week, includes more space for elaboration and some questions that are more specific than those included in the discrimination and harassment complaint form available on the OIED’s website​.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Instead of asking for a “summary of allegations,” for instance, the revised form asks the complainant to “provide a detailed description of the incident using specific, concise, objective language.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Because the revised form also allows complainants to report occurrences that are not bias-related, UCS Parliamentarian Austin Lessin ’19 and Jonathan Jaramillo ’18 suggested that the name of the form reflect the full range of reportable incidents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">For instance, Jaramillo noted that hazing could be reported through this form, but is not always bias-related.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“What if it’s hazing not as a result of bias at all?” Jaramillo asked. “What if it’s straight white men hazing other straight white men?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In smaller group discussions, Jaramillo and Lessin discussed calling the form a “bias, harm and violence reporting system” to include all types of incidents students could report.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Steele asked the general body how they felt the student body could best be “prepared to be able to engage with (the form)” while also feeling “supported along the process of reporting.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">To this end, members of the general body stressed the importance of providing clarity about the complainant’s anonymity and information about the timeline and potential outcomes of any events following the submission of a report.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Steele said she will update the general body following a meeting with Shontay Delalue, vice president for institutional equity and diversity.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Educational program unites video games, protein folding</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine playing a video game that also makes scientific contributions to the field of computational biology. Firas Khatib, assistant professor in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, discussed just that in his talk, “Crowd Computing: Scientific discoveries by protein-folding game players” at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics. Khatib’s program, Foldit, is a unique platform that integrates video games with protein folding to allow people all over the world to compete to devise an optimal protein fold for a given protein.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Khatib, the lead scientist of Foldit, emphasized that the program aims to build more accurate models of disease-related proteins.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“I think what’s exciting about Foldit is that it really demonstrates the power of citizen science and crowdsourcing,” he said, and added that there is currently an abundance of supercomputing strength, but Foldit focuses on harnessing human intelligence on a mass scale.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“When it comes to visual tasks … computers are really bad at that,” Khatib said. Identifying optimal protein folds, a visual task, is a skill that humans can sometimes provide more easily than computers. Furthermore, Foldit allows people with different perspectives to contribute to difficult problems. People who have no background in a field are more likely to implement unusual solutions, which sometimes turn out to be helpful, Khatib said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Because Foldit relies on human brain power, an important part of the project is introducing it to large audiences. Foldit is a “great tool for education,” Khatib said. “Everybody loves video games — especially kids.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Foldit has been used in award-winning projects by people all over the country, Khatib added. For example, a team of students at University of California-Davis used Foldit to build a biosensor that “detects rancid olive oil,” winning the grand prize at the 2014 iGEM international competition, Khatib said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m really impressed by the way (Foldit is) implementing this evolving model,” Woden Kusner, attendee and assistant professor of mathematics at Vanderbilt University, said after the event. “They’ve got a nice feedback loop going on with players and are able to get feedback from the scientific community.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“There’s such a big Foldit community out there,” said Jan Rolfes, a postgraduate researcher from the University of Cologne. “If you present science in such a nice way, you can attract a lot of people and really make an idea quite popular.”</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Community members have criticized and expressed disappointment in the University after it publicly emerged last week that the course, INTL 1802W: “International Journalism” asked students to find and profile DACA recipients living in Providence. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The incident has raised questions about ethical practices in journalism, the sensitivity training offered to faculty and the University’s process for approving course syllabi. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>INTL 1802W: “International Journalism”</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Taught by Stephen Kinzer, a senior fellow in international and public affairs, the seminar aims to give students “direct experience with the job of writing journalistically about world affairs … through a combination of writing exercises and classroom discussions,” according to an online copy of the course’s syllabus. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Because students could not travel abroad, the course sought to fulfill its goal by asking students to cover local stories related to global issues and produce stories “based on close reporting of affected people.” Specifically, Kinzer asked students to concentrate their coverage on the “fate of the so-called Dreamers,” according to the syllabus. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The course includes five mandatory assignments. While the first requires students to “immerse themselves in an immigrant environment in the Providence area,” the following four explore different aspects of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and culminate in a final comprehensive profile piece of a DACA recipient that examines their “day-to-day life.” The course syllabus does not suggest that these pieces are meant for publication. Students in the course were eventually given the option to interview recent immigrants more generally if they could not find a DACA recipient to interview.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Criticism and journalistic ethics</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Last week, the Brown Immigrant Rights Coalition published an open letter on Facebook that condemned the assignments as “exploitative journalism” and criticized the seminar’s particular focus on Dreamers. BIRC received feedback from concerned Providence community members who had been asked to comment by Kinzer’s students, according to the open letter. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The work produced in this (course) is not directly aimed at the uplifting and liberation of the affected people,” John Lopez ’18.5, Maria Camila Arbelaez Solano ’19, Alexis Roman ’21, Angel Mendez ’20, Kathleen Wu ’20 and Javier Juarez GS wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In previous times that I’ve spoken to media, it’s something that I’ve chosen to do for a particular purpose,” said Krissia Rivera Perla ’15 MD’21, a DACA recipient who was contacted to participate in the profile. Rivera Perla says she always assesses the likeliness that sharing her experience could inspire change before agreeing to an interview. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But in an email to The Herald, Kinzer wrote that the continued presence of anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States paints “young immigrants as a hostile horde that has come to our country to steal what belongs to us. The only way to counter this stereotype is to humanize these young people.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“Journalism is the way to do that. People who want to support and defend immigrants should be banging on the doors of media outlets demanding more coverage of their situation,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">In addition to learning more about journalism, Amy Kerner ’06 GS, a current student in the class, said she took the course to better understand the “complex immigration debate” in the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“I was really excited to take a course where I could go off-campus and learn more about the greater Providence community,” she said, adding that she also wanted to “learn how to transmit important political topics through the eyes of ordinary people.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I agree with Professor Kinzer that there is a need to have better coverage and discourse around the topic of immigration,” Lopez — the chair of BIRC — said. “What me and BIRC disagree with is the lack of care, preparation and thoughtfulness … that he has opened in structuring this course.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Specifically, BIRC members were concerned that the narrow focus on DACA risks misrepresenting the issue of immigration, particularly in the United States. In addition, students voiced larger questions about the media’s sense of entitlement when covering the stories of people belonging to marginalized communities. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the Brown community to truly understand the complexities of global migration, academic scholarship “needs to be expanded beyond a limited focus on DACA to a greater one that considers it alongside (Temporary Protected Status), (Deferred Enforced Departure), refugee status, forced displacement and the undocumented state itself,” according to BIRC. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivera Perla added that DACA recipients have already been humanized while others experiencing undocumentation, such as TPS and DED holders, have been deprived of attention and support. A majority of Americans feel that Dreamers should stay in the United States,<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/05/poll-trump-deporting-daca-dreamers-242343" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> as Politico previously reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivera Perla also contested Kinzer’s idea that journalism necessarily helps its sources. The idea of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“young people knocking on doors is like asking the media to tell our story as if they can tell it better than we can,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It should rather be that young people should rise and share their stories and the media should facilitate that,” she added. But seeking out stories of DACA recipients with the aim of bettering their situation presumes that the media has ownership of these stories, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Amelie Vavrovsky ’18, who attended two sessions before dropping the course, said she felt that “to go into a community that we have no connection to and extract information seemed unethical to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The best allies are the ones who ask the people who are undergoing certain strife what they need and not so much determining what they need,” Rivera Perla said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While she felt that the students in class had good intentions, Rivera Perla said asking individuals for their immigration status “lacked sensibility” and “placed everyone in a vulnerable position we did not choose.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“These are not just stories. They are lived and traumatic experiences and we will not stand for people taking advantage of them and causing further harm,” BIRC wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a follow up email to The Herald, Lopez wrote that students in the class should receive a form of comprehensive training because they were being asked to “dig for and to hold extremely sensitive information about Providence community members.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">During course meetings, Kerner said the class discussed ethical dilemmas in journalism on multiple occasions. “If someone agreed to speak with us, we should always present in detail clearly what we were doing and what the assignment was.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was important that people agreed to speak with us,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>University response</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In its open letter, BIRC called for better training for faculty and staff working with immigrant populations.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maud Mandel, dean of the college, said that the University debated making training related to diversity and inclusion mandatory for faculty and staff while creating the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan. However, the University decided against the practice. “Compliance-required training: Not only does it not work, but it actually has the opposite impact,” she said, citing scholarship on the subject. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Student criticism of Kinzer’s syllabus also called into question the University’s process for approving course syllabi. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mandel explained that course syllabi — when proposed for the first time by visiting faculty — go through a two-fold process of review by their departments and the College Curriculum Council. When courses come up for review in subsequent years, the CCC does not necessarily review their syllabi, she said. “There is an expectation at the department level that chairs are looking into syllabi. … They’re the ones with expertise.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In this instance, Kinzer’s course did not include assignments on DACA recipients when first reviewed in 2015, Mandel added. Last semester, the International Relations program — headed by Nina Tannenwald, senior lecturer in political science — approved Kinzer’s most recent syllabus. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The associate director of the IR program and I reviewed the syllabus for Stephen Kinzer’s course in 2015 (when it also had to go the CCC because it was a new course) and again last fall before he taught it this spring. We had no objections to anything on the syllabus,” Tannenwald wrote in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m open to hearing from students. … I’m not trying to defend the practice, I’m just trying to explain how we got to where we got,” Mandel said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Brown Advocates for Social Change and Equity fellowship, a program led and supported by the Office of Diversity and Multicultural Affairs at the Alpert Medical School, is in its inaugural year. The fellowship provides a framework for “med(ical) students, residents and faculty members who are interested in gaining leadership skills around issues of diversity and inclusion, but also more broadly structural racism and how that manifests in the medical system,” said Ry Garcia-Sampson MD’19, the diversity fellow at the ODMA. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The fellowship program, which was proposed last summer by Bryan Leyva MD’18, consists of three components: projects, workshops and mentoring. Eight fellows — two medical students, three faculty members and three residents — were accepted in September, Garcia-Sampson said. The fellows come from the programs in pediatrics, medicine and pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology, Garcia-Sampson said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As part of the program, each fellow has worked to create a year-long project around topics of diversity in medicine. For example, Sravanthi Puranam MD’19, BASCE fellow, decided to expand on workshops she constructed with other students surrounding health disparities in Asian-American communities, Asian-American identity and allyship. “I really applied to this fellowship so I could get some education — formal education — around how to engage and facilitate conversations about race and diversity and racial justice and why that matters,” Puranam said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since October, Garcia-Sampson has curated monthly two-hour sessions covering a variety of topics, including structural racism, race in research, race and medical education, change and action and health disparities, some of which brought in speakers from other universities and hospitals. The sessions featured aspects of presentation, discussion and workshopping the fellows’ individual projects, with the focus on addressing “racism on three levels: individual, institutional and systemic,” Garcia-Sampson said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Eric Chow, the pediatric chief resident at Hasbro Children’s Hospital and a BASCE fellow, used the fellowship to expand a project he had previously developed called “MED Talks: Medical Education through Diversity.” The project hosts a group “meant to represent patients from a community, and they talk about what it’s like to be a patient in the hospital,” Chow said. For example, members and leaders of a Jehovah’s Witness community<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>came to the hospital to share their outlook on health care, including the fact that their church doctrine does not allow blood tranfusions, he added. Chow is looking to expand his project by conducting focus groups after each session “to sit down and come up with ideas and actionable items” to improve the experiences and understandings between diverse groups and hospitals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The fellowship will continue next year, with current fellows helping to provide mentorship to make the program sustainable, Garcia-Sampson said. The projects and work of the fellows will be showcased in August, and applications for next year’s cohort will open in August as well.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I really enjoyed reading Emily Miller’s ’19 April 10 commentary on visual art on campus, “Let students leave their mark on campus art.” Student art is distributed across campus, and it’s so fantastic you may not realize it’s student art! Places where student work is permanently displayed include the Blue Room, the halls of J. Walter Wilson, the waiting rooms at Health Services and the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. </span></p>
<p class="p3">Check out galleries on campus that regularly show student art. In addition to the three student galleries in the List Art Center, there is student art shown throughout the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts, in the Lower Lobby Art Gallery in the Stephen Robert ’62 Campus Center, in the Sarah Doyle Women’s Center Gallery and in the Brown-Rhode Island School of Design literary magazines “VISIONS” and “Clerestory Journal of the Arts.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Brown Visual Art Department hosts an Open Studio night in List every year, where we invite the entire campus in to see what students are making. Our Open Studio this year is 5 to 6 p.m. on Thursday, April 26, so come and enjoy an art-filled evening!</span></p>

		<title>Editorial: Reforming the First Readings program</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/12/editorial-reforming-the-first-readings-program/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since 2007, the University has requested all its incoming first-year students to read a single book (or, in one case, watch a movie) and then discuss it in small seminars during first-year orientation. The First Readings program, as it is called, was designed to create a “shared intellectual endeavor for all beginning Brown students” and to introduce them to the “pleasures and rigors of undergraduate academic life,” according to the First Readings program’s webpage. Past selections have included the film “Oil and Water,” “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness” by Michelle Alexander and “My Beloved World” by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Last month, the University announced in a Today@Brown message that the First Readings text for the incoming class of 2022 is “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City,” by Matthew Desmond. In “Evicted,” the winner of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction, Desmond tells the story of eight families who were evicted from their homes in Milwaukee. In doing so, he offers insights into the realities of inequality, race and poverty in urban America. Selected after a lengthy deliberation process, “Evicted” — like the selections before it — has the potential to give first-years a solid opportunity to dive deeply into weighty subjects even before they get to campus and generate timely conversations about pressing issues that can unite the student body in shared reflection. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, the current structure of the First Readings program does not live up to this potential. As part of the assignment, first-years are tasked with going through the reading and writing short response papers before participating in informal seminars. But without guidance, these papers are generally perfunctory assignments that do not let students exercise their creativity or engage with the readings in innovative ways. Moreover, it is unrealistic to expect a single seminar discussion during orientation week to facilitate long-term reflections or acclimate students to academic life at Brown. After the seminar, the text is largely forgotten in the frenzy of the new semester; in fact, some of us may not even remember our First Readings assignments. Ultimately, the entire exercise feels like a compliance obligation rather than a source of meaningful dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Going forward, the University should consider reforming the First Readings program to make it a more engaging and sustained experience for first-years. To this end, it can learn from the programs operated by other institutions. Approximately 40 percent of American college orientations involve a shared reading, but several universities take the program further: Stanford, for example, assigned three hefty books, and then invited each of the authors to campus during orientation to share their views directly with students. Other schools host lecture series or events that offer different perspectives on the readings at hand. These are changes that Brown could well undertake. After all, when the University invited Justice Sotomayor to discuss “My Beloved World” in February, the talk added a new level of engagement to the First Readings initiative. Brown should continue in this vein to ensure that First Readings becomes more than just a one-off summer reading assignment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We firmly believe that the First Readings program is a valuable staple of the orientation experience, and that a revitalized version can more effectively introduce students to the intellectual mission and culture of the University. First-year students stand to benefit from getting an early taste of college-level discussions and analysis. The program can also set the tone for the upcoming year, help forge bonds between students new to campus and generate productive conversations both in and out of the classroom. Unfortunately, as it currently stands, the First Readings program feels like a box that incoming students must mindlessly check off during orientation week. We hope that this changes in the years to come.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As a member of the Brown community for the past 11 years, I have come to treasure and expect the diversity of backgrounds and perspectives that we find on our campus. It’s one of the reasons why I came back after taking time off as an undergraduate and why I again came back to Brown as a medical student. One of the most valuable lessons I have learned here is to not assume that I truly, or even partially, understand someone else’s point of view. As the son of two parents who I would describe as liberal in every sense of the word (politically, socially, religiously, etc.) and the product of a community with similar leanings, I didn’t knowingly engage with a self-identified conservative or Republican until the latter half of my time in college. Contrary to my expectations, I found that we shared a great deal of common ground. We loved our families and considered them in almost every personal decision that we made. We saw the chance to pursue higher education as one of the most valuable opportunities in a young person’s life and wanted to find ways to extend this privilege to as many others as possible. And perhaps most importantly, we both wanted to find happiness in our lives and to help others to do the same.</p>
<p class="p2">While I may share many of the political views described by Michael Froid ’21 in his <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/06/froid-21-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-irresponsible/">piece</a>, “Inviting Jeb Bush to speak is irresponsible,” I have a hard time with his reference to “policies that do not, and should not, represent the values of Brown students.” I do not believe that there are politics, positions or perspectives that define our entire student body, nor should there be. In fact, I think that diversity in these areas is what makes our campus, and ultimately our country, unique.</p>
<p class="p2">Much of my growth at Brown as a college student, a soon-to-be physician and a human being has come from having conversations with and being pushed by other students and people who see the world differently from than I do. I have learned to listen to activists explain why they think abortion is unjust and immoral, and I have learned to care for patients even when they express bigotry. Each of these moments was different and uncomfortable in its own way. I have found that these encounters often arise when you least expect them, which makes them that much more difficult and sometimes even painful when they seem to target us directly. At the same time, I am grateful that I’ve gotten to cross paths with these people and that they weren’t denied a place at Brown, in Rhode Island or in the United States because of how they voted or what they thought. I am grateful that each of these people pushed me to consider different perspectives, even when I disagreed with them.</p>
<p class="p2">I speak solely for myself here — I think that as students, we need to be pushed and to be challenged. Some of our most valuable learning comes from times when we are made to feel uncomfortable. I think that finding respect for and common ground with someone who might seem to be our complete opposite is a skill that we all could and should practice. I am grateful that we at Brown have no prerequisites for political leanings or for the values that we hold dear. The freedoms to respectfully share and speak your thoughts are parts of this community that I will always value. I believe that if we try to create a mold into which all Brown students must fit, we will risk losing them.</p>

		<title>BIRC: University should do more to support immigrant communities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On April 5, 2018, the Brown Immigrant Rights Coalition launched a campaign to gather support from students, faculty and community members to encourage the University to critically reflect on the impact of its scholarship and to commit to increasing its support of the immigrant communities within and outside our campus. The decision to launch this campaign was prompted by grievances from Providence community members over a central component in Senior Fellow in International and Public Affairs Stephen Kinzer’s class INTL 1802W: “International Journalism”, in which students were tasked with finding a person who qualifies as a “Dreamer” and with holding them as their object of study for the duration of the semester. We believe that mistakes in the design of this course could have been avoided through a more careful and informed preparation of the course. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We agree with Professor Kinzer that there needs to be more scrutiny of the immigration system of our country today and the way in which it impacts our society, and we agree that one way to go about this is through journalism. We believe responsible journalism and scholarship should be performed with a high degree of integrity and sensitivity — especially when it directly affects the most vulnerable members of our community. We are working privately with Professor Kinzer and the students in the course to ensure that this is a productive learning experience for all. We would like to work with the broader Brown community, however, to be better informed and proactive on this issue at a truly critical point in our national history. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our call to action speaks to a larger need for reform. At a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is steeply on the rise and when immigrant communities are often pointed to as scapegoats for the problems of the world today, it is more important now than ever for us to get informed and involved. We have composed a list of demands that we believe will promote and deepen the necessary dialogue on immigration that we need to be having on this campus, dialogue which will work to raise our humane and intellectual comprehension of the world. In working to meet these goals, Brown would be upholding its own values on progressing toward diversity and inclusion, and would be helping to lead the way in our nation’s understanding and discourse.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our demands are as follows:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>1. Comprehensive training for faculty and student leaders on working with undocumented people</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In order for Brown to be a campus that engages in responsible and ethical research regarding migration, and, as such, to be a campus that is hospitable to undocumented students and students from mixed-status backgrounds, we believe that it is paramount for our professors and student leaders to be well-informed about our country’s immigration laws and the increasingly multitudinous legal and social threats and obstacles that undocumented people face in the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Understanding that there are multiple undocumented students on campus and many more who come from mixed-status families, we believe campus awareness can and must grow to be cognizant of the challenges undocumented people face, so future academic work and community building on campus are sensitive to this issue and do not work to perpetuate harm against these communities.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>2. An expansion of “Pathways to Diversity and Inclusion: An Action Plan for Brown University” to explicitly consider working with undocumented students and undocumented people</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While Brown has been making strides in progressing toward its established goal of becoming a more diverse and inclusive campus, we urge the institution not to leave undocumented communities behind. The current DIAP states undocumented students, among other groups, are a focus in recruiting and supporting on this campus. But we believe that for Brown to be earnest in this effort, the plans which each academic and administrative department have to create must take into consideration how to best work with and support undocumented people. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>3. The hiring of more faculty with true expertise on the topic of migration and immigration</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If Brown is to be a leader in understanding migration, its research and scholarship produced on this topic must be impassioned and cutting-edge, and must not be parochial. Recruiting more faculty with expertise will allow for our campus understanding to develop and grow.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>4. A strong recommitment to actively recruiting and admitting undocumented students and students with Temporary Protected Status, Deferred Enforced Departure or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">College access has long been and continues to be littered with systemic obstacles and barriers for undocumented students. Recognizing this, Brown has committed to making its admissions open and equitable to these students. We ask that Brown hold itself accountable to bringing in top undocumented students from around the country for the betterment of our campus community and campus awareness.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>5. Expanding Brown’s Tam Tran memorial by creating the Tam Tran Undocumented Series and providing funds to support the Tam Tran Scholarship </i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Tam Tran was an undocumented doctoral student at Brown who was killed in a motor accident in 2010. She was passionate about advocating for immigrant rights and immigration reform, and used filmmaking as a medium to uplift the narratives of undocumented students. In honoring her life work, BIRC helped start the Tam Tran Scholarship to provide financial assistance for undocumented students in Rhode Island seeking to attend college. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Recipients of this award have asked us why Brown students keep pestering them for interviews. We do not believe this is doing right by the legacy of Tam Tran. We ask Brown to stop this practice and to focus instead on resources and attention toward programming and scholarship that honors the enduring vision of Tam Tran.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><em>John Lopez ’18.5,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maria Camila Arbelaez Solano ’19, Alexis Roman ’21, Angel Mendez ’20, Kathleen Wu ’20 and Javier Juarez GS are members of the Brown Immigrant Rights Coalition and can be reached at john_lopez-aldas@brown.edu, maria_arbelaez@brown.edu, alexis_roman@brown.edu, angel_mendez-flores@brown.edu, kathleen_wu@brown.edu and javier_juarez@brown.edu, respectively.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Andrew Yang ’96 was on College Hill, his life revolved around three activities: Taekwondo, working out and playing video games. Now, Yang directs his creative energy toward a different trifecta: automation, capitalism and the future of our nation. A little over two decades after graduating from the University and founding his own company, Venture for America, Yang is running for President of the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An economics and political science concentrator, Yang used his two areas of study to develop the core tenet of his campaign — universal basic income. If elected, the 2020 Democratic candidate promises to allocate $1,000 per month to every American between the ages of 18 and 64, which he calls a “Freedom Dividend,” according to his <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/meet-andrew/">campaign website.</a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, a majority of Americans “can’t pay a $500 bill that’s unexpected, and it’s leading to a mindset of scarcity and dysfunction in much of the country,” Yang said. “A thousand dollars a month would make a dramatic difference in the day-to-day lives of tens of millions of families.” The monthly stipend could improve childcare, domestic violence rates and mental and physical health, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yang believes universal basic income can address the same sources of frustration that fueled the election of President Donald Trump: automation and job loss. “Donald Trump is our president today because we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and other states,” he said. Automation “is no longer a future-facing conversation. We are in the middle of it, and it’s tearing us apart.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the founder of Venture for America, an organization that helps entrepreneurs create jobs in cities, Yang worked to share skills suited to a 21st century environment with recent graduates. “But along the way, it became clear to me that job creation will not outpace the massive impending job loss due to automation,” reads a statement on Yang’s website. “Those days are simply over.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yang plans to develop a new tax on the companies that benefit most from automation in order to fund his universal basic <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/meet-andrew/">income proposal.</a> With this policy change, the top 1 percent would end up contributing substantially to the U.S. economy through their purchases; these contributions would exceed the $1,000 per month they would receive under his plan, Yang said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The people who benefit most from universal basic income are the people who have the least and the least access to opportunities,” he added. “Economic justice is social justice.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A concern with universal basic income is that it would drive up the cost of many consumer goods. But Yang believes that competition between firms and technology would mitigate those effects. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Further, Yang said he has plans to address costs in industries that do not adequately self-regulate, specifically health care and education. He aims to move the nation toward a single-payer <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/single-payer-healthcare/">health care system</a>, either by expanding Medicare or by creating a new health care system. To reduce the costs of higher education, Yang’s plans explore limiting the rate at which universities that receive public funding can increase their<a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/controlling-cost-higher-education/"> costs.</a> He is also considering decreasing the administrator-student ratio that is required to receive public funding.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yang’s dreams of and designs for economic justice fall under his platform dubbed “Human Capitalism,” which prioritizes human well-being and fulfillment as opposed to the gross domestic product. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If implemented, Yang believes Human Capitalism has the potential to mitigate the opioid crisis and mass shootings, among other pressing concerns. The opioid crisis is “a disease of our current form of capitalism” where drug companies prescribe billions of dollars worth of opioids and advertise them as “wonder drug(s)” that are not addictive, Yang said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Under Human Capitalism, drug companies would internalize the cost of opioid addiction — in that case, the profit incentive would align with the social one, he added. His same vein of thought applies in the case of guns. “Right now, every time there is a shooting, gun sales go up” because people are afraid the government will take away their guns, Yang said. “Imagine if a gun manufacturer had to pay a fine every time one of their guns were used in a shooting.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yang acknowledges that his goals would best materialize with a Democratic majority in Congress. If Yang wins the election, he expects to take office with a blue majority since his election would signify a “blue wave” and “an appetite and a need for big policy changes,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prominent supporters of Yang include Andy Stern, a former leader of Service Employees International Union; Tony Hsieh, chief executive of Zappos; and several venture capitalists and former employees of Facebook and Google, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/technology/his-2020-campaign-message-the-robots-are-coming.html">New York Times reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yang credits the University with inspiring his humanist and optimistic values.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Brown instilled in me a deep sense of both social responsibility and also possibility,” he said. “This confidence that I could make a difference and make great things happen if I was well-(intentioned) and committed, and willing to put my heart and soul into it.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His work with scholars and students on College Hill has extended far beyond the Taekwondo, workouts and video games that kickstarted his journey. The University has regularly hosted Venture for America’s five-week summer training, and countless alums have already stepped up to support Yang as he campaigns for the presidency.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most of all, Yang believes that students at the University are vital to the future he envisions for the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“To anyone who is at Brown right now, please know that our country needs you very badly, and you are capable of more than you currently believe and imagine,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island House of Representatives voted 60 to eight Thursday to pass a “Red Flag” bill that would allow courts to take action against individuals who own a firearm and are considered to pose imminent danger to themselves or others. The House also voted to pass legislation (<a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText18/HouseText18/H7688Aaa.pdf">H-7075</a>) banning “bump stocks,” which are modifications to semiautomatic weapons that increase their firing rate. Both bills will now move on to the state senate. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legislation similar to the Red Flag bill is being considered by lawmakers in states across the country following the Parkland, Florida shooting, in which the gunman displayed warning signs of violence prior to the incident. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Red Flag bill “gives law enforcement the tools necessary to intervene at a very crucial time,” allowing law enforcement act quickly to disarm a potential shooter, said Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, D-Cranston, a bill co-sponsor, at the legislative session. “The professional law enforcement community” has emphasized that “this is the bill that is needed to protect everyone,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Red Flag bill enables police officers to petition for “extreme risk protection orders” to be issued against individuals exhibiting one or more of 11 different behaviors that make them a potentially active threat. Considerations would include criminal and mental health history, patterns of violence or domestic abuse and substance and alcohol abuse history. Ultimately, a judge would decide whether the petition provided “clear and convincing evidence” for a protection order to be issued. The orders would last for one year and can be renewed. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In February, Gov. Gina Raimondo passed a red flag executive order as a preliminary measure to achieve the same objectives.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The House Judiciary Committee voted 12 to zero to approve the Red Flag bill Tuesday, with two Republican members abstaining. However, the committee also made a series of major revisions in response to concerns that the Red Flag bill could infringe upon civil liberties. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The key change to the bill includes ensuring that only law enforcement would have the right to file a petition for protective orders; previously, the attorney general and family members of the person in question were also allowed to do so, according to a list of talking points provided by the Office of the Speaker of the House. Officers would be required to provide “credible evidence” sworn under oath.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The new version of the bill also stated that “unlawful, threatening or reckless use or brandishing of a firearm” in social media posts could serve as grounds for a judge to grant an order. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many of the changes came in response to a 14-page report released by the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union in March. The report warned that the Red Flag bill could set a precedent for law enforcement and courts to violate civil rights without adequate due process.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When you are dealing with legislation, the devil is always in the details,” said Steven Brown, director of Rhode Island’s ACLU. “The danger is that (the Red Flag bill) ends up getting used for purposes that it was never intended to be used for. There are provisions in the bill that authorize action against individuals based on very vague and open-ended standards.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to the ACLU’s report, the bill’s broad scope could be used as a pretext for police to remove lawfully owned weapons from alleged gang members or people using “overblown political rhetoric” on social media. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moreover, when police are tasked with exercising significant discretion, that power is often used disproportionately against marginalized groups, Brown said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The ACLU also called into question the duration of the protective orders; the fact that courts could compel individuals to engage in mental health evaluations, or else face contempt of court; and the bill’s loose definition of “imminent danger.” Individuals with criminal backgrounds or histories of mental health issues without a record of recent violence could still face protective orders if a judge determines that they pose an imminent and “significant” danger. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The bill places judges in the unenviable — indeed, impossible — position of trying to predict who may and may not become a mass murderer,” the ACLU report noted. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence has not endorsed the Red Flag bill, according to Katherine Kerwin, director of communications for the coalition.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Larry Berman, director of communications for the Office of the Speaker, Mattiello and the Red Flag bill’s other sponsors reviewed similar legislation from other states like California and Oregon. They also consulted extensively with state agencies to make adjustments prior to Thursday’s vote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The revised bill now requires the court to review protective orders within 30 days of their issue and for individuals to be given access to a public defender. There would also be the opportunity to submit a written request for appeal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition, measures have been taken to guard against intentional false reporting. The penalty for filing a petition for a protective order in “bad faith” would lead to fines of $5,000 and up to five years of imprisonment. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But for some legislators, these changes to the Red Flag bill were not sufficient to mitigate due process concerns. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We should be taking guns from people who should not have them. I think everyone agrees with that — the question is, how do we do it?” said House Minority Whip Blake Filippi, R-Block Island. “I don’t think this bill respects the process (that) is necessary to take away someone’s fundamental right.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nevertheless, proponents of the bill place a premium on the number of lives it could save. Rep. Teresa Tanzi, D-Narragansett, emphasized the bill’s role in suicide prevention. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Nine out of 10 people who attempt suicide and do not complete suicide go on to never attempt again,” Tanzi said. “Now, those who attempt suicide with a handgun — nine out of ten of those individuals do not survive. … You take the gun out of the equation, (they would) go on to live full, productive, happy lives.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Approximately 70 supporters of Moms Demand Action, an organization advocating gun control that helped develop the Red Flag bill, formed a visible presence at the legislative session. Sitting in bright red shirts in the wings of the house, they clapped quietly when the bill was passed. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I joined Moms after (the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting); I lived in that area, and it just destroyed me,” said Barbara Swanson of Narragansett, a survivor engagement leader responsible for coordinating with survivors of shootings to advocate for gun control. “But for some reason, Parkland destroyed me worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I have grandchildren; I don’t want them to live in a violent society,” she added. “We have a second amendment, but with rights come responsibilities.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">— <i>Additional reporting by Sophie Culpepper</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The University announced on Thursday its plan to begin a multi-million dollar renovation to the infrastructure of the Sharpe Refectory this summer with the goal to permanently equip it with cooling abilities in summer 2019. This decision arrives amid a sustained campaign organized by students and dining workers to introduce air conditioning in the Ratty.</p>
<p class="p5"><b>The University’s Plan </b></p>
<p class="p6">The efforts to construct a cooling solution in the Ratty will be structured as a two-fold process with the University beginning to work on the first phase in June, said Barbara Chernow, executive vice president for finance and administration. This first phase includes upgrades and improvements to fixtures in the Ratty’s interior such as its electrical system and backup generator, as well as its air handling fans and controls in the attic, she added. Altogether, the phase will cost $4 million and will take place from June to December of this year.</p>
<p class="p6">The University secured the funding for these renovations in spring 2017, Chernow added.</p>
<p class="p6">The second phase of the process will focus on creating “permanent cooling solutions” for the facility, she said. It begins with a feasibility report, which is currently underway, that will assess the costs and form of cooling that will be introduced in the Ratty. “The goal is that by next summer or the fall, we would have a more permanent solution ... of permanent cooling,” she added.</p>
<p class="p5"><b>An Ongoing Campaign for Ratty A/C</b></p>
<p class="p6">The University’s announcement comes after campaigning from students ­­— led by the Student Labor Alliance — and dining workers for the installation of air conditioning in the Ratty’s kitchen to address a reported issue with high temperatures. The SLA built off previous organizing done by Summer@Brown resident advisors last summer, said Evan Lehmann ’19, a member of the SLA.</p>
<p class="p6">“It’s clear that (air conditioning) would solve the issue. … People who work in the Ratty have been asking for A/C over and over again,” said Sammie Chomsky ’18.5, a member of the SLA.</p>
<p class="p6">The other dining hall on campus, the Verney-Woolley Dining Hall, has air conditioning, said Peter Rossi, director of Dining Services.</p>
<p class="p6">An employee from Brown Dining Services who worked in the Ratty during the summer told The Herald that members of the Ratty’s staff had previously asked for the installation of a cooling system, but the administration was unable to accommodate their requests due to the building’s age and structure. “We’ve been struggling there for so many years,” said the employee, who requested anonymity to protect their job.</p>
<p class="p6">The University installed temporary cooling towers in the Ratty’s kitchens in summer 2017 to alleviate the severity of the heat, said Emma Galvin ’18.5, a member of the SLA and an organizer for the campaign. But the employee from Dining Services said that though the units “helped for a little while, … you’d have to be close to it, which you can’t (do because) … you have to move around” on the job.</p>
<p class="p6">“In installing the cooling towers, (the administration) did act on the issue, but it didn’t solve the problem,” Chomsky said.</p>
<p class="p6">During the same summer, the University also created hydration stations and air-conditioned break rooms. Employees were allowed more frequent breaks and lighter uniforms to mitigate some of the heat’s effects, Rossi said.</p>
<p class="p6">These temporary changes helped to reduce the kitchen’s overall temperature by seven to nine degrees ­— causing it to hover between 70 and 80 degrees — though some spaces, such as the grilling areas, remained warmer, Chernow said.</p>
<p class="p6">However, these measures were insuffient to totally relieve the effects of working in the heat, the employee said. “People ha(d) to go and sit in the side room that has A/C. That doesn’t help because … you sit for like five minutes, and then you go out again and you’re still going to be in that heat,” they said.</p>
<p class="p6">The employee added that they continued to feel fatigued even after leaving their shift in the kitchen. “When I go home, I don’t want to do (anything), even if my kids talk to me. I’m so tired and frustrated that I take it out on my kids. It’s not great,” they said.</p>
<p class="p6">Employees would use their sick days to avoid working in the highest temperatures, and female employees in the Ratty would often complete their shifts without going to the bathroom, as their pants would cling to their skin from sweat, they added.</p>
<p class="p6">Another employee, who also requested anonymity for job protection, confirmed these claims. She added that “the pants (that) they give us: The material is (a) cheap, polyester type. … It’ll take you forever to pull them up … (or) down because your thighs and your legs are all wet.”</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Other employees have reported getting sick and feeling faint from the heat, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/13/dining-services-gets-heat-lack-ac-ratty/">The Herald previously reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p6">But the University contests these claims. “We do not have reports or evidence of people coming to the University (and) saying that they fainted or (had) gotten sick on the job … due to heat,” said Brian Clark, director of news and editorial development.</p>
<p class="p6">“There weren’t people fainting left and right,” he added.</p>
<p class="p6">“We’re fully committed to the health and safety and working conditions for all of the employeees that we have on campus, whether we’re talking about dining staff who are in the Sharpe Refectory, or facilities staff who are outside in the summer or faculty and staff who are elsewhere on campus,” Clark said.</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Moving Forward</b></p>
<p class="p6">In the upcoming summer, the University intends to place temporary cooling systems in the Ratty, Clark said.</p>
<p class="p6">In addition to repeating the steps taken last summer, the University will rework the dining hall’s menu to reduce use of heat-producing machinery, Rossi said.</p>
<p class="p6">After hearing the University’s new plan, Chomsky said she would “call this a win” for the community campaign. But the campaign will continue to monitor the University’s implementation of the Ratty’s renovations through broad coalitions with workers and community meetings to keep the University accountable, she added.</p>
<p class="p6">“It’s about basic respect for people that are in our community,” Chomsky said. “The administration fails to respect that they need basic (things) like air conditioning so that they can work in an environment that’s safe. It’s about making sure that Brown is not a place that is disrespecting the dignity of the people that work there.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pessimism was not in the room when former cabinet members Tom Perez ’83, senior fellow in international and public affairs, and Gina McCarthy, former director of the environmental protection agency, discussed the legacy of the Obama administration on Thursday. The event took place in the List Art Center and was moderated by Director of the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs Ed</span>ward<span class="s1"> Steinfeld P’20. Perez and McCarthy struck a hopeful tone and drew frequent laughter from the crowd, catching some audience members by surprise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You’ve both expressed a lot of optimism today about the resiliency of the Obama legacy,” one student in attendance remarked when the discussion was opened to questions from the audience. “That was not what I came in here expecting.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perez — who served as secretary of labor in the Obama administration and currently chairs the Democratic National Committee — admitted it is disheartening to see some of his accomplishments chipped away by the Trump administration. “We’ve taken some hits at the Labor Department. Does it break my heart? Yeah. Does it strengthen my resolve? Hell yeah,” he said. “I understand that some people will feel pessimism, but we can either fret, or we can fight.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perez noted that the same sense of resolve has driven many people to stand up for their values since Trump’s election, resulting in a string of election victories for Democrats in many levels of government. “When we put hope on the ballot, we win,” Perez said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">McCarthy, who directed the EPA under the Obama administration, said that people are often surprised by her lack of pessimism. “I get the same reaction everywhere. … They think I’m just destitute, in this constant state of depression,” she joked, adding that people shouldn’t let the Trump administration “take away your energy and your enthusiasm and your hope.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the Obama legacy may seem to be under siege, McCarthy said she isn’t worried about much of her work at the EPA being undone, as the Obama administration carefully followed the rulemaking process to enact regulations that could stand up to judicial scrutiny. The Trump administration, on the other hand, “thinks that (it) can rule by executive order and that (it) can do a shoddy job of rulemaking to just confirm what the President of the United States wants,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For that reason, I don’t think that they are going to be successful in rolling back the work that we did,” McCarthy said. “They’re simply not working hard enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perez agreed that the Trump administration’s approach to deregulation has been “ham-handed” and “sloppy.” But he said he does worry for the Obama legacy, noting that some damage will need to be patched up “when we get back in control.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">McCarthy maintained that the Trump administration “is claiming success that is nowhere near the finish line” in its attempts to overturn Obama’s legacy. She expressed more concern about Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, which she thinks will delay action on climate change and damage American leadership around the world. “It’s going to take a long time, but I have to have faith that the United States is going to lead that charge again,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perez similarly expressed disappointment that the United States has been swept up in the rising tide of nativism around the world. “What we had, historically, during periods like this was the moral authority of the United States, (but) it’s not there,” he said. “The normalization of ethics violations, the normalization of lying, the normalization of misogyny — this is conduct unbecoming of a president, unbecoming of a person anywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The truth matters. Science matters. Civility matters,” Perez said. “I fear that people are going to look at (the Trump administration) and think this is okay. This is not okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">McCarthy agreed that civil discourse has taken a hit under Trump. “I worry that (the credibility of government) has eroded to a level where it’s going to take considerable time to bounce back — if it does,” she said. “I worry that … now we’re going to not only have a Congress that doesn’t work, but we’re going to have an executive branch that just undoes what the other one did.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But McCarthy has found actions taken by state and local governments to be reassuring. “Others step up at a time when Washington is asleep,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perez stressed that the United States has overcome division before. “This is a resilient democracy, and I have such faith in the American people,” he said. “We can do this, but (democracy) has to be a full-participation sport. … And the good news is I’m seeing (participation) in remarkable abundance. The energy — it’s not abating. People understand you can’t take democracy for granted any longer.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">McCarthy emphasized that she is “incredibly hopeful” for the future. “I actually see signs that people are beginning to act like they need to act, which is with passion,” she said. “I haven’t been to a march in decades before the women’s march. … If you want to see what America is, that’s what it is. … It’s endless work, but it’s worth it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Trump administration may be the first “whose sole path forward is to go backwards,” McCarthy said. But “there’s no way that I think this administration is going to take down the United States of America.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: The Angels will be a shocker playoff team</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In center field, they have the greatest player of this generation. At designated hitter, they have the greatest player of the last generation. And on the mound, they’ve got the coolest player of either. If you’re not excited about the Los Angeles Angels by now, then you must not be paying attention.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Baseball season is young, and a lot can happen in the next few months. But so far, everything we’ve heard and hoped about the Angels has come true. Mike Trout has mashed the ball, and is walking more than 10 percent of the time. Once his average returns to where it’s always been, he’ll relatively easily regain his spot as the best all-around player in baseball. Albert Pujols, in his aged wisdom, is batting .288. Andrelton Simmons, defensive wizard, is batting .365, Tyler Skaggs has pitched 16 innings in two starts and only allowed three runs and 35-year-old Jim Johnson has shown signs of resurgence, pitching to a 2.45 ERA out of the bullpen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Angels, in short, have all the characteristics of a shocker playoff team. Do they have superstars? Yes. Dependable role-players and sage veterans? Absolutely. Charisma and fun of a winner? It’s hard not to think so. And what’s more, we haven’t even touched on the Angels’ newest sensation, and America’s newest sweetheart.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When Shohei Otani allowed a single to Oakland Athletics’ shortstop Marcus Semien in the seventh inning last Sunday, it meant that he wouldn’t make major league history and become the 24th pitcher to throw a perfect game. But it’s hard to say that Otani was anything but brilliant. In his seven scoreless innings, he struck out 12 batters, and allowed only that one hit, along with a walk. This was after a week during which, despite some previous doubts about his swing, he hit home runs in three consecutive games. So far on the mound, Otani is 2-0 with a 2.08 ERA. At the plate, he’s batting .364/.417/.773 with three home runs. After Otani’s start against the Athletics, Alex Putterman of The Comeback pointed out on Twitter that Otani — in that moment — had more strikeouts than Max Scherzer and more home runs than Aaron Judge.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He was certainly impressive to baseball writers, many of whom had been less than dazzled by his mediocre spring. “He is the most exciting story in baseball and has been since opening day,” wrote the Wall Street Journal’s Jared Diamond on Twitter. “This is utter domination.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports wrote an entire column entitled, “Dear Shohei: I’m sorry. I was totally wrong about you.” Tim Brown, also of Yahoo Sports, wrote, “It’s becoming something. Maybe not a mania. … A spectacle. A curiosity. A hope.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Put it all together and what do you have? To me, it seems pretty clear. The Angels are becoming America’s team. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“America’s team” certainly isn’t a technical term, so what exactly does it mean? To give some context, the last time I can remember anything like it was during the 2014 playoffs, when baseball fans outside of San Francisco fairly unanimously rooted for the Kansas City Royals. After several dramatic victories, the Royals ultimately came up short against the Giants in the World Series. But what’s happening with the Angels is different, and far bigger. It’s easy to fall in love with a team like the Royals once the field has been narrowed down to eight or 10 in the playoffs, and most of those are hated rivals. But the Angels, with Trout and Otani and company, are on another level entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since Trout’s ascension to the major leagues in 2012, the Angels have failed to live up to the hype: They’ve made the playoffs only once, in 2014, and have only finished above .500 half the time. But this year, they’re off to a hot start. They’re 10-3, and lead the American League West by one game over reigning champions Houston Astros. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Predicting baseball is a fool’s errand — anyone can get hurt or traded, or just have a bad year. But based on the excitement we’ve seen coming from Angel Stadium, I’d pick the Angels to make the playoffs. And when they do, I’d say that most of America will be rooting for them.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NBA playoffs begin this Saturday, and the favorites of years past expect to contend for the championship once again. The Golden State Warriors, while stumbling down the stretch thanks to injuries, have the most talent by far when healthy — and star Stephen Curry should return before too long. The Cleveland Cavaliers struggled through an up-and-down season, but LeBron James remains the best player in the world and can still dominate the Eastern Conference. The Houston Rockets amassed an epic regular season with 64 wins and intend to defeat the Warriors in a possible Western Conference Finals clash. Bottom line, the vast majority of analysts will pick one of these three teams to take home the championship. But there is another team that could contend this season: the Utah Jazz.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the sports media world has not covered the Jazz to the same extent as it has the league powerhouses, Utah is on an incredible tear. On Jan. 22, the team possessed a 19-28 record — far out of playoff contention and headed for a lottery pick. Since then, the Jazz have gone 29-6 (yes, really), overwhelming the opposition with intense defense and quick offense. What changed for Utah? The return of Rudy Gobert from injury. Gobert is one of the most underappreciated players in the NBA — an annual Defensive Player of the Year threat who changes the game. Boasting a ridiculous 7’9” wingspan, Gobert protects the rim like no one else, recording 2.3 blocks per contest. He also adds verticality to Utah’s offense — always a threat for alley-oops.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, one cannot talk about the Utah Jazz without praising Donovan Mitchell. After the departure of Gordon Hayward last offseason, the Jazz were assumed to be in a rebuilding phase. But that all changed with the selection of Mitchell in the 2017 draft. The rookie has more than filled Hayward’s role on the fast track to NBA superstardom. The guard has averaged 20.5 points per game while drawing comparisons to Dwyane Wade, Russell Westbrook and a host of other elite players. He has tight handles and a speedy first step, and can attack the rim with great success or step back with a smooth crossover and jump shot. Don’t be surprised to see him dominating the playoffs over the next decade.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Jazz hold a lot of undervalued talent in addition to these two starters. Guard Ricky Rubio was heavily criticized for his failure to shoot the ball in Minnesota but has since improved in Utah, where he does not have to control the entire offense. A career 32.5 percent three-point shooter, Rubio hit on 34.9 percent of his shots outside the perimeter this season — his best mark ever. The 27-year-old made 40.2 percent of his threes after the All-Star break, as he continued to gain confidence from the outside. And many NBA fans have never heard of Joe Ingles, a small forward from Australia, but he adds important floor spacing for Mitchell. Ingles is shooting 43.9 percent from three, fifth in the league and ahead of names such as Kyle Korver, Curry and Kevin Durant. Jae Crowder struggled a lot in Cleveland but has improved since the Cavaliers trade, giving the Jazz strong defense at the wing positions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Utah can more than hang with the top teams in the league, blowing out the Warriors by an incredible 40-point margin on Tuesday night. While Golden State will surely mount a tougher fight with Curry on the floor, they should be afraid of the Jazz. After all, Utah still defeated them by 30 points back in January when Curry was playing. The Warriors and Jazz are trending in opposite ways, with Golden State playing its worst basketball in almost four years and Utah peaking at just the right time. The Jazz will still be underdogs if the two teams meet in the playoffs, but no one should underestimate their chances.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though many fans may not realize it, the Jazz have proven themselves to be a tier above the rest of the middling Western Conference playoff teams. No one in that group has mounted a hot streak even close to what Utah has accomplished, and the other teams all have significant deficiencies. The Portland Trail Blazers have too many mediocre forwards playing big minutes. The New Orleans Pelicans don’t have enough starter-level wings to pair with Anthony Davis. The San Antonio Spurs are missing Kawhi Leonard, who may not return for the playoffs, and even with Leonard on the court, San Antonio doesn’t possess enough above-average talent to make a deep push. Lastly, the Oklahoma City Thunder are inconsistent and low on depth — their bench is atrocious.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Jazz, however, are terrific in all facets of the game. They can win offensive races and defensive rock fights. A team this well-rounded and adaptable can match up with anyone. Utah has the ability to advance a lot further in the playoffs than anyone thinks.</span></p>

		<title>Seto ’18 earns second bid to Nationals</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Anna Seto ’18 delivered a strong performance for the equestrian team Saturday, collecting a pair of top two finishes in the Zone 1 Finals at Mount Holyoke College and qualifying for the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association National Championships. The qualification marks Seto’s second consecutive year riding at the highest level of collegiate competition. She finished first in the Intermediate Flat division and second in the Intermediate Fences division, both of which earned her a bid to nationals alongside teammate Dominique Carlo ’20, who qualified with a second-place finish in Walk-Trot.</span></p>
<p class="p1">For her performance, Seto has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Congratulations on qualifying for nationals! How does that feel?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">It feels really great! It’s awesome.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What divisions are offered for the team to compete in? What is your strongest?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The team is comprised of people from all different experience levels. There’s anything from Walk-Trot, which means you’ve pretty much never ridden before, to competing pretty extensively. I actually started in one of the lowest divisions, and I moved up by doing a lot of horse shows and placing out of divisions.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>How did you first get into equestrianism?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I read “The Black Stallion” in fourth grade, and I wouldn’t drop it. I love horses — I think they’re amazing. I started doing summer camp one summer, and then my parents agreed to do lessons every other week, and it progressed. I worked off a lot of riding, doing chores at the barn and things like that for riding time and lessons. I didn’t compete much in middle school and high school. It’s a really expensive sport, so that’s one thing that’s awesome about Brown. We’re varsity, so we’re funded. I didn’t think I would be able to ride in college at all, so that’s great. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Is it difficult to balance your academic and equestrian careers?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Our team commitments are weightlifting two or three times a week (and) our general team meetings. Then for our riding time, we do two lessons a week, which are three-hour time blocks. It’s different from a lot of sports, because it’s not like we show up to the barn and the whole three hours are riding — it’s a lot more of taking care of the horse, you have to brush the horse and get them ready. Our lessons are usually about an hour of riding, but in a three-hour time block to fit everything in. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What are your interests outside of riding and school?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I like reading, cooking and being outdoors in other ways. I really like hiking. I am a mechanical engineer, so the vast majority of my time is taken up with different classes and doing stuff with the team. On top of that, it’s just wherever I can find time to do something fun. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What are your plans for after graduation? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I am going to be interning over the summer at Planet Labs, which is a start-up satellite company in San Francisco. Then I’ll be coming back to Rhode Island and be working with Raytheon in the underwater and mine division in Portsmouth.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>In your opinion, what makes a good rider? What are your personal strengths? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Definitely mental control and confidence. A lot of times, people say that you win with your attitude going into the ring. I think that is something that a lot of people struggle with that I have gotten better at. Not to say that I’m perfect or anything, but improving that has been a big part of it. Also, the way we compete, we don’t know too much about the horses we are riding. It is a bit of an adaptability challenge, to be able to communicate with them and get them to do the things that you want them to do without having ridden them before. I rode a lot of lesson horses growing up. I didn’t have my own horse. Having a wide range of experience and being adaptable is super huge.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What have you enjoyed the most about being part of the equestrian team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I think that something it has really made me appreciate is actually the team concept of it. Riding is an individual sport everywhere else, other than collegiate. So having other people to support you and supporting other people is great. Having all the different levels of riders in one place is really rewarding — getting to see everyone progress, do better and learn.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Seto will compete at the IHSA National Championships beginning May 3 at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s3"><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gladstone &#039;18, Shire &#039;19: A call for civil dialogue and nuance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Earlier this week, a group called Students Supporting Israel — which has no affiliation with Brown Students for Israel or, as far as we know, with any student group on campus — tabled outside of the Stephen Robert ’62 Campus Center last Wednesday. We, as leaders of Brown Students for Israel, approached the tablers and urged them to leave. We took great issue with a number of this group’s tactics, which we found to be both counterproductive and embarrassing to the pro-Israel community. Our intention in this op-ed is both to clarify that we have no relationship with SSI and to explain some of the reasons why we found SSI’s actions this week problematic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First, it is important that we establish the facts about Wednesday’s incident. Despite the similar acronyms of SSI and BSI — Students Supporting Israel and Brown Students for Israel, respectively — the two groups are in no way related. SSI acted independently, without reaching out to BSI, and arrived on campus without our knowledge. BSI members learned of their presence at the same time as the rest of the Brown community. SSI exhibited posters that distilled very complex topics in the conversation about Palestine and Israel into simplistic slogans, and they sought to incite Brown students to anger so that they could film us for their “research.” BSI leaders were among the students whom they tried to videotape. In doing so, SSI deeply upset a number of Brown students who have, as many members of BSI do, a personal connection to the conflict between Israel and its neighbors. When BSI learned of SSI’s activities, we asked the group a number of times to leave. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From our perspective, one enormous issue with SSI’s actions on our campus this week was the group’s apparent decision not to consult with members of the Brown community before visiting. As much as outside and national groups can, and regularly do, participate in the conversation about Israel and Palestine on Brown’s campus, such groups ought to do so with the permission and facilitation of Brown students or members of the faculty. These SSI representatives lacked an understanding of Brown’s student body. They did not know how to engage with intellectually curious, justice-focused students, and they were neither prepared for nor, apparently, interested in, serious, nuanced discussions about Israeli and Palestinian history, politics, policy and current events. BSI has worked hard in the past to keep away from campus those groups, no matter their opinion on Israel, that we know will not contribute constructively to the Israel-Palestine conversation at Brown. We care deeply about the needs of students affected by the conflict on this campus, and so prioritize a productive, civil campus discourse — we are dubious that this SSI delegation shared this priority.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">BSI disagrees heavily with SSI on issues of tactics. We believe that conversations about Palestine and Israel, especially on a college campus, must be informed and thoughtful, and that they must start from a place of mutual respect among people with different perspectives and experiences. When we host events and engage in conversations, we do so with the aim of both educating ourselves and our fellow students, on the one hand, and promoting dialogue, justice and peace, on the other. In particular, it is very important to us to never generalize about Palestinians, Muslims, Arabs or any other national, ethnic, religious or racial group. As we see it, SSI aimed less to cultivate a nuanced discussion than to generate content for their video last Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, we are concerned that SSI’s provocative language has the potential to excuse attacks on Zionist or Jewish students more broadly. Over the years, Jewish students, including BSI members, have been bullied, harassed, silenced, slandered and subjected to anti-Semitism and even to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/21/anti-semitic-homophobic-vandalism-found-in-marcy-house/">threats of violence</a> on College Hill. We also worry that Israel-Palestine discourse on campus tends to become uncivil. In recent years, we’ve heard anti-Zionist students express the view that incivility on their part is excusable on the grounds that there exists a power imbalance between Israel and Palestine. However, those claims do not adequately account for both the broader regional and historical context of the conflict between Israel and its neighbors and a host of other (often existential) threats and fail to recognize the very real losses that Zionist students have experienced on this campus — some of us have lost friends and relatives to the conflict, and most of us have family in the line of the fire.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For our part, BSI members commit to working hard to promote a high standard of respectful discourse. We seek a solution that accommodates the needs of both Israelis and Palestinians. When we see members of the pro-Israel community, even those who are not Brown students and with whom we are not affiliated, behaving in ways that do not meet that standard, we are, frankly, embarrassed, and we worry that it undermines our requests for civil treatment by anti-Zionists.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That is why the leaders of Brown Students for Israel would like to extend a formal invitation to any member of the Brown community interested in serious discussion about Palestine, Israel or other issues related to Southwest Asia or Zionist or Jewish peoplehood to reach out to us. If you would like to further this conversation, we invite you to contact us. The setting for nuanced and intellectually rigorous conversations is not at the intersection of Brown St. and Waterman. Whether you are interested in Zionist organizing or are grappling with the issues, whether you are curious to learn more about Israel and the conflict or would like to share your critiques of Israel and Israeli policy, we want to engage with you.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think most Brown students agree that while everyone is entitled to an opinion, not everyone is entitled to a platform to present those opinions; when we create space for certain people and groups to speak, we implicitly give their ideas some minimum level of legitimacy. To be clear, by inviting someone to speak, we are not necessarily endorsing their ideas or agreeing with them, but we are agreeing that they have something of value to say. Therefore, like many on this campus, I believe that Brown should not invite trolls like Milo Yiannopoulos, or white supremacist “academics” like Charles Murray to speak, as their opinions are truly abhorrent. Yet we absolutely cannot apply this argument blindly to everyone we disagree with, and instead must foster a healthy and robust debate about where we draw the line on acceptable discourse. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last Friday, The Herald published an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/06/froid-21-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-irresponsible/">op-ed</a> by Michael Froid ’21 arguing that Jeb Bush’s opinions were so out of line, so indefensible, that he does not deserve a platform to speak at Brown. In response, Mark Liang ’19 wrote a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/09/liang-19-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-responsible/">column</a> published last Monday, arguing that as a major presidential candidate, Jeb Bush is well within the lines of mainstream American discourse, and his views, though not popular at Brown, are widely shared throughout America. At the end of the day, completely dismissing Bush’s views as unworthy of discussion, as outside the realm of debate, weakens our education and undermines our ability to effect positive change in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, deciding which individuals are worthy of speaking at Brown is not always an easy, clear-cut exercise. For example, what if President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence were invited to speak at Brown? I don’t have an immediate answer. As such, I would like to start a discussion and begin to build a framework to help us, as a community, determine the parameters of acceptable discourse. To do so, we must answer two fundamental questions: What value does a potential speaker bring to the table, and how should our community’s values inform the sorts of views we seek out?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To answer the first question, we must consider why we invite guest speakers in the first place. Essentially, how can guest speakers contribute to our education? Generally, guest speakers are able to share personal experiences and new perspectives that we cannot readily find in the library, on the internet or from our professors. This includes visiting professors presenting fresh research and new ideas, professionals at the top of their fields or those with unusual professional and life experiences — like running for president. Froid maintained that Bush doesn’t have anything valuable to say, as “Someone who will mislead the public about the facts surrounding the climate … should not be treated as a credible source of information on other subjects either.” While speakers should ideally have an understanding of basic facts, this isn’t actually a prerequisite. Instead, we must consider what speakers can teach us that we won’t easily find somewhere else at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Secondly, we must consider how our University’s values should influence the types of speakers we choose to host. To be clear, by “University’s values” I do not mean values that the majority of people at Brown share. Instead, these are values that Brown has developed over time as a community — that we, as students, accepted when we decided to come here. The University’s primary objective, as articulated in its <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/mission">mission statement</a>, “is to serve the community, the nation, and the world by discovering, communicating, and preserving knowledge and understanding in a spirit of free inquiry.” Further evidence of Brown’s values can be found within the University’s <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/sites/brown.edu.academics.college.degree/files/uploads/Lib-Learning-Goals_0.pdf">Liberal Learning goals</a>, which include concrete skills like speaking, writing and scientific inquiry, as well as more abstract goals like embracing diversity and engaging with our communities. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University’s goals and values aren’t exclusive to one political party or ideology, and if we decide they are, we are severely limiting our education. Inherent to the values held by the University are respect and empathy — the belief that, while there is no room for hateful ideas on this campus, we have a responsibility to listen to others and engage with the world around us. If our goal is ultimately to “serve the community, the nation and the world,” we must understand and ultimately be able to work with people who hold opinions and viewpoints drastically different from our own. Therefore, exposure to a vast array of perspectives is a crucial aspect of an effective education, even if it sometimes makes us uncomfortable. Already, Brown tends to present primarily liberal ideas: A recent study by the SPEAK student coalition revealed that <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/05/study-finds-most-hosted-speakers-lean-left-politically/">94.5 percent</a> of hosted speakers at Brown lean left. And while we should absolutely think critically about whose views we legitimize when inviting guest speakers, if we dismiss mainstream views on the right as completely unjustifiable and illegitimate, we are further distancing our education from reality. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When done right, inviting a diverse selection of guest speakers to campus has the potential to add significant value to our education. Yet the current firestorm surrounding Bush’s impending speech has exposed a lack of clear and accepted standards for inviting speakers to Brown. Going forward, we must continue to have deliberate, honest and inclusive conversations to further clarify our University’s values and how guest speakers can contribute to our education. </span></p>
