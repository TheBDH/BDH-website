		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While most Brown students enjoyed a well-deserved respite from College Hill this winter break, the men’s basketball team bunkered down in the Pizzitola Center to prepare for a packed schedule and the beginning of conference play. The Bears (10-9, 1-2 Ivy) returned Dec. 26 for 6 p.m. practice, and it has been business as usual ever since with players grinding out two-a-days on the hard court, watching hours of film and hitting the weight room.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This training cycle, informally dubbed “intersession” by many winter sports teams, also featured a number of games. Bruno had three non-conference matchups versus Quinnipiac, Stony Brook and New Jersey Institute of Technology, as well as contests against its first three Ivy League opponents of the year: Princeton, Penn and Yale. The team went 2-4 over this stretch, with victories over Quinnipiac (8-12, 5-5 MAAC) Dec. 29 and the Quakers (7-9, 0-3) Jan. 14 to close out winter break play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reflecting on the winter break, team co-captain Tavon Blackmon ’17 said from a team chemistry standpoint, it was a great opportunity to “just grow closer together by spending so much time practicing with no one else on campus.” The senior guard also added that the Bears gained valuable in-game experience along the way. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We played some pretty good teams over winter break,” Blackmon said. “I think it’s really going to help us moving forward with league play.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Head Coach Mike Martin ’04 added that intersession helped the team pinpoint not only its strengths but also its areas of improvement. In the team’s convincing 82-70 victory over Penn, Martin said that Bruno focused on “taking care of the ball for the full 40 minutes” and “played a complete game.” In the contest, Brown took the lead with 11:43 remaining in the first half and never looked back, topping the Quakers in rebounds, fastbreak points and field goal percentage en route to their first Ivy League win of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Martin also noted that the team’s main weakness is its lack of size. To compensate, “high offensive productivity and speed on offense” have been important assets that the team has focused on so far, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One area of near certainty for the head coach has been faith in co-captain Steven Speith ’17, who “has been playing at an extremely high level,” Martin added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Speith leads the team in points per game with 15.3 and 33 minutes per game over the Bears’ last six outings during the winter break stretch. In Bruno’s nail-biting 75-74 loss to Yale (10-6, 2-1 Ivy) this past weekend, Speith had a career-high 33 points, including a clutch three-pointer to tie the game at 74 with just seven seconds remaining — his seventh trey of the game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“First and foremost, people are overlooking us,” Blackmon said. “Before the season we were picked eighth in the league. It was a big thing to show everybody we are a lot better than that. We are a small team, but we have a lot of guys doing a lot of different things, so being unselfish was one of the huge themes. We have really used that to our advantage throughout the season.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By the numbers, these efforts have definitely borne fruit so far. Brown capped non-conference play one win away from the highest winning preseason in Brown men’s basketball history, forward Travis Fuller ’19 said. This achievement comes after the team graduated Ivy basketball blocks leader Cedric Kuakumensah ’16 last spring.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Cedric was a huge part of our success,” Fuller said. “He was such a great leader and a three year captain, … but losing him is a little easier when you have three seniors to take his spot. They have done such a great job and are definitely lead-by-example type guys.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Blackmon also added that the team benefitted from offensive contributions from its bench and that first-years Brandon Anderson ’20 and Joshua Howard ’20 have played “big minutes” for the team. In Bruno’s tight 92-89 loss to Stony Brook, Anderson started at guard and notched 18 points in 23 minutes of play, including three three-pointers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moving forward, Brown will face Yale Friday at 8 p.m. in a rematch of last weekend’s thriller. After an upcoming three-game road stretch, six of the team’s last seven games are at home, which will be advantageous if the Bears can rally similar Pizzitola-filling crowds to the student turnout against Yale this past Saturday. Changes to the Ivy League postseason — the introduction of a four-team tournament that decides the Ivy’s representative in the NCAA tournament — will give Brown a unique opportunity to continue its season with more and more wins. “Brown basketball is back. We had the gym rocking,” Fuller said, adding that it was great to have “tons of support,” especially as the team will only face conference opponents from here on out as it vies for a spot in the inaugural four-team Ivy League Tournament at the Palestra.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Back in December, I predicted that the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, when it released the results of its Hall of Fame voting Jan. 18, would “somehow screw it up.” As I watched the results come in, I was pleasantly surprised at the inductees, but vaguely annoyed at the predictable, yet no less frustrating, rejects.</p>
<p class="p2">First, the inductees. Surprising as it may be, the voters did an excellent job by finally electing Jeff Bagwell and Tim Raines, and inducting Ivan Rodriguez in his first year on the ballot. Some will bicker over Rodriguez’s first-ballot selection — “he’s not a first-ballot guy.” I give the argument little credence.</p>
<p class="p2">Similarly, there are justifiable complaints to make about the exclusion of Trevor Hoffman and Vladimir Guerrero. Hoffman’s 601 career saves, while statistically meaningless, should be worth something, and Guerrero’s career .318/.379/.553 slash line and 449 home runs, without any murmurs of steroid use, should be worth even more. But again, their omissions are no crime: both received over 70 percent of the vote, and will almost certainly be inducted next year.</p>
<p class="p2">So the BBWAA did its job and inducted three fine candidates, which explained my pleasant surprise as I watched the results unveiled. But as always with the BBWAA, there remained an undercurrent of frustration. As many players as there are that deserve induction, they can not — or will not — all get elected, so long as the BBWAA continues to operate in its current, antiquated form. As the ballot was revealed and many deserving Hall of Famers remained stuck in no-man’s land, I raised a metaphorical toast to these players.</p>
<p class="p2">Here’s to Edgar Martinez, still unelected because he was a designated hitter. He was one of the most feared hitters of his generation, and statistical experts are in near-unanimous agreement on his deserving enshrinement in Cooperstown, New York. The voters, on the other hand, are not. What does this say about their grasp of statistics?</p>
<p class="p2">Here’s to Larry Walker, whose 72.6 career Wins Above Replacement should merit a spot on their own. Walker’s OPS+, a metric measuring offensive output, is better than Jeff Bagwell’s, who received 86.2 percent of the vote. So why not Walker? Because he played at mile-high Coors Field, probably. The voters must not have examined his home/road splits — or else must think that the stadium he played in is cause enough to deny induction.</p>
<p class="p2">Here’s to Fred McGriff, whose 493 home runs during the steroid era — without suspicion of performance enhancing drug use — are impressive enough on their own, without the career .377 On-Base Percentage. McGriff has been stuck near 20 percent of the vote since he hit the ballot. That is a shame.</p>
<p class="p2">And, of course, here’s to Billy Wagner. By all available measures, Wagner is one of the greatest closers of all time. Among relief pitchers with at least 500 career innings pitched, Wagner has the second-lowest<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>earned run average of all-time behind only Mariano Rivera. He has the second-best earned-runs-average-plus (an adjusted, improved version of ERA) of all time, behind — again — only Rivera. He’s also tied for second all-time in walks plus hits by innings pitched and strikeout rate. Voters, looking at Billy Wagner, see his 422 career saves, and compare the total to Trevor Hoffman’s 601. But the save statistic, again, is meaningless. The voters’ comparative ignorance of statistical reality has already been established, but it’s especially frustrating when it keeps Billy Wagner not only out of the Hall of Fame, but also at only 10 percent of the vote.</p>
<p class="p2">There are others, of course — Mike Mussina and Curt Schilling come immediately to mind. Schilling’s support actually dropped from last year’s ballot, while most other candidates saw their support rise. Statistically, Schilling’s case is borderline. His drop in support is almost definitely attributable to his run-ins on social media (that resulted in his firing from ESPN), including tweeting a picture of a t-shirt bearing the words, “rope, tree, journalist. Some assembly required” — not a good idea when one’s candidacy is being voted on by a group of journalists.</p>
<p class="p2">Mussina, meanwhile, is a victim of the steroid era. While traditional statistics like a 3.68 ERA paint a picture of a slightly above-average pitcher, Mussina’s ERA+ of 123 and his career 82.7 WAR show a different pitcher: one who, for the era during which he pitched, was as good as or better than Juan Marichal, Bob Feller and Don Drysdale — all Hall of Famers.</p>
<p class="p2">The cases of Mussina and Schilling are borderline. The cases of Walker, Wagner and Martinez seem less so. Either way, all of these players have, in one way or another, been passed over by the BBWAA for entirely the wrong reasons.</p>
<p class="p2">So here’s to the Hall of Famers waiting at the bottom of the ballot. Here’s to the players who displayed greatness on the field, whether voters who seem no longer to understand the game noticed it or not. And here’s to their greatness one day being deservingly recognized.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While most members of the student body were scattered around the world for winter break, the women’s basketball team (11-5, 2-1 Ivy) remained hard at work, resulting in some important wins.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Without the distraction of classes and often training two to three times per day, the team posted a 5-2 record over winter break. Over this period, Bruno scored an average of 77.7 points per game while holding their opponents to 71.1. The break was highlighted by the team’s first win over conference rival Princeton in 13 years, as the Bears exploded for nearly triple digits.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The action started with an 80-71 win at home over Saint Peter’s University (3-16, 2-8 MAAC), extending Bruno’s winning streak to five games.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The Bears then traveled to play Virginia Commonwealth University (11-10, 4-4 A10), and their winning streak was snapped in an 85-72 loss to the Rams.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> But Brown bounced back with a 68-51 win over Morgan State University (2-17, 0-6 MEAC), followed by a 90-44 trouncing of Rhode Island College (5-13, 2-6 LEC) in their final test before Ivy League play. Justine Gaziano ’20 scored 30 points in the victory over RIC.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Gaziano, Shayna Mehta ’19 and Taylor Will ’19 provided much of the offensive firepower throughout this stretch. They all eclipsed double-digit points in each of the four games leading up to conference play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Because of changes to the Ivy League’s postseason, the importance of each game has ramped up. The 2016-17 season marks the inaugural year of the Ivy League Tournament, a two-day, season-capping clash at the Palestra in Philadelphia, held as a tournament between the top four teams in the conference standings. The champion earns an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I Women’s Basketball Championship. This year, Brown has made reaching the Ivy League Tournament a goal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “We take every Ivy game as a Super Bowl … and we’re really focused on improving from last year and trying to be at the Palestra in March,” said Head Coach Sarah Behn.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Brown traveled to Princeton (7-9, 1-2) to open Ivy League play. There, Bruno unleashed an offensive whirlwind, dropping 98 points on the Tigers, highlighted by 33 points from Gaziano — her second straight 30-plus point performance. Brown returned home with a 98-88 win, the first time the Bears have beaten Princeton in 13 years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Since the matchup against Saint Peter’s — Gaziano’s first game back after dislocating her right thumb against Bryant University a month earlier — the first-year has been prolific. She has contributed 14, 16, 19, 30, 33, 24 and 17 points in her last seven games, and is scoring an Ivy League second-best 19.2 points per game while leading the conference in shooting percentage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> While she was initially discouraged by her injury, Gaziano said she stayed motivated by staying in shape and focusing on ball handling with her left hand. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I got my head up and knew I would be back with my teammates soon enough,” Gaziano added. “I decided to look at the positives of the situation because it could’ve been worse … I knew I had to be resilient.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> While a younger member of the squad, Gaziano has already gained the trust of her teammates. Captain Megan Reilly ’18 said that if she were to close her eyes on a fast break and blindly chuck the ball down court, Gaziano would be there to convert the opportunity. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“She is an unbelievable player,” Reilly said.“I’m honored to be her teammate.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> For her back-to-back 30-point efforts, Gaziano was named Ivy League Rookie of the Week as well as the U.S. Basketball Writers Association Women’s National Freshman of the Week. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next day, Bruno suffered a tough 86-60 loss to Ivy League-leading Penn (9-6, 3-0) in Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After a strong first half, Bruno held on for a 76-73 victory over Yale (9-7, 0-3) in their third and last conference tilt over the break. Mehta scored 20 points on 63.6 percent shooting, grabbed seven rebounds and added three assists. She was recognized as the Ivy League Co-Player of the Week for her performance. The win left them fourth in the Ivy League.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> While Brown has scored the most points per game in the Ivy League at 74.4, it fares worst in the conference in points allowed, giving up 68.4 per contest. This high scoring, fast paced offense is consistent with Behn’s preferred style of play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “You can probably tell from some of our scores: We like to run,” Behn said, adding that the fast-paced offense suits the team’s personnel, but they need to get stops on the defensive end. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mehta, who averages 14.7 points per game, thrives in her coach’s system. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We love to run the ball … we love to push it up court and shoot quickly and just tire the other team out,” Mehta<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Having notched a win in 11 of its last 13 contests, Brown brings its potent offense to New Haven to take on Yale Friday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s hockey team continued its season over the winter break, picking up one victory, one draw and five losses, to drop to a record of 4-14-1 and 3-9-0 in ECAC play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears travelled to Arizona late December for two contests in the Desert Hockey Classic tournament, in which they finished in second place. After three periods of play in the tournament’s opening matchup against host Arizona State (9-17-2), the teams were deadlocked in an 8-8 draw. Max Willman ’18 secured Bruno a spot in the title game with a 3-on-3 goal in double overtime. “Everything just seemed to find the back of the net,” said Charlie Corcoran ’18, who recorded his first career hat trick in the contest, leading the Bears with four goals. “I don’t think we played a great game defensively, but … by scoring eight goals it gave our forwards a lot of confidence,” he said. Corcoran was named ECAC Player of the Week for his efforts in the matchup.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next day, Bruno was unable to maintain an early lead against the UConn (9-10-6, 5-6-2 Hockey East) in the tournament’s championship game. After a first period goal from Tyler Bird ’18, the Huskies dominated offensive play in the second and third stanzas, sending three consecutive shots past netminder Gavin Nieto ’20. UConn added an empty-net goal on the power play in the last frame to bring the score to 4-1, edging out the Bears for the title. The Huskies outshot Bruno 34-16 in the contest. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following weekend saw Bruno return to home ice in a non-conference matchup against New Hampshire (11-9-4, 6-3-3). Though the Bears posted a late comeback in the third period by notching three consecutive goals in the final 10 minutes, they were unable to recover from an early deficit and fell to the Wildcats by a tally of 7-4. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We need to work on moving forward and being ready for that opening faceoff and not waiting to settle into the game,” Willman said. Against the Wildcats, Willman picked up three points, scoring two goals and recording one assist. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It is good to see that we can come back and score some goals, but at the same time we don’t want to put ourselves in that situation too often,” Corcoran said. “Getting down in those holes because we aren’t playing well defensively or because we have mental lapses in turning the puck over is not something that we can really afford.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following weekend, Bruno resumed conference play with a close matchup against No. 16/15 St. Lawrence (13-7-6, 9-2-3). The Bears entered the third period with a 1-0 advantage, but conceded two consecutive goals to the Saints in a losing effort. Zack Pryzbek ’17 sent a shot past Saints netminder Kyle Hayton in the second stanza for Bruno’s only score of the evening, while Andrew Doane ’17 and Max Gottlieb ’19 recorded assists on the play. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day’s contest against Clarkson (11-10-4, 6-5-2) proved difficult for the Bears. Brown entered the third period trailing 5-0, eventually falling by a score of 7-2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bird and Samuel Lafferty ’18 scored one goal apiece in the final 20 minutes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno finished the next weekend’s Ivy League double-header with mixed results. Friday night, No. 6 Harvard (12-5-2, 8-4-2) blanked the Bears in Cambridge, sending two shots past Nieto before posting an empty netter late in the third period for a 3-0 victory. Nieto made a career-high 39 saves in the contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I thought we played them hard and played them tough, but didn’t get the result we wanted,” Willman said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears found success against Dartmouth (7-10-3, 4-7-2) Saturday, mounting a comeback from a two-goal deficit in the first frame. Brent Beaudoin ’20, Davey Middleton ’17 and Willman each posted goals for Bruno in regulation, and the game concluded in a 3-3 draw. Doane secured the Bears’ victory halfway through overtime, sending a shot past Big Green netminder Devin Buffalo off a rebound.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I thought we took a step in the right direction this weekend,” Willman said. “We got a nice (overtime) win there, which … hopefully helps turn around the rest of the year for us.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown’s final 10 games will all come against ECAC opponents. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s an exciting time of the year, knowing that we still have all these teams to play,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “I think it’s just a matter of showing up ready to compete,” Corcoran said. ”We’re very optimistic and ready for the challenge.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno will host the home leg of a double-header against Yale tonight at 7 p.m.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at Meehan Auditorium. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The stage is set for Super Bowl LI as the Patriots return to Houston to take on relative newcomers — the Atlanta Falcons. While ESPN, NBC and other news outlets that cater to the lowest common denominator reserve the spotlight for superstars, the Patriots have played the entire second half of the season with only one player who would qualify as such: Tom Brady. Though the Patriots’ mantra “do your job” has now become cliche, the players, with small salaries and small egos, have shown an uncanny ability to embody this slogan.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bill Belichick set the tone for this team in the offseason when he traded Chandler Jones to the Arizona Cardinals. Jones had achieved star status during his four-year tenure with the Patriots by becoming a force at linebacker with an innate ability to rush the quarterback and cause turnovers. Belichick saw more value in what Jones was worth in return and traded him for guard Jonathan Cooper and a second-round pick. The Patriots then proceeded to trade that pick for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>third- and fourth-round picks, materializing in the form of lineman Joe Thuney and receiver Malcolm Mitchell. Thuney has been a constant on the line during his rookie season, playing 1,259 of 1,264 possible snaps, while Mitchell has become a reliable target for Brady, catching 26 passes for four touchdowns in the last eight games of the season. In Jones’ absence, the Patriots’ defense remained stout and surrendered the fewest points in the NFL this season.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The franchise’s 2000 era teams are often compared to the Yankees teams from 1995 to 2009 because of their extended dominance in their division. The key difference between the Patriots and Yankees is how their teams are composed. The Yankees, especially in the 2000s, were known for having the highest payroll in baseball and used their cash to sign a slew of stars, such as David Wells, Roger Clemens and Alex Rodriguez. The Patriots have taken the opposite approach, as is necessary in the salary-capped NFL. The coaching staff, led by Belichick, finds players who do not demand money or fame in order to keep each week’s focus on the team’s success rather than on a sideshow created by mouthy players or contract negotiations. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the Patriots, players like Matt Lengel, Shea McClellin and James Develin ’10 play just as important a role as the stars of the team. The lesser-known but hard-working and multifaceted players are invaluable to the schemes and looks that the Patriots use to torment their opponents. They leave open the option of receiving a pass or forcing a turnover, while distracting the opponent’s attention from the most important factors of the play. For example, in Week 15 against the Denver Broncos, the Patriots often used Develin as a decoy when Von Miller, one of Denver’s best defensive players, dropped back into coverage, forcing Miller to cover Develin and leave another Patriot open. In a play in the same game, the Patriots positioned Lengel and LeGarrette Blount out wide. This matched the two against Denver’s dangerous safeties, Aqib Talib and Chris Harris, while Julian Edelman lined up in the slot against a linebacker and caught an easy pass for a first down. These under-recognized Patriots are indispensable to the team because they are able to execute in a variety of situations, keeping New England’s opponents on their heels, second guessing their every move.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Patriots’ coaching staff has a great strength when it comes to valuing players and have had success signing cast-offs other teams had given up on. Signing these players instead of overpaid crybabies like Terrell Owens and Odell Beckham Jr. (both of whom have actually cried on camera) prevents outrageous media distractions and keeps focus on the entire team. Just as Chris Hogan emerged as a key player in the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, look out for other behind-the-scenes Patriots to be instrumental in the Super Bowl against Atlanta.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">After a nail-biting 75-74 defeat to Yale last week, the men’s basketball team headed into its fourth Ivy League matchup of the season Friday — a rematch against the Bulldogs (11-6, 3-1 Ivy). The Bears (10-10, 1-3) came into the game looking to avenge their previous loss and build momentum before a tough two-game road trip. But despite holding a ten-point lead midway through the second half, Bruno let the game slip away down the stretch and fell 85-75.</p>
<p class="p4">“We were pretty hyped,” said starting forward Travis Fuller ’19. “We lost the week before, and so we really wanted this one. We were mentally prepared, and we had a good week of practice leading up to it, so we were definitely ready.”</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno started the game off strong. In the first five minutes, starting forward and co-captain Steven Spieth ’17 sunk a pair of threes, grabbed two rebounds and dished an assist to first-year starter Brandon Anderson ’20 to help the Bears take an early 12-7 lead.</p>
<p class="p4">But the Bulldogs fought back. In just two minutes, an offensive surge — fueled by seven points from Anthony Dallier — capped a 12-2 run for Yale that resulted in a 19-14 Bulldogs lead with 11:34 to go in the first half. Bruno committed three turnovers during the run.</p>
<p class="p4">“Early on we were solid,” said point guard co-captain Tavon Blackmon ’17. “We were going back-and-forth and a lot of their points were off making very small, minor mistakes. But I think our offense was flowing. It was really intense from the tip.”</p>
<p class="p4">After a 30-second timeout called by Head Coach Mike Martin ’04, the Bears regrouped. Bruno mounted a comeback to tie the game at 29 after a three by co-captain JR Hobbie ’17 and then tooka 37-35 lead with just 1:37 remaining in the half after a layup by Obi Okolie ’19. By the halftime whistle, the Bears led 40-39.</p>
<p class="p4">“In our heads we were thinking back to the week before,” Fuller said. “Last week, we were up twelve at halftime, and they came back right away so this time we wanted to just finish things out.”</p>
<p class="p4">Brown continued its momentum to start the second half. In the first seven minutes, Bruno built a ten-point lead on the Bulldogs, highlighted by a three-pointer from Blackmon, who scored 13 of his 16 points in the second half to put the Bears up 58-48. But despite Brown’s best efforts, Yale clawed itself back into the game.</p>
<p class="p4">“We played well. We just missed some shots that we usually will make,” Fuller said. “We keep having little spurts of getting cold and letting teams go on runs. If we get rid of those, we will be fine.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bulldogs made a critical adjustment — switching to a 1-3-1 zone —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and scored 13 unanswered points over the next four minutes to take a 64-60 lead. Dallier led both teams with 30 points, ten coming in the final five minutes, sealing the Bulldogs’ 85-75 victory.</p>
<p class="p4">Spieth posted a double-double with 22 points and 10 rebounds, passing Mike Waitkus ’86 for 17th on Brown’s all-time scoring list. Okolie added a season-high 18 points.</p>
<p class="p4">But as for team statistics, Yale outscored Brown 30-7 in free throws and shot 55 percent from the field to 42.</p>
<p class="p4">“To be honest, after watching the film yesterday as a team, we just missed shots,” Blackmon said. “A lot of shots that we normally make were just coming out, and the momentum shifted drastically.”</p>
<p class="p4">Brown will continue its season on the road this weekend with a conference double-header, visiting Cornell Friday and Columbia Saturday. The games will be pivotal for the team in order to stay in the running for a place in the inaugural four-team Ivy League Tournament.</p>
<p class="p4">“Both are really good teams,” Fuller said. “Cornell beat Columbia at Columbia, and Columbia beat Cornell at Cornell. But I think we’re just as good.”</p>
<p class="p4">Brown currently sits sixth in the league with 10 games left in the season, ample time to regain its footing in the conference standings.</p>
<p class="p4">“As long as we keep working hard and playing hard — everyone just staying in the gym and putting in some work on their individual games — everything will fall into place,” Blackmon said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s hockey team fell to Yale Friday and Saturday in a home-and-home series by tallies of 4-3 and 4-1, respectively. Bruno entered the final periods of each matchup tied, but was unable to grasp the lead in either contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday night saw the Bears (4-16-1, 3-11-0 ECAC) slighted by the Bulldogs (10-7-4, 6-5-3) in a close matchup on home ice. After Brown took a two-goal lead in the second period, Yale responded with three consecutive goals — including two on the power play — to snatch the victory. Bruno recorded a total of 20 penalty minutes in the contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think special teams ended up being the turning point,” said Sam Lafferty ’18, who picked up three points in the matchup, posting two goals and an assist.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have to find a way to kill, and our penalty kill struggles,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “Every time we’ve been in games where we’re short for basically a full period of hockey … we’re not going to have success.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Max Willman ’18<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>opened scoringwith a power-play goal at 11:38 of the first frame to give the Bears an early lead. Lafferty sent two goals past Yale goaltender Patrick Spano in the second stanza, one of which was shorthanded. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a hard fought game and I think it could’ve gone either way,” Lafferty said. “If we can just stay out of the box and be a little more disciplined, then … we’ll be good.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re right there, but the objective is to win,” Whittet said. “We have to find a way to win hockey games, and the only way we’re going to do that is by being consistent, by winning battles consistently, by winning shifts consistently and by winning periods.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, the Bears were unable to snap a 1-1 tie in a scoreless second period and conceded three unanswered goals in the final stanza, including one on an empty net.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Charlie Corcoran ’18 posted a shorthanded goal late in the first frame to give Bruno an early advantage, but this was quickly matched by the Bulldogs’ Ted Hart, who scored on the power play less than one minute later to even the count.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gavin Nieto ’20 started in net for Brown in both contests, making 28 saves on home ice Friday and 22 Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will continue conference play next weekend with a pair of contests against No.17 Quinnipiac University and Princeton at Meehan Auditorium. Looking forward, Whittet emphasized the importance of both avoiding penalties and cleaning up the power play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our specialty teams entail our power play too,” he said. “The guys try to be perfect; they all want to get to their spots, when in actuality they should simplify things.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When we play hard, 5-on-5, we’re a tough team to play against,” Lafferty said. “We just need to keep working on our special teams and keep getting better,” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will host Quinnipiac Friday at 7 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just one week after besting Yale in a hotly contested 76-73 victory, the women’s basketball team traveled to New Haven for a rematch against the Bulldogs (10-7, 1-3 Ivy).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yale tallied the same amount of points as they did a week earlier at the Pizzitola Center. But Bruno (11-6, 2-2) did not, as it fell 73-51. Brown never led in the matchup.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After falling behind 21-8 in the first stanza, the team never found its rhythm. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We never really got in a groove,” said captain Megan Reilly ’18. “They played in a zone, which we haven’t seen much this season, so we had more turnovers than usual.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We didn’t play our game. We didn’t look like Brown out there,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Erika Steeves ’19 was once again solid in the loss. She notched 15 points and nine rebounds ­— just one rebound short of her sixth double-double of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno shot an inefficient 25.4 percent (18-71) from the field, and the usual performers did not produce as they previously have in the regular season. Justine Gaziano ’20 scored 11 points and dished out four assists; Taylor Will ’19 added nine points, four assists and seven rebounds; Shayna Mehta ’19 dropped seven points and grabbed six rebounds and Reilly scored six points on two three-pointers and came down with seven rebounds.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Reilly, after the defeat Head Coach Sarah Behn told the team “it’s time to dig in and work twice as hard this week in practice.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reilly added that this is just a bump in the road for the team. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s definitely something we can get out of,” she said. “It’s not like we’re in a rut or anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reilly said that the team needs to focus on limiting turnovers and maintaining their composure on offense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With six of their next eight games at home, the Bears hope to bounce back next weekend when they host Cornell and Columbia.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bryant hires James Perry ’00 as new head football coach</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The football team’s season opener against Bryant University on Sept. 16 will be equal parts antagonism and amity for both teams. The perennial clash of the in-state foes is one marked by familiarity and desire to stake the claim of football supremacy in the country’s smallest state. But the game will feature a head coaching matchup between mentor and protege, in which mutual respect gives way to passionate determination to best an old friend.</p>
<p class="p2">Across the gridiron from Head Coach Phil Estes P’18 will stand Bryant University’s newly-appointed Head Coach James Perry ’00.</p>
<p class="p2">Perry’s contributions to Brown football are many. Throughout his career, he has collected an extensive list of accolades: 1999 Ivy League Player of the Year, 1999 All-New England, 1999 Rhode Island Athlete of the Year and First-Team All-Ivy from 1997 to 1999. He holds an Ivy League record for career passing yards, completions and touchdowns, as well as seven others. Perry led the Bears to an Ivy League Championship in 1999, and he was inducted into the Brown Athletics Hall of Fame in Fall 2016.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’m certainly going to try to borrow a lot of the techniques that (Estes) used to make (Brown) a perennial winner and bring that to Bryant,” Perry added.</p>
<p class="p2">He was a “tremendous competitor,” Estes said. “He was a winner, he knew the game inside and out. As a player, he just got to that point where he controlled everything around him. His presence in the huddle was something that commanded a lot of respect,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Perry had a busy career between his time as a student athlete and his Jan. 3 appointment as head coach of Bryant.</p>
<p class="p2">After brief stints as positions coach at the University of Delaware, Dartmouth, University of San Diego and Williams College, Perry went back to school. He received a master’s degree in education policy and leadership from the University of Maryland in 2006 while working as a graduate assistant for the football team. Perry then returned to Brown, where he served as the program’s recruiting coordinator and quarterbacks coach.</p>
<p class="p2">“Nobody on any level, in any part of the country does a better job than Phil Estes at running his program,” Perry said. “Everybody who plays for Phil knows how much he cares about them. The amount of energy, the amount of effort he puts into making them the best they can be is a very real thing to players who play for him, and I’m going to bring that same energy and attitude toward my players.”</p>
<p class="p2">His time coaching under Estes was a formative experience for him, he said. His career then took him to Princeton for seven years, where he helped the Tigers win the Ivy League title in 2013 and 2016 as offensive coordinator.</p>
<p class="p2">Bryant’s Athletic Director Bill Smith said that Perry’s constant success, both as a player and a coach, was the most appealing aspect about him.</p>
<p class="p2">“We liked Coach Perry’s background with Ivy League institutions and … it’s both about winning on the field and also winning in the classroom,” he added. “We’re strongly committed to both here at Bryant.”</p>
<p class="p2">Boasting a 4-2 conference record last year, Bryant football is poised for success. “I think the program’s in good shape,” Perry said. “We’re going to change the way that we play, especially in the way that we approach the game. From a tempo perspective, it’s going to be much faster.”</p>
<p class="p2">This should come as no surprise, as Perry’s Princeton offenses were prolific. In 2016, the Tigers scored an Ivy League best 34.6 points per game. Estes compared Perry’s offenses with the University of Oregon’s high-speed squads under Chip Kelly.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’re expecting success right away with Coach Perry, primarily because of the style of football that he plays,” Smith said.</p>
<p class="p2">Another member of the Estes coaching tree will be joining Perry on the Bryant sidelines, as Ed Morrissey will be the offensive line coach for the Bulldogs. Morrissey coached at Brown while Perry was a player and at Princeton while Perry was also a coach.</p>
<p class="p2">Perry will face off against his former coach for the first game of Brown’s season — with their football careers intimately linked, the contest will carry an extra significance for the two men.</p>
<p class="p2">“Once he got the job we started breaking down Bryant film and personnel,” Estes said. “It’s certainly going to make that first game next year a lot of fun.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Once the referee blows that whistle and the game starts, I have no love for James Perry,” Estes said. “But then, after the game, I love him again.”</p>
<p class="p2">“I root for Brown every time I’m not playing them,” Perry said, mirroring the sentiment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brown football to play at Fenway Park</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/03/brown-football-play-fenway-park/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As it has every year for the past decade, the football team will face off against Dartmouth for its penultimate game of the 2017 season. But this year, Bruno’s final home game is no ordinary matchup for the Bears. Instead of senior day at Brown Stadium, Bruno will play under the lights of Fenway Park, the iconic home of the Boston Red Sox.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The athletic department released the news to the Brown community Jan. 12 over social media.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Everyone was extremely excited about it,” said quarterback TJ Linta ’18. “The opportunity to play at such a historic place like that is crazy. I remember going to games at Fenway when I was a kid, but I never thought I’d actually play a game there, let alone football. It’s just a dream come true for a lot of guys.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Director of Athletics Jack Hayes, the opportunity arose through an alum connected with the Red Sox organization. Last September, Hayes and the alum met with front office personnel at Fenway, who were “fantastic to work with” and very interested in the prospect of hosting the Bears following the success of the Boston College versus Notre Dame matchup held there in 2015, Hayes said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re always trying to find ways to differentiate our program from others,” Hayes said. “You do that by winning, you do that by having the best coaches, you do that by having the best students and you do that by finding unique locations to play in.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Because the Red Sox would not host a baseball game that late into the calendar year, and the Big Green traditionally faces off with Brown in November, Dartmouth was a natural fit to be Brown’s opponent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But as Head Coach Phil Estes P’18 remarked, the unique history between the Bears and the Big Green also helped seal the deal: Brown played Dartmouth at Fenway in 1923. Dartmouth is also a local, New England team, and both programs have “a very good alumni base in Boston,” Estes said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Estes, the Ivy League is already excited about making the event one of its premiere televised games. “If it is on TV,” Estes said, “it will be an attraction to our alumni base around the country.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not only do numerous alums from both schools come from the Boston area, many current players on the teams are from the region.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“As a Red Sox fan growing up, to play at Fenway would be an honor,” said tight end Anton Casey ’19 “A lot of the guys on the football team are from the Northeast, so it’s really a once-in-a-lifetime deal.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the winter cold beckons and the long off-season takes its toll, Estes also hopes that the opportunity will provide extra motivation for the players.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’d watch our guys when we’d practice at MetLife (stadium),” Estes said, referring to the home of the New York Jets and Giants. “Being at a pro venue gets them excited. To be in a place like Fenway, their eyes are going to open up and it’s going to be a fun time.” Either way, Estes remarked that the game’s location “does give a little extra motivation for some of the guys to make sure they get on that bus.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For recruiting, as well as for cultivating Brown grads, the news has become a strongly promoted focal point for Estes and Hayes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s been great,” Estes said. “We were able to tweet that out to all our incoming recruits and our alumni base to say we’re going to play at this iconic venue. It’s very good for recruiting.” Brown just announced its recruiting class for the class of 2021 Wednesday, which features future players from 17 different states, including Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hayes emphasized the event as more than just a game, but as a “University event.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It is an opportunity for Brown to extend its reach to Boston,” Hayes said. “That will help us build a large crowd for the game, and it will be a good opportunity for alums to stay connected with Brown in a very unique way. I was at a Brown football event in New York City, and they were all talking about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Amid all of the excitement, Estes stressed that playing at Fenway Park will also present special challenges. “What we can’t do is let the team get too focused on the venue and not what they have to do,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Several “unique quirks” include both teams sharing the same sideline, which can make substitutions more difficult and could create unforeseen advantages and disadvantages for both teams, Estes said. The placement of the communications box and its sight line to the field has not yet been specified. Estes noted that the coaches will likely consult the Boston College staff — who have experience playing at Fenway before — to learn more of the stadium’s nuances.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Regarding the financial nature of the deal, Hayes said the team will incur certain special costs, such as team traveling expenses and shuttling students. Because of this, the University does not have to guarantee a certain number of people in attendance or tickets sold. Still, Hayes emphasized a push from Brown and Dartmouth to “get as many people there as possible” and “make it a great event.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moving forward, Hayes remained optimistic about the opportunity for Brown to continue its relationship with Fenway.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’d image they’d want to continue to do it. I know the Brown folks are excited, and hopefully it’s something we can look to continue if it’s successful.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The women’s track and field team competed at the John Thomas Terrier Invitational at Boston University Friday, continuing its strong start to the season. Natalie Schudrowitz ’18 posted a standout performance in the mile, finishing fourth out of 140 runners and setting a new personal record with a time of 4 minutes, 42.54 seconds. Schudrowitz also broke the school record for the event by three seconds, previously set in 1987 by Wendy Smith ’87.</p>
<p class="p2">Since arriving at Brown in 2014, Schudrowitz has had an illustrious cross country and track career. In 2015, she earned NCAA All-American, NCAA Northeast All-Region and Second Team All-Ivy honors for cross country, running 20 minutes,16.7 seconds in the six-kilometer course at the NCAA Championships, finishing 23rd. Schudrowitz will return to competition next weekend at the Boston University Valentine Invitational.</p>
<p class="p2">For breaking the school record and setting a new personal best, Schudrowitz has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Herald: What were your expectations going into the meet?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Schudrowitz: I had kind of a difficult cross country season in the fall, so my expectations going into the race were just to get back into the feeling of racing and get back to how I felt last year racing track. I didn’t expect to PR or anything, but I just wanted to feel good in the race and see where my fitness levels were at.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How did the race feel? Did you think that you had set a new PR when you finished?</b></p>
<p class="p2">It was definitely a fun race; it felt really good. It was definitely the best I’ve felt running a mile in a long time. The mile was my race in high school, but for the last two years in track I’ve done mostly three-kilometer courses and I did a five-kilometer course last year, so I was really happy with how this one went. I knew that we were on pace for a PR. From the start, I could latch on to the three people in front of me, so that was really exciting, and I knew that I felt good during the race and I just went with it and it turned out well.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How do you prepare yourself mentally for a race?</b></p>
<p class="p2">You have to really be in a confident place with your training and just know that the training is there beneath you and that you’re just ready to put it all out there on the track. You have to convince yourself that you’re in the best possible state that you can be in for that particular race, no matter what little mishaps happen on the way to get there.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>You’ve competed in cross country and other distance events. Do you have a favorite?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Yeah, my favorite event is probably the 3K, which I will be running next weekend in Boston again. It’s longer than the mile, a little less than double the distance and it’s just more time on the track, so there’s more time for interesting things to happen.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>When did you initially get into the sport?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I played soccer for 10 years, and then I switched to running my sophomore spring of high school. (I was) a little late in the game, but my sister had been a runner in college at a Division III school, and she loved it, so I just thought I should try it out and see how it went, and I’m really happy with that decision. I’m really grateful to be running in college and to have some success also in college. I just hope for the best moving forward.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What’s your go-to race day breakfast?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Definitely oatmeal. I love chocolate oatmeal­ —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it’s delicious­. And probably some peanut butter — we’re all obsessed with peanut butter! I like animal crackers before a race, that’s one of my favorites just to snack on so you’re not hungry during the race. They’re nice and dry, so it soaks up some water.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>The track and field teams have had a strong start to the season. Looking ahead, what are your aims for the upcoming meets?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I hope to run a competitive 3K time definitely. I might run the 5K at our conference meet, depending on race plans. I probably won’t run the mile again, but we have a really great team, really competitive — I wouldn’t be surprised if someone breaks the mile record again, if they run it. It’s just been really awesome seeing the team grow and advance from the cross country season, and I really hope it keeps going. We’ve got some momentum, so it’s exciting.</p>

		<title>Flax &#039;17: Mariano Rivera: the greatest baseball player of all time</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In all sports, debates about the greatest player of all time are common. In baseball, the most popular answer is New York Yankees legend Babe Ruth. But, in my mind, Ruth does not hold a candle to Mariano Rivera. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those who are unfamiliar, Rivera was the Yankees closer for 19 years, retiring in 2013. He has 652 career saves, an all-time high, and a sterling 2.21 earned run average. He was a 13-time All-Star and received votes for Most Valuable Player nine times, an incredibly rare feat for a relief pitcher. He also received votes for the Cy Young award six times and finished in top three four times. Though he never won any of these awards, his credentials on the whole are more than enough to cement him as the greatest reliever of all time. Other closers like Rollie Fingers and Dennis Eckersley may have won a Cy Young and even an MVP, but neither has the body of work to compare to Rivera’s, as illustrated by a stat called ERA+.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">ERA+ is a player’s ERA, adjusted for the parks in which he pitches and the ERAs of the rest of the pitchers in the league. It is measured as a percentage of the league average, so an ERA+ of 90 is 10 percent worse than average and 110 is 10 percent better than average. Fingers and Eckersley have career ERA+ marks of 120 and 116, respectively. Rivera has a career ERA+ of 205, far and away the best of all time, with a minimum 1,000 career innings pitched.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second-best ERA+ belongs to Pedro Martinez, at 154. Not only was Rivera 105 percent better than the average pitcher, he was 33 percent better than the next best. Ruth is comparable as a hitter, with an all-time best 206 career OPS+, which is on base percentage plus slugging and similarly adjusted. As a closer, Rivera falls short in measurements of cumulative value. His 56.6 career Wins Above Replacement, a stat designed to measure the number of wins a player contributes to his teams over a career, is dwarfed by Martinez’s 86.0 and Ruth’s staggering 163.1. But WAR discriminates against closers for one critical reason.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">WAR treats all of a player’s appearances as contributing equally to winning, ignoring in-game circumstances. Obviously, not all situations are equal. This situational blindness works well for starting pitchers, whose value should not depend on how their offenses fare. But closers like Rivera are deployed almost exclusively in save situations, where their team leads by three runs or fewer in the ninth inning. As their success or failure essentially determines whether the team wins or loses, they contribute much more to the number of games a team wins than WAR would indicate. For a better measure of a closer’s value, we can look at Win Probability Added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">WPA is a simple cumulative stat: it measures the change in a team’s probability of winning based on what a given player does. If each team’s odds of winning are 50 percent and one team hits a walk-off home run, the hitter is credited with 0.5 WPA and the pitcher with -0.5 WPA.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rivera’s career 56.65 WPA trails only that of Roger Clemens and Greg Maddux, two pitchers who threw 3633.0 and 3724.2 more career innings than Rivera did, respectively. For Rivera to finish third all-time in a cumulative stat when most of his competition has pitched roughly four times as many innings as he did is truly remarkable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These stats, for the most part, compare Rivera to starting pitchers. It is generally considered harder to be a starter than a reliever, as failed starters like Rivera can turn into excellent relievers. But what makes Rivera the greatest of all time is the fact that he was a better closer than anyone else was anything. And while Rivera had difficulty starting, no starter could have been as great as a reliever as Rivera was.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ordinarily, a discussion like this would be stuck as a hypothetical forever, but history lends us a telling case study. Debuting in 1988, Hall of Fame pitcher John Smoltz was an otherworldly starter at the outset of his career. He compiled a 121 ERA+ during the first 12 seasons of his career and won the 1996 NL Cy Young. But a serious elbow injury cost him his entire 2000 season, and he returned to baseball the following season as a closer. For the next four years, Smoltz pitched from the bullpen but could only compile a 162 ERA+, far short of Rivera’s career mark.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, Smoltz was coming off of an injury, and he was 37 by the end of the 2004 season. Surely he was not at the height of his powers, right?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Smoltz returned to the rotation better than ever in 2005, at the age of 38. He compiled a 134 ERA+ over the next three seasons, proving that he was still at his peak pitching ability. If a Hall of Fame starter in his prime could not perform nearly as well as Rivera in the closer’s role, few or perhaps no starters can.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, for those who believe most in a player’s heart and his grace under pressure, I submit to you Rivera’s playoff statistics. He truly seemed to shine when the lights were on, registering a dumbfounding 0.70 ERA in 141.0 playoff innings, or about two seasons’ worth. League-adjusted stats do not exist for the playoffs, given their small samples, but a 0.70 ERA in Yankee Stadium in 2000 (roughly the middle of his playoff career) would have been an ERA+ of 687. Rivera was fortunate to be on a number of very talented Yankees teams and won five championships in his career. He was named MVP of the 1999 World Series.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Overall, whether you believe Rivera is the greatest baseball player ever depends on how you define “best.” If you think relievers are simply starters who could not hack it, so be it. If value is your end-all, be-all, then Ruth is an excellent choice for the best player ever. But I keep coming back to the simple fact that Rivera is, by a colossal margin, the best pitcher ever on an inning-by-inning basis. Ruth may have been as good a hitter as Rivera was a pitcher, but he was merely shades better than his peers, while Rivera was in a league of his own. In the history of baseball, no player has done his job better and for a longer time than Mariano Rivera. And that’s what makes him the greatest of all time.</span></p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: College basketball needs Grayson Allen</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Duke’s Grayson Allen has dominated college basketball headlines all season long, tripping opponents, losing his captaincy and serving an “indefinite suspension” of one game. He has evoked much ire and opposition from the sports world. ESPN analyst Seth Greenberg recently said that Allen “can’t control his actions.” Broadcaster Rece Davis said the junior “acts like a petulant toddler.” The internet has been full of negative articles about the Blue Devil — a simple Google search yields results such as “Duke’s Grayson Allen Needs To Be Put In Check,” “Coach K Went Way Too Easy on Grayson Allen” and “Grayson Allen Is The Biggest Villain In College Sports.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There was much outcry after Allen quickly returned from a self-imposed, one-game indefinite suspension after his third tripping incident. Greenberg said Duke should suspend Allen for the rest of the season. Though Allen’s antics are ridiculous and infuriating, the sports world is lucky to have him. Like it or not, college basketball needs Grayson Allen.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After the NBA instituted the “one-and-done rule” in 2005, allowing players to go pro after one college season, much of the conversation surrounding college basketball has concerned the sport’s own issues. Basketball purists say play has suffered because of the one-and-done; the most talented players come and go too quickly, leaving in their footsteps disorganized and disunified teams with unfulfilled potential. Claims that college basketball is a worsening product rule the day. ESPN analyst and Duke alum Jay Bilas, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis have all made headlines in recent years for trashing the sport. Many buy into this belief; complaints about the game have led to the reduction of the shot clock from 35 seconds to 30 in the sport’s recent past. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The negative stigma has impacted viewership as well. A look at recent National Championship game ratings reveal largely lackluster numbers. The 2011 championship between UConn and Butler garnered a 11.7 rating, and the 2012 matchup of Kentucky and Kansas, two of college basketball’s most historic teams, did only slightly better with a 12.3 rating. Last year’s game, an all-time classic between North Carolina and Villanova, amassed a 10.6 rating. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is an outlier: The 2015 championship put up far more impressive numbers. The game between Duke and Wisconsin put up a 16.0 rating, and the semifinal between Kentucky and Wisconsin accumulated a 12.4 — better than several championships in recent years. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So what was so different about the 2015 season? One word is all that’s necessary: Kentucky. The Wildcats threatened to go undefeated and all the way to the championship before losing to the Badgers in the Final Four, finishing the season with a 38-1 record. The team was the story of the season in and out of college basketball, as they became a formidable villain, coupling tremendous on-court play with less than stellar sportsmanship. Coach John Calipari’s pompous post-game interviews, Willie Cauley-Stein’s refusal to shake hands with Wisconsin and Andrew Harrison’s coarse language with Frank Kaminsky all serve as prime examples of the team’s villainy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Villains are good for the game. They draw in viewers. Basketball purists love to talk about the glory days of the sport: UCLA’s dominance under John Wooden, the Big East in the 1980s and the famous 1992 Duke-Kentucky game. And the common theme between these golden eras? The villains — Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton, the goliaths of UCLA; Patrick Ewing and the dominant Georgetown Hoyas and of course, Duke’s own Christian Laettner. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ratings, once again, show how the public has flocked to watch the most hated players and teams. Four of the top 10 highest rated college basketball championship games since 1975 include the teams above. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Villains also drum up much needed enthusiasm into the dialogue about college basketball that too often borders on melancholy. Instead of becoming entirely bogged down with discussion of pace of play and lackluster offense (yes, both could use some fixing), villains give college basketball fans something to rally around and enjoy: rooting against them. This season has been marked not by the usual articles and analysis about how unskilled and weak college basketball has become but with impassioned debate and wonderment at Grayson Allen and his actions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The college basketball season is not perfectly structured. The postseason tournaments hold so much sway over the regular season that there does not often appear to be much at stake. But every Duke game is now a must-watch and it’s all because of Grayson Allen. Will he trip another player? Will he get into an argument with an opposing coach? Will he rampage into an opponent’s student section? With Allen, anything is on the table.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Instead of demanding that Allen serve a longer suspension, the college basketball world should embrace him as the perfect villain. He is arrogant, whiny and prone to temper tantrums on the sidelines — it’s almost as if the sports gods have sent him to fans as a gift. Allen will almost certainly enter the NBA draft at the end of the season, so fans should enjoy the rest of this ride as long as they can. Because as much as college basketball hates on Grayson Allen, it will miss him terribly once he is gone. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The women’s basketball team notched two conference wins Friday and Saturday against visiting Cornell and Columbia. Bruno (13-6, 4-2 Ivy) moved into a tie for second place in the Ivy League following the two victories.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears kicked off the weekend’s action with a 72-67 win against Cornell (12-7, 3-3).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno pushed the pace early, as is characteristic of Coach Sarah Behn’s style of play, but fast-breaks did not immediately come to fruition. While Cornell’s threes were falling, Bruno’s possessions often resulted in turnovers. The Big Red had an early 11-0 run, stretching their lead to 25-13 with 7:40 to play in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Brown countered, launching a 22-9 run behind Justine Gaziano ’20, who had<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>11 second quarter points. The Bears shot 6-8 from three in the second stanza to make it a one-point game at the half.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears were “penetrating but then kicking it out and making an extra pass,” said Behn. “That was great basketball.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The third quarter saw the lead change hands between the two opponents but a 10-point surge from Taylor Will ’19 gave the Bears the 58-52 lead at the end of the frame.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The final stanza was a close affair. Cornell continued to threaten Brown and brought the game within two points several times. Despite the pressure, Brown held on for the 72-67 win.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gaziano had 27 points in the win and was 5-5 from three. She is second in the Ivy League in points per game, averaging 18.2 per contest. The significance of Gaziano’s play as a freshman is not lost on her coach. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“She’s a really special player,” Behn said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Will had 14 points in the win. She was the only other Bear in double figures.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Saturday’s game against Columbia (12-7, 2-4) followed a similar trajectory as the matchup with Cornell.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears once again started out sluggish and the Lions lead 19-11 after the first quarter. But Shayna Mehta ’19 took over in the second. Mehta ran the offense with precision, pushing the tempo, finding slashing teammates and draining from three. She scored 14 of Brown’s 30 first half points but Bruno trailed 36-30 at half.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mehta said that the team knows they have the ability to mount a comeback. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have great offensive threats,” she said. “We can never feel down because we know we can score.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Having trailed the entire game, the third quarter was Brown’s time to take the lead.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mehta drove to the low post, jump stopped, looked over her shoulder and hit a cutting Erika Steeves ’19 with a bounce pass through a tight window. Steeves laid it in with ease to knot the game at 38 a piece with just under six minutes to play in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was a physical affair, but Brown stayed tough and fought to a 69-60 win, notching their second victory of the weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mehta said that the team loves playing in fast and physical games. She ended the game with 18 points and six steals and Will added 18 points of her own. With Gaziano, Mehta and Will, Brown boasts three of the top five scorers in the Ivy League.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno has won six of its last eight and is peaking at the right time as Ivy League play continues.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We haven’t had a real sweep in the middle of the season in about two years,” said Mehta. “It’s a big step ahead for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Next weekend, the Bears go on the road to take on Harvard (16-3, 4-2) and Dartmouth (6-13, 1-5).</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After a week’s worth of preparation following a tough defeat at Yale, the men’s basketball team looked to bounce back in pivotal conference matchups at Cornell Friday and Columbia Saturday. Against the Big Red (6-15, 2-4 Ivy), the Bears (11-11, 2-4) gained the early lead and never looked back, taking home a crucial 81-70 win. But Brown had a hard time rallying for their second matchup of the weekend, playing catch-up after falling behind 47-28 at the half against Columbia (10-9, 4-2). The game ended in a 83-78 loss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Heading into the weekend, the Bears understood the importance of building momentum as increasingly demanding conference games stand between Brown and the inaugural four-team Ivy League Tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Energy going into Cornell was very high,” said starting forward Travis Fuller ’19. “We knew going in that these games were going to be a battle.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown started strong from the tip-off, quickly asserting its offense during the first half. Bruno took a 19-16 lead with 7:44 remaining and only built on this margin as the half progressed. When the buzzer sounded for halftime, the Bears were on top 35-26. Starting guard and co-captain Tavon Blackmon ’17 contributed eight points — with back-to-back threes at 5:51 and 5:09. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I was just being aggressive, picking my spots and just making shots,” Blackmon said. “The guys found me early and got my confidence going, and I just kept shooting.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Cornell would not lay down without a fight. The Big Red rallied hard to start the second half, scoring eight points in the first 1:15 to cut Brown’s lead to four. But a three-pointer from co-captain Steven Spieth ’17 and a pair of free throws from first-year Brandon Anderson ’20 put the Bears back on track.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno built a comfortable eight-point lead with 14:57 remaining after a layup by Blackmon that put the Bears up 45-37. Brown held the lead for the remainder of the game, riding a constant stream of buckets from Blackmon, who finished with 17 points, his highest output in league play this season. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our team played with great energy throughout the game,” Fuller said. “We played really unselfish basketball, which led to open looks for our guys.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the job was not over for Bruno. That night, the Bears made a four-hour trip to New York to face Columbia the next day. Against the Lions, the script flipped. Just over five minutes in, the Bears found themselves down 14-8, and trailed 47-28 by the end of the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I don’t think the travel affected us,” Fuller said. “We had a good day of prep and had a solid warm-up. We just had a tough first half.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Much of this difficulty lay in defending Columbia’s surging, hyper-productive offense. The Lions shot 63 percent on three-pointers, compared to just 21 percent from Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We just weren’t playing good offense against their zone,” Blackmon said. “It was the first time we had faced a zone in a long time this season, so I think that was an adjustment. Coach just told us to stick to the script, run our offense and defend, and we would get back in the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno did just that, clawing their way back to cut Columbia’s 21-point lead down to nine after a three by Corey Daugherty ’19 brought the score to 53-62 with 11:39 remaining. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears’ comeback continued down the stretch. After Spieth sunk a pair of free throws with two minutes remaining, Columbia only held a four-point margin with a 77-73 lead. With Brown down five, Spieth missed a last-chance three with eight seconds remaining, ending Bruno’s comeback bid.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the tough loss, Fuller remained positive. “The way we responded really showed a lot about our team,” he said. “We all are so competitive and want to win so badly that we weren’t just going to roll over. We fought back until the very end.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Coming away with a weekend split, Bruno maintains its fifth place position in the Ivy League standings ahead of Dartmouth and Penn and tied with Cornell. But Brown still has eight games remaining in the regular season, with six of them coming at home. Capitalizing on this home court advantage will be pivotal if the Bears want to claim a spot in the post-season in pursuit of the team’s first conference crown since the 1985-86 season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We really have to buckle down on defense and have a good week of practice,” Blackmon said. “There (were) still a lot of things that we could have cleaned up, and that we will improve upon the next time we play.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will host Harvard Friday at 7 p.m. and Dartmouth Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Harvard has a good team, but we’ll be ready,” Fuller said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s hockey team had mixed results this weekend, falling to No. 19 Quinnipiac Friday and drawing with Princeton Saturday by tallies of 1-0 and 3-3, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday saw the Bears (4-17-2, 3-12-1 ECAC) slighted by Quinnipiac (16-11-12, 10-6-1) on home ice. Bo Pieper grabbed an early lead for the Bobcats seven minutes into the opening frame, putting a shot past Brown netminder Gavin Nieto ’20 stick side for the only goal of the evening.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After being outshot 23-6 in the first two stanzas, the Bears generated more offensive pressure in the third, taking 15 shots compared to the Bobcats’ nine. Bruno pulled Nieto for the extra skater with 1:47 remaining, but was denied by Bobcats goaltender Andrew Shortridge, who made 21 saves in total for the shutout.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We got off to a slow start, but we picked it up as the game went on,” said Nieto, who made 31 saves in the loss. “We have to come out ready to go.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s a little bit of urgency that we need to play with from the drop of the puck,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “You have to be ready to go for the full 60 minutes.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, the Bears were unable to maintain an early lead against Princeton (9-11-3, 4-9-3) in a close matchup at Meehan Auditorium. Bruno scored three times in the first period, but the Tigers responded with three unanswered goals to even up the tally by the end of the second. A scoreless third frame sent the teams into a five-minute overtime, which concluded in a 3-3 draw.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tyler Bird ’18 posted a shorthanded goal four minutes into the first period, slotting the puck past Tigers netminder Colton Phinney for the first score of the evening. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Three minutes later, Charlie Corcoran ’18 netted a backhand shot — his team-high 14th goal of the season — off a pass from Brent Beaudoin ’20. Max Willman ’18 then notched a goal in front 10:37 into the stanza, giving the Bears a 3-0 advantage. Sam Lafferty ’18 and Nolan Aibel ’20 recorded assists on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We got out to a pretty strong start,” Bird said. “The key tonight was to just keep playing the way we were to get us those three goals.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We played a great first,” Whittet said. “It’s a 60 minute game — you’ve just got to find a way to sustain that process from shift-to-shift and period-to-period.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whittet cited injuries as a challenge for the team. “We’ve got a lot of injuries up front, so guys were stepping into roles that they haven’t been in,” he said. “It just shuffles things around.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears are in the final stretch of their season, with six games remaining before the ECAC playoffs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have to learn from what we did well,” Nieto said. “If we can just take the positives … and put them towards the rest of the conference play heading into playoffs, I think we’ll start to win some games and surprise some teams.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Going into the fourth meet of the season, the gymnastics team looked to grab its first win against Yale at the Pizzitola Center Saturday. Despite the fact they posted their second highest point total of the season, the Bears fell to the Bulldogs 192.225 to 193.500. Anya Olson ’18 won the all-around with a score of 38.550, surpassing her previous all-around career best of 37.650. She scored 9.475 on vault, 9.700 on bars, 9.600 on beam and 9.775 on floor. For her efforts and success in the meet, Olson has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The Herald: Why did you choose to come to Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Olson: A mixture of things — I had an old teammate from my gym at home (in Michigan) who came here first, and she was a junior when I came in as a freshman. She told me how everything was at Brown — how the coaching was. She just loved everything about the school, so that got me inspired.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What’s the most difficult part of being a student-athlete?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I never have enough time to do anything. It’s just a lot of hard work, but it’s worth it. Preseason … we have early morning lift three times a week. So we wake up at probably 6:30 or 6:40 a.m.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>How did you get into gymnastics?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I had a lot of energy when I was younger, and I would do cartwheels, headstands and stuff when I was really young. So my mom just put me in a mom-taught class — how most of us start — at 3 or 4 years old. I just went up the levels from there.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What was it like to sit out all of last year with a dislocated ankle?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was really hard because I had gotten through basically all of preseason, and then I got hurt right before Christmas break. We start our season in January, so I went home for six weeks, and then when I came back I was not really able to do much. There was another freshman who was hurt with me. We didn’t get to travel to any of the flying meets like California or Nashville, so we missed out on really huge things.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>How did you stay positive?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was focusing on this year; that really helped me. I was more focused on rehabbing, and then when I started to do some skills it got better because when we stayed home we would just go into the gym and practice. Being there to cheer on everybody and support the team in any other way that we could helps a lot too.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b> Do you have any pre-meet rituals?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We all like to do our hair and makeup together — there’s one girl who’s injured who does everybody’s hair — so that’s always kind of fun. We play really loud music in the locker room, so that usually gets us in the zone.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What was it like to win the all-around? Were you in the zone?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was trying not to focus on doing it because when I tend to focus on all four events, … thinking about that is a lot. I try to focus on one event at a time. I wasn’t expecting to do the all-around that meet, I was only going to do three events but then (Claire Ryan ’18) got hurt, so I had to stand in for the last event, so I was really surprised. I was supposed to be exhibition, so my score would not count (for beam), but I was going to compete anyway. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><i>This interview has been edited for clarity and length.</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s basketball team will host an LGBTQ Pride Night in partnership with the Brown LGBTQ Center this weekend, the first event of its kind at the University.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Saturday evening, Bruno will host Dartmouth in an Ivy League matchup, during which players will wear special multicolored warm-up jerseys in support of the LGBTQ students on campus. The Providence Gay Men’s Chorus will also perform the national anthem before the game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first 200 students to arrive at the game will receive free pride T-shirts, said Kelly Garrett, program director of the LGBTQ Center. The LGBTQ Center will also have a table set up in the Pizzitola Center where spectators can write notes of support to LGBTQ students that will be linked together as a symbol of allyship, Garrett said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We want people to know that we’re here, and we’re supportive of everyone on our campus,” said Head Coach Mike Martin ’04.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The event was created by the Brown Athletics department to show its strong support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer students on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I was really excited because the athletics department approached us,” Garrett said. “It’s a huge statement from the athletics department in terms of their support for LGBTQ students and their LGBTQ athletes.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This is the most visible event that’s ever happened,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We want to include everyone,” said co-captain Tavon Blackmon ’17. “It’s a night to support diversity and inclusion and let everyone know in the Brown community that they’re welcome to come to athletic events.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Martin emphasized the importance of using athletics as a means to engage with the wider community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We realize we play a game,” Martin said. “There are much bigger things going on in the world at any time — we can use our sport as a vehicle to show that support.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s a big step forward,” Blackmon said. “It will just bring unity on campus and bring a lot of people together.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The game will start at 6 p.m. Saturday at the Pizzitola Center. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro ’19: It’s official — MLB has lost its mind</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Way back in September, I <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/16/schapiro-18-dear-rob-manfred-dont-ruin-baseball/">addressed</a> MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred’s multiple proposals to cut down on game length, many of which I found either harmful to player safety or the integrity of the game. “Baseball, the national pastime, has been around since 1845 and has always been plenty exciting,” I wrote. “In fact, even as Manfred has fretted about pace of play, baseball’s TV ratings have soared, teams have seen record revenues and fan attendance is close to the highest it has ever been. The game is just fine the way it is. Commissioner Manfred, don’t ruin it.”</p>
<p class="p2">All those facts remain true, and what’s more, we’re coming off a World Series that was an instant classic; the final game received more than 40 million viewers and was the <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/presspass/latestnews/2016/11/03/world-series-game-7-averages-over-40-million-viewers">single most-watched baseball game</a> in 25 years. Regardless, Manfred and his Secretary of Ridiculous Ideas Joe Torre have forged ahead in their quest to change baseball from the national pastime to the Jerry Springer show. True blue baseball fans? Who cares about them? Let’s make baseball fun again!</p>
<p class="p2">I’m reacting, in particular, to a report by Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports late Wednesday afternoon. “Major League Baseball plans on testing a rule change in the lowest levels of the minor leagues this season that automatically would place a runner on second base at the start of extra innings,” he reported.</p>
<p class="p2">So, why do this? Surely, there must be a legitimate explanation for putting a runner on base for no reason at all. Will it keep players safe? Is it essential for MLB to continue functioning? It must be something like this — after all, there’s no way Joe Torre and Major League Baseball would simply initiate such a change without an extremely compelling reason.</p>
<p class="p2">Well, nope. Passan quotes Torre explaining the policy. “It’s not fun to watch when you go through your whole pitching staff and wind up bringing a utility infielder in to pitch,” Torre said. “As much as it’s nice to talk about being at an 18-inning game, it takes time.”</p>
<p class="p2">It’s not fun. Well, Mr. Torre, that’s a shame. It’s also entirely false. Since I’ve followed the Mets, for example, they’ve played several games of 18 innings or more. Without doing any research at all, one was in 2010 against the Cardinals — the Mets won in the 20th after Albert Pujols doubled in the 19th but the Cardinals didn’t score. One was against the Braves: Shaun Marcum pitched eight scoreless innings, the only thing he ever did for the Mets. Another was against the Marlins: I had a little league game, and when it ended two and a half hours later, the Mets were still playing.</p>
<p class="p2">And then there’s one of the most exciting games in baseball history: the Rick Camp game. Google it — I don’t have space to tell the story here. That game went 19 innings, and that was baseball at its absolute finest.</p>
<p class="p2">But, sure, it’s not fun. I just remember all these games for no reason. Certainly didn’t have fun experiencing any of those games, no sir.</p>
<p class="p2">And utility infielders pitching — has Joe Torre really lost it to the point where he no longer believes that’s fun? Just Google “position player pitching” and watch any of the extensive highlight videos, or read one of the articles with titles like “10 Most Memorable Position-Player Pitching Performances of All Time” or “The 5 Best Position Players to Ever Pitch in a Game.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then tell me again that it’s not fun to watch position players pitch — and tell me, moreover, that baseball fans don’t think it’s fun either.</p>
<p class="p2">You can’t. It’s simply not true.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s baseball,” Torre went on to say. “I’m just trying to get back to that, where this is the game that people come to watch. It doesn’t mean you’re going to score. You’re just trying to play baseball.”</p>
<p class="p2">Wait — what? If the report hadn’t lost me by the end of the first sentence, it would have, again, at this point. Joe Torre wants to “get back to that” by making a change that has never even entered mainstream American baseball thought? “You’re just trying to play baseball”? That’s nice, but baseball, sir, includes extra innings, which should never start with a runner on second base.</p>
<p class="p2">Back in September, I gave commissioner Manfred the benefit of the doubt. “Manfred, in summation, has taken improving the pace of play — a well-meaning objective — too far,” I wrote. Well, Manfred, Torre and the rest of MLB get no such benefit now.</p>
<p class="p2">This proposal isn’t well-meaning, misunderstood or complicated. It isn’t addressing a legitimate problem, and even if it was, it isn’t a legitimate solution. It’s an asinine PR move, a desperate attempt to attract people who aren’t baseball fans at the expense of those who are. It’s not worth being considered at a tee-ball level; to see it being tested in the minor leagues, for possible eventual implementation in the majors, is simply outrageous.</p>
<p class="p2">No more benefit of the doubt, no more chances for redemption, no more let’s wait and see. This is a stupid proposal, implemented by stupid people, for stupid reasons. None of this belongs anywhere near the national treasure that is Major League Baseball.</p>

		<title>Blasberg &#039;18: Bostonians, don’t forget about 2004</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The day after the Patriots’ miraculous Super Bowl LI win, Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy posed the question of whether this Super Bowl victory was Boston’s greatest sports story. He, like many, narrowed down the contest for this prize to the 2016 Patriots Super Bowl comeback and the 2004 Red Sox postseason, which included coming back from down three games to none against the Yankees in the American League Championship Series and ending an 86-year title drought. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Red Sox’s World Series win was unequivocally the greatest story in Boston sports history. The context in which the events transpired, the drama surrounding the Red Sox’s comeback against the Yankees and the way the city of Boston responded all make the Red Sox’s run a more compelling story than the Super Bowl comeback.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is important to differentiate between the greatest story and great sporting events. I am not asking for the greatest moment, the greatest game (which could very well be Super Bowl LI) or the greatest season in Boston sports history. The greatest sports story connects unbelievable events with a history that heightens the drama. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first criteria that makes the Red Sox’s run greater than the Patriots’ victory is the context in which they were playing for the World Series. As if having an 86-year title drought was not enough, those 86 years were made especially torturous by the amount of times the Red Sox got so close to snapping it, only to be disappointed. They appeared in three World Series in which they lost in Game 7 (1946, 1967 and 1975) and countless other seasons they were felled prior to the Fall Classic, seemingly always by the same foe: the New York Yankees. The Red Sox<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>facing the Yankees in the 2004 ALCS seemed poetic. It served as a chance for the Red Sox to redeem themselves after a heartbreaking loss to the Yankees in the ALCS the year before, as well as an opportunity to finally defeat the Yankees, who had bullied the Sox ever since they traded Babe Ruth in 1919.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Patriots’ meager history pales in comparison to that of the Red Sox. Though they lost two Super Bowls before winning their first, their initial absence of titles resembles the Chicago Cubs’ curse more than the Curse of the Bambino. For the vast majority of seasons before 2000, the Patriots were, quite frankly, not a good football team. They didn’t tease New England, they just embarrassed their fans. The Patriots also, for all intents and purposes, have no rival. For a while, the rival was whichever team Peyton Manning played for. Some could argue that a rivalry has brewed between the Patriots and New York Jets, but that has always been lopsided. No matchup for the Patriots contains the same mutual animosity that the Red Sox and Yankees had in the early- and mid-2000s. In the postseason this year, the Patriots played three teams that do not have a history of giving them trouble. Though the Steelers at first glance seem like good fodder for rivalry, their record against the Brady-era Patriots is 3-7 and 1-4 in Foxborough. Simply, the contextual drama that Brady’s suspension by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell added to the Super Bowl does not match the drama that the tantalizing 86-year curse cast on the Red Sox’s 2004 run.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second criteria that makes 2004 a better story than Super Bowl LI is that the Red Sox comeback was more impressive. In games one through three of the ALCS, the Yankees took the Red Sox’s strongest weapon in each game and neutralized it. In games one<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and two, they tore apart Curt Schilling then tagged Pedro Martinez for four runs, and in Game three, the Red Sox, who had been a terrific home team all year, were thrashed 19-8 at Fenway. Games four and five were so impressive because they saw the Red Sox trailing going into the eighth inning of both games. In game four, Mariano Rivera, the undisputed greatest closer in the history of baseball, took the mound to face Kevin Millar, who was not having a good series. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The game should have been over. For essentially his whole career, if Rivera took a lead into the ninth, it was game over. Somehow, though, a walk, a stolen base and a groundball up the middle tied the game, but many forget that game was not over. The Yankees had the bases loaded in the bottom of the 11th inning against Curtis Leskanic, who was a mediocre pitcher at best. As we all know, the Red Sox held on to win on a David Ortiz walk-off home run. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next night was a similar story. The Red Sox trailed when Rivera entered the game in the eighth inning, which is usually a death sentence. But with a sacrifice fly, they drove in a run and proceeded to win in the 14th inning on yet another walk-off by David Ortiz. Coming back against Rivera two nights in a row is unheard of, and, by the numbers, should never have happened. In game six, Curt Schilling took the field with a torn ligament in his foot and blood leaking through his sock and into his shoe. Nationally, that game is simply referred to as the “bloody sock game.” Such a visible sign of guts and grit was simply not matched in the Super Bowl. Sure, the Patriots were down against the Falcons, but they were down against a defense that had accomplished nothing of note all season. They did not have the greatest closer in the history of the game staring them down facing elimination. On top of that, when the Patriots started coming back, Tom Brady had an easy time picking apart the Falcons’ zone defense, whereas the Red Sox came back to win game four but were behind the next night in game five and struggled to escape Game six with a win. The Red Sox were in a more dire situation than the Patriots in the ninth inning of Game four and mounted a more impressive comeback. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The final criteria that makes the 2004 Red Sox story the greatest Boston sports story is something out of the Patriots’ control. Baseball’s postseason happens very sluggishly, which often leads to boredom in lopsided games and series. But in the case of the 2004 ALCS and World Series, the long games and the time between each game served to draw more and more people to the extraordinary events that were unfolding. This story picked up momentum like no other story, sport or otherwise, in my lifetime in Boston. The whole city was in a two-week frenzy. Super Bowl LI happened too quickly to infect the whole region like the Red Sox did. People were shocked by the Patriots, but the shock and surprise lasted only for one night, whereas the days of emotional ups and downs and the dramatic events that led to the Red Sox’s World Series Championship in 2004 lasted for weeks and drew people closer to the events.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Boston sports fans have been blessed to have witnessed some of the great stories in the world of sports, these two games are unmatched. While the Patriots’ Super Bowl LI championship loses out to the Red Sox’s 2004 World Series run — as most every story will — the city of Boston needs to take a step back and appreciate how rare it is to have so many great moments, stories and seasons transpire in one city.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After splitting its road double-header last weekend, the men’s basketball team hosted Harvard Friday and Dartmouth Saturday, hoping to creep up the Ivy League standings with a few weeks before the conference’s inaugural postseason tournament. But despite leading in both games at the half, the Bears (11-13, 2-6 Ivy) struggled to finish off the Crimson (14-7, 6-2) and the Big Green (5-16, 2-6), falling 87-74 and 77-74 respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Heading into its first matchup of the weekend against Harvard, the Bears were well aware of the magnitude of the game, which marked the halfway point in conference play. Sitting at sixth in the Ivy League standings, the Bears needed a few wins to keep pace with the top of the conference.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Overall, the energy was extremely high,” said co-Captain and starting guard Tavon Blackmon ’17. “The guys came in ready to play, and for the most part we played well.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno started off strong. While the lead changed hands multiple times in the first half, four of the Bears’ starting five put points on the board, and Bruno led 35-32 after the first 20 minutes. Starting forwards Travis Fuller ’19 and co-Captain Steven Spieth ’17 each contributed eight points and a rebound. Guard Obi Okolie ’19 added nine points of his own, including an emphatic dunk as he was fouled just before the eight-minute timeout, which helped swing the momentum in favor of the Bears going into halftime.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The first half is an example of how we can always play,” Blackmon said, adding that the team “had some really good possessions during that stretch.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears maintained this energy as the second half began, building an 11-point lead over the Crimson by the 13:09 mark. But the Bears struggled to continue their high-energy offense throughout the half. The Crimson rallied on the back of a 23-point effort from freshman Bryce Aiken, who Bruno struggled to stop as the half wore on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By 9:05, Harvard had erased the deficit entirely, and with only 3:25 remaining, the Crimson built an 11-point lead of its own, from which the Bears could not recover. When the final buzzer sounded, Harvard had taken the game 87-74. The Bears struggled from the free throw line down the stretch, shooting only 62.1 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno had trouble finishing scoring chances in the second half, Blackmon said. “We just didn’t capitalize off of our opportunities,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown had only 24 hours to regroup and rebound before an evening game against Dartmouth Saturday. But from the gun, the Bears responded well. Like the previous day’s matchup, Brown enjoyed scoring from an array of players in the first half. Co-Captain JR Hobbie ’17 and guard Corey Daugherty ’19 both hit pivotal three-pointers off the bench, while all of Bruno’s starters contributed points. At the end of the first half, the Bears led 36-32.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But once again, finishing off the opponent proved difficult for Bruno. Dartmouth’s Evan Boudreaux scored 15 of his 21 points in the second half and added 13 rebounds to help the Big Green build a 74-69 lead with only 2:43 remaining. Bruno closed the lead with 1:18 to go, tying the game at 74. But after Dartmouth sunk a 3-point dagger with 55 seconds left, the Bears could not respond and fell 77-74.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“That was a tough loss,” Blackmon said. “Overall we played solid, but we just really have to close those games and find a way to get the win. We are a really good offensive team and have been playing solid on defense for the most part.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moving forward, Brown hosts Penn Friday and Princeton Saturday. Despite taking two losses to their conference record, the Bears are tied for fifth place and two games behind fourth-place Columbia in the Ivy League standings with six conference games remaining. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I just want us to continue to fighting and working hard as a whole,” Blackmon said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The women’s basketball team went on the road this weekend to take on Harvard and Dartmouth. Bruno (14-7, 4-4 Ivy) fell to Harvard (18-3, 6-2) in Cambridge 69-59 and bested Dartmouth (6-15, 1-7) in Hanover 65-62.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a snow storm shutting down much of the Northeast, the games were pushed back to Saturday and Sunday, rather than their initially scheduled Friday and Saturday times.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears were able to have an additional productive practice on Friday because of the delay, said Shayna Mehta ’19. “We just had another day to prepare and go over Harvard’s sets and players and personnel,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first game was one with serious implications in the fight for the Ivy League title, as Brown and Harvard entered the matchup locked in a three-way tie with Princeton for second place in the conference standings going into the contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The beginning of the game was competitive and the two teams were knotted at 16 after the first quarter. Bruno showed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>its ability to share the ball, as six Bears scored in the initial stanza.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Superior rebounding by the Crimson and a slow Brown offense hurt the Bears in the second quarter, and Harvard built a lead. But back-to-back threes from Janie White ’18 and Justine Gaziano ’20 cut the lead to 36-33 before the halftime break.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The third quarter saw Bruno take the lead, but Harvard responded with six unanswered points in the final 1:46 of the frame. Bruno entered the final ten minutes of play down 53-48.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown found late success in fouling Harvard’s Jeannie Boehm, a first-year forward who is shooting 19.2 percent from the line this year. “She’s a very good player inside, so whenever she got in we knew we had to just foul her,” Mehta said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The strategy worked to an extent, but the Bears shot poorly from the field all night and were unable to take advantage of Harvard’s missed free throws. Bruno’s offensive woes were especially apparent in the final frame — in which Brown posted only 11 points and shot 0-7 from three. Bruno shot 33.3 percent on the night and 16.7 percent from beyond the arc.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unable to overcome the deficit, the Bears lost 69-59, posting their second lowest point total of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We didn’t move the ball well enough, and we only had seven assists last night as a team,” captain Megan Reilly ’18 wrote in an email to The Herald. “In games when we’ve had 15 or more assists, we have gone 7-0. So we definitely get better looks on offense when we are sharing the ball, getting good looks and knocking down shots.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gaziano led all Bears with 16 points in the contest, Taylor Will ’19 added 13 points of her own and Mehta recorded a double-double with 12 points and ten rebounds.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Dartmouth was last place in the Ivy League standings coming into Sunday’s game, the stakes were just as high as the night before, Mehta said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dartmouth was sluggish come game time, and Brown sped out to a 17-8 lead after one quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the second quarter, the roles reversed, and the Big Green poured in 21 points while holding Brown to only 10. Dartmouth held a narrow 29-27 advantage at half in a low scoring contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown tallied 19 points in each of the final two quarters and held Dartmouth to 17 and 16 in the third and fourth, respectively, eventually edging out the hosts 65-62.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno shot better from the field than it did Saturday at 40.3 percent but continued to come up short from beyond the arc, connecting on only 17.6 percent of their attempts. Brown only served up five assists as a team in the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Erika Steeves ’19 scored 17 points and grabbed eight rebounds in the win. Gaziano and Mehta added 16 points each.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown now holds fourth place in the Ivy League — the final spot that would allow them entrance to the Ivy League Tournament at the end of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Next weekend, the team squares off at home against the top two teams in the league: Penn (14-6, 7-0) and Princeton (11-9, 5-2), respectively. Both the Quakers and the Tigers are on five game winning streaks.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s hockey team continued ECAC play with a pair of away contests this weekend, falling to Colgate University Saturday and No. 12 Cornell Sunday by tallies of 2-1 and 5-3, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears (4-19-2, 3-14-1 ECAC) were edged by Colgate (8-17-5, 6-10-2) in a close matchup in Hamilton. Sam Lafferty ’18 tied the score at one in the third, but Bruno was unable to grasp the win, conceding a goal in the final minute of play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a tight game all the way down to the stretch,” Lafferty said. “They got a lucky bounce toward the end.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After two scoreless periods, the Raiders’ Evan Peterson posted the first goal of the evening at 4:49 in the third stanza, snatching the lead. Less than a minute later, Lafferty evened the score with a one-timer in front of the net. Max Willman ’18 and Nolan Aibel ’20 each recorded assists on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears had a power play at 8:41 in the third period as the Raiders’ Ken Citron picked up a five-minute major and a game misconduct for boarding, but Bruno was unable to find the back of the net to take the lead.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s no secret that our power play has struggled,” Lafferty said. “We got some power plays late in the third period when it was a tied game and just weren’t able to capitalize on those.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno was denied victory late in the game by the Raiders’ Jacob Panetta, who slotted a goal past Gavin Nieto ’20 off a rebound with 46 seconds remaining in the final stanza. The Bears pulled Nieto for the extra skater with 34 seconds left, but Colgate netminder Colton Point deflected two shots to preserve the score. Nieto made 25 saves in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, the Bears were unable to maintain an early lead against No. 12 Cornell (16-6-3, 11-4-3) in Ithaca.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Andrew Doane ’17 opened scoring at 3:28 in the first period, sending a shot past Cornell goaltender Mitch Gillam off a rebound. Gillam initially saved a shot from Trey Dodd ’20, but Doane finished off the play, edging the puck in for his second season goal. Jack Gessert ’20 also posted an assist. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Big Red responded with four consecutive goals before Dodd tipped the puck into the net at 16:12 in the second period, decreasing the deficit. Joe Maguire ’20 and Josh McArdle ’18 each recorded assists on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lafferty posted an unassisted shorthanded goal — his tenth of the season — at 2:17 in the third period to tighten the score, but Cornell answered with another goal four minutes later to secure the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I wouldn’t say there’s a reason why we’re letting leads slip away,” Dodd said. “It’s just more (about) bearing down and building on a lead instead of being content with a one-goal lead.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The result obviously wasn’t there, but the effort was,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears are in the final stretch of their season with four games remaining before the ECAC playoffs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“On a given night, one piece of our team game might be going really well and another piece might not quite be there, so it’s just a matter of putting that together,” Lafferty said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were within one goal against a team that was number 12 in the country at the time,” Dodd said. “Moving forward, we’ve just got to keep doing what we were doing right and correct what we were doing wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno will host Dartmouth Friday and Harvard Saturday at Meehan Auditorium. Face-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. both nights.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mike Daly brings winning history to Brown lacrosse</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After building a Division III dynasty from the ground up, Head Coach Mike Daly faces a different sort of challenge — taking over a men’s lacrosse program coming off its best season in school history.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Daly was introduced as head lacrosse coach July 1, just weeks after Lars Tiffany ’90 announced he was leaving Brown to take the head coaching position at the University of Virginia. In many ways, 2016 was a banner year for Brown lacrosse as the team posted a school-record 16 wins, earning the Ivy League regular season title and winning two games in the NCAA tournament before falling to University of Maryland in the national semifinals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Along with Tiffany and the rest of his coaching staff, a decorated class of seniors departed from last year’s team. But if Daly’s past credentials — a 244-83 record and three Division III national titles over 18 years at Tufts University — are any indication, Brown lacrosse’s winning ways are not likely to fade away with the cast of last year’s squad.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown was not the first Division I program to reach out to the decorated coach. But in Daly’s eyes, Brown was the right choice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There were a couple of other opportunities, but this felt like the right fit from the beginning,” Daly said. There was a “real apparent commitment from (Director of Athletics) Jack Hayes and the University. The entire place has been wonderfully supportive. It’s a great fit for our family. It’s been everything we hoped for and more.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The search for a new head coach was a positive one,” Hayes wrote in an e-mail to The Herald. “Mike Daly was the ideal candidate because he had tremendous success at an excellent school. He developed a model program for success” at Tufts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Daly brings a few significant connections to the new position. Ryan Molloy, the older brother of Dylan Molloy ’17 — the defending Tewaaraton Award winner as college lacrosse’s top player and the anchor of Brown’s attack— was a captain on Daly’s 2011 team at Tufts and won a National Championship on the 2010 squad.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Daly will also take over a team that has been primed for his own distinct style of play — a frenzied, high-paced approach to the game that has proven wildly successful at both Tufts and Brown. Sean Kirwan worked as an assistant coach under Daly at Tufts before coming to Brown in 2014 as offensive coordinator under Tiffany, bringing Daly’s style with him.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 2016, with Kirwan pulling the strings, Brown had Division I’s most potent scoring offense at 16.32 goals per game. The Division III leader? Daly’s Tufts team, which scored 17.32 goals per game and won its seventh consecutive NESCAC title before falling in the national title game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We certainly didn’t invent any of this,” Daly said. “We won with it, so that’s why some of the attention came to it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Watching Syracuse and Virginia play a similar style in the ’90s was highly influential for Daly. “That game every year was 22-21 or 19-18, so it just was one of my earlier imprints of what the game should look like,” he said. “That’s really what we were emulating.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kirwan has since moved on to Virginia with Tiffany, but the similarities of Daly’s scheme have helped with the team’s adjustment to the new staff, said defenseman Alec Tulett ’17, one of three returning All-Americans from last year’s team.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Tulett also said the team is not content with the speed of last year’s team, a point which Daly reiterated himself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We want to play just as fast, if not faster,” Tulett said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The guys had a taste of playing that way and they did not want to go back to a regimented, slowed-down kind of style,” Daly said. “The guys have really just embraced it. It’s fun, and it’s definitely the way we think the game should be played.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite a different recruiting timeline between Division I and Division III, the academic prestige and location of Tufts seem to present a near-identical challenge for Daly at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our goal in the recruiting process is always to get the right guy, at the right place, for the right reasons — and they’re out there,” Daly said. “It’s about finding the right guys and the guys who embrace what we’re doing to work their tails off and improve.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All similarities aside, Daly has not hesitated to shake things up for his new team. For example, players are now required to keep their individual lockers neatly organized and in order, Tulett said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It used to be a mess,” he added. “It’s more of a metaphorical thing, but perfection starts at home.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There were some personality changes and some cultural changes,” Daly said. “The guys have been great. They’ve been unbelievably receptive — they just needed to adjust to (the new staff) and vice versa.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Daly was able to bring his assistant coaches from Tufts, but he worries little about managing a locker room full of players brought in by the previous staff. While such a dynamic might divide some teams, Bruno’s run to the final four has the team hungry for more, embracing Daly and his staff in the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Everybody around here had a great taste of success last year and they want more; they’ll do whatever it takes,” Daly said. “If that includes adjusting to a new coaching staff, they’re doing it. They’re doing everything we ask.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">With a brand new facility and strong upperclassmen leadership, the baseball team is entering its season in high spirits.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re very confident in what we can do,” said co-captain and starting pitcher Christian Taugner ’17. “Our optimism — freshmen through seniors — is going to drive us through the season and boost us forward.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears finished last season with a 15-24 overall record, placing seventh in the conference and last in the Red Rolfe Division with a 9-11 Ivy League record. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">From last year returns a key group of upperclassmen, including co-captains Taugner, outfielder Rob Henry ’17 and catcher Josh Huntley ’17, all of whom were regular starters in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team will also benefit from the addition of nine new first-years instead of the usual six per class. Having a roster with an equal balance of younger and more experienced players has been an advantage for the Bears in training. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Seeing the upperclassmen work together with the younger players has been a definite positive for us,” said Grant Achilles, who leads the Bears in his third year as head coach.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s our opportunity to help shed some wisdom to some of the younger guys,” Huntley said, who paced last year’s team with a .313 batting average. “We’ve put a big emphasis on being able to help the younger guys learn as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Offensively, the Bears have been working to improve last season’s .259 team batting average. At the plate, Bruno will miss some key 2016 graduates, including infielder Tim McKeithan ’16 and outfielder Jake Levine ’16. But some of the team’s younger members hope to fill in the blanks left by the six departing seniors. A large percentage of the team’s home runs with be departing with the seniors, as the class of 2016 accounted for half of the team’s 22 dingers. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve seen some of our younger guys and also players who may not have had as much exposure last year truly step into those roles and take them on well,” Achilles said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Following last year’s strain on a smaller pitching staff, the Bears will rely on a stronger, larger group of pitchers — including Taugner, Max Ritchie ’17, Reid Anderson ’18 and Dante Bosnic ’18 — to power through four-game weekends. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was tough in that last game because we didn’t have enough arms to throw,” Taugner said, who led the Bears in 2016 with a 2.79 earned run average after returning from elbow surgery in 2015. “This year, we have five or six more pitchers that will have an immediate impact, which will really help us out.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With the new season fast approaching, Achilles places particular emphasis on building up the team’s defensive strategy. He cited Brown’s new facility as a catalyst for improvement in this area.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We let a lot of the plays go that we should have made over the past several years,” Achilles said. “A key part for us, just in our quest to improve the team defense, is being able to actually get out there and do it more.” The new facility, he said, gives the team that opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown’s new turf baseball and softball complex, constructed in the second half of 2016, has afforded the team an ability to practice outside in colder temperatures than in years past. The facility has provided more opportunities for full-team practices and repetitions in the offseason.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s a great boost in our ability just to practice,” Taugner said. “There have been times where our first time outside isn’t until we travel for our first away game at the beginning of March.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s definitely going to pay off,” Henry said, who finished last season with a team-high 40 hits. “That’s been the main part of our training — just playing more baseball.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking forward, the Bears have their sights set on earning their first Ivy League title in ten years.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Winning the Ivy League championship — that’s our expectation,” Huntley said. “Anything short of that is settling and not fulfilling our expectations.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s just a matter of competing and staying present in the moment,” Henry said. “Our season goes by so fast — we have these expectations, we have these goals, and then we just lose sight of them once the season starts because we get so caught up in playing games and recovering.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will begin their season March 3 and March 12 with a pair of three-game road series at Nicholls State and Texas A&amp;M before playing their home opener on their new field against Holy Cross March 15. The game will mark the first time in Brown’s recent past that the team is able to play a game at home before the month of April. Bruno is slated to play a full month of non-conference games before kicking off Ivy League play at Cornell April 1. April will keep the team busy with 25 games scheduled, including 12 home contests, ten of which will be against conference competition.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re very confident going into the season,” Taugner said. “We’re going to prove some people wrong, and that’s what we’re going to take pride in.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">After a season of disappointment, the women’s lacrosse team is hopeful and eager for the 2017 season, which starts Saturday against Sacred Heart.</p>
<p class="p2">Having won only a single conference game in the 2016 season, Bruno finished the year tied for last in the Ivy League with a 6-9 overall record. The Bears are one of two Ivy League women’s lacrosse teams to have never won a conference championship.</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno lost six seniors from last year’s team, but in their place enters the class of 2020 — a nine-player group in which Head Coach Keely McDonald ’00 sees promise.</p>
<p class="p2">“They’re a very positive, hard-working crew that just adds to those elements of our culture,” McDonald said.</p>
<p class="p2">Co-captain Kerianne Hunt ’17 said the first-year class has already raised the competitive spirit of the team. They “just bring this … fresh, really dynamic, fiery spirit to our team,” Hunt said.</p>
<p class="p2">They are “so united in everything they do, they have the strongest, hardest work ethic and they are also so eager to learn from us,” she added. “It’s really encouraging to teach them and also to see how much they want to get better. … They have already made an incredible impact on the team.”</p>
<p class="p2">Beyond their attitude, the first-year class adds much-needed depth to the 30-player roster, McDonald said.</p>
<p class="p2">“We will definitely have some freshmen contributing on really every area of the game,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">The most notable loss is attacker Lauren Toy ’16, who led the Bears in goals and assists last year.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite Toy’s absence, Bruno is returning most of its offensive arsenal. Jillian Lee ’17, Rose Mangiarotti ’18, Zoe Verni ’19 and Hunt tallied 15, 13, nine and nine goals last season respectively.</p>
<p class="p2">The team will also bring back hybrid attacker and midfielder Hafsa Moinuddin ’19, who broke out as a rookie. She netted 12 goals and added eight assists in 12 games last season.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears have been working in order to better their fitness. While Ivy League regulations limit the number of offseason practices the team is able to have, it has been conditioning throughout the fall in preparation for spring, with a twist — all of the team’s conditioning is done with lacrosse stick in hand to benefit the team’s play without violating league policies, Hunt said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“We had two scrimmages this past Saturday at UConn, and our coach made the comment that we outlasted both of the two teams we played,” she added. “I think that’s just a result of our hard work.”</p>
<p class="p2">“To be a great Ivy League team, you have to put in work on your own,” McDonald said. “That really comes from the players owning the team,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">A poor 2016 campaign is reflected in Bruno’s external expectations. In a recent preseason media poll, Brown was predicted to finish the season last in the Ivy League.</p>
<p class="p2">As is often the case with a team slated to underperform and up against a difficult challenge, the Bears are setting their sights high but focusing on what they can control: themselves.</p>
<p class="p2">“Our top priority is to focus on us,” Hunt said. “In doing that, we are going to have a successful, winning season with the goal of getting to the Ivy Tournament and winning the Ivy League Championship.”</p>
<p class="p2">The team’s 2017 campaign begins at home, where they will take on Sacred Heart Saturday and the College of the Holy Cross Tuesday. The Bears will then fly to Orlando, Fla. to play Louisville.</p>
<p class="p2">For now, McDonald is eager to get started.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“We (have) got to play games,” McDonald said. “We really just need to go against another opponent. That’s the best way to learn and the best way to grow and identify strengths and weaknesses.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Last year, a single overtime goal stood between the men’s lacrosse team and a spot in the NCAA Championship game. Bruno advanced to the Final Four for just the second time in program history and notched a 16-win regular season in the process — another Brown record. A few days later, Dylan Molloy ’17 won the Tewaaraton Award, given annually to the most outstanding college lacrosse player in the nation. In more ways than one, 2016 was a historic year for Brown lacrosse.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This weekend, the Bears will begin their 2017 campaign against Quinnipiac University, and the team taking the field Sunday carries many similarities to last year’s team — including high expectations for the coming season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are looking to continue on the success we had last year,” said starting defenseman and co-captain Alec Tulett ’17. “We’re coming off two back-to-back Ivy League Championships. The bar is set very high, but we have a team mentality not to rest on our laurels.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno will return Molloy, as well as Tulett and long-stick midfielder Larken Kemp ’17, after they received All-American honors last season. Along with veteran midfielder Jimmy Coughlan ’17, the four will serve as team captains for this season. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Much of the focus, especially from opposing teams, will be on Molloy, who will be a mainstay in Bruno’s offense after his 62-goal, 54-assist season. His 6.44 points-per-game average was the highest in the nation last year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Dylan Molloy continues to be our hardest worker and toughest competitor,” new Head Coach Mike Daly wrote in an email to The Herald. “He sets the tone for our team at practice and in the weight room.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But other key pieces of the Bears’ lineup will be expected to contribute early on. Brown returns every starting member of last year’s three-man defensive front in Tulett, JJ Nysykalo ’18 and Alex Santangelo ’19. Kemp will also be a critical element of Bruno’s high-pace transition offense. He not only was ranked 12th nationally last year in turnovers caused, but also added 12 assists and netted six goals — including a particularly memorable goal in Brown’s matchup against Maryland in the semi-finals of the NCAA Tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The entire senior class has been amazing, stepping up in leadership positions and doing a great job managing all the transitions,” Daly wrote. “I feel very grateful and humbled by their effort to sustain the success of last year.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In many ways, the team has changed since its near-title run last spring. Bruno graduated a particularly strong core of team leaders in All-Americans Jack Kelly ’16 and Will Gural ’16, as well as All-American Honorable Mentions John Yozzo-Scaperrotta ’16, Kylor Bellistri ’16, Henry Blynn ’16 and Brendan Caputo ’16.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There are always losses to graduation and every team dynamic is different, regardless of who or how many guys graduate,” Daly wrote. “This year’s team has been an absolute joy to be around, coach, and it’s a privilege to do what I do.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Daly added that, despite the loss of its two-time captain Kelly ­— who now plays professionally for the Denver Outlaws ­— the goalie position had previously been the teams “most consistent phase.” All four goalies on the Brown roster — including first-year Phil Goss ’20 — are in “tight competition” for the starting spot come Sunday. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I have been most impressed with that position since day one, and it was certainly a strength of our team in our scrimmage,” Daly wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Tulett, other first-years have also been stepping up, especially to fill the void left on the offensive end. Tulett added that Luke McCaleb ’20 and Jack Kniffin ’20 “have been standouts on offense so far in the freshman class.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But possibly the most significant change for Bruno was the departure of head coach Lars Tiffany ’90, who left for the University of Virginia, which led to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the hiring of Daly from Tufts University — where he had led the Jumbos to three Division III national titles.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The team has been simply amazing with their preparation and their acceptance of a new staff,” Daly wrote. “They have taken everything we have thrown at them, and they respond with great work ethic and toughness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has been great to be here and Brown has been everything we hoped for and more.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strategically, the Bears will still employ the quick-fire offense that helped propel them to success last year. Bruno’s former offensive coordinator, Sean Kirwan — who spearheaded the philosophy behind last year’s attack — came from Tufts after working under Daly for multiple seasons.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But from a team culture standpoint, the fresh coaching staff has implemented a number of new approaches as well. “We’ve really focused on team culture and basic fundamentals a lot more than we did before,” Tulett said. He added that the team has been reading a book by John Wooden, the great UCLA basketball coach, and players have been “discussing what it means to be a great team, what it takes to be a great teammate.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It has really helped us focus on what we want to accomplish this year,” Tullet said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Last Sunday, despite the blizzard-like conditions, the Bears faced off in a scrimmage against the Boston Cannons, a professional Major League Lacrosse team. The matchup ended in a 9-9 tie, and Daly was impressed by the teams’ competitiveness, as well as its “great job on ground balls” and “toughness versus a very physical team.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was snowing a ton, and our team really adapted well to the conditions,” Tulett said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He added that Brown will benefit from its depth, “especially in terms of underclassmen and freshman coming in. We have a lot of talent down there, and a lot of players that will make a key impact this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the real first test for the Bears will be the team’s season opener this Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our team and I are focused on Quinnipiac right now,” Daly wrote. “They are well coached, have some very talented players all over the field, and they were an NCAA tournament team last year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We will need all phases to be at their best to win.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Softball aims to win first Ivy League title in 13 years</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Three years of improvement in the win-loss column has the softball team looking for a successful season under Head Coach Katie Flynn, who has seen the Bears improve from 4-34 in 2014, her second year as coach, to 18-23 last year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We are simply more talented than we have been in my tenure here,” Flynn said. “This team wants to compete and contend.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The team got off to a promising start last season, but that soon gave way as Ivy League play began. This year, Flynn hopes to be the “hot team” in the Ivy League.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The squad has seen the culture shift over the past few years, said catcher Julia Schoenewald ’17. Schoenewald, one of the team’s co-captains, added that she is “extremely proud of the senior class for instilling high expectations of hard work, dedication and unity.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Schoenewald said the team has “leaders at every level with many different styles.” She stressed the importance of individual relationships with her teammates “to push them to be their best and to set an example through work ethic and integrity on and off the field.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The work of the team’s captains has not gone unnoticed by younger members of the squad.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Each one of them brings a different leadership role to help our team,” said infielder Sarah Fringer ’20. “They are all great role models, and I definitely look up to them for how I would like to be, not only as a softball player, but also as a person in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The team is not immune to year-to-year attrition, losing some key players from the 2016 squad. This year, the Bears are without Janet Leung ’16, who played all 41 games last season and posted a .315 batting average, and outfielder Yeram Park ’18, who will miss the season while on a mission trip, Flynn said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Those were two big cogs in our offense, but we feel that we have the personnel to make up for it,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those losses will be mitigated with increased depth “on the mound and more competition at all positions,” Flynn said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The return of Meghan Wimmer ’19 from injury and the addition of Emily Waters ’20 give Bruno five pitching options, compared to just three last year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The team has added five freshmen to the roster, and despite the challenges that additions may pose to some teams’ chemistry, Fringer said it has not been an impediment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “From the moment we stepped on campus last semester, we felt like we had an immediate family through our teammates and coaches,” she said. “We are not only teammates on the field, but we are great friends off the field, and I know if I ever needed something I could turn to any one of these girls at any time.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Schoenewald added that the chemistry will only build as the team prepares for its first game of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet another key addition is the completion of the new baseball and softball facility this spring, which will feature a turf field, dugouts, improved batting cages and bullpens, new bleachers and new scoreboards, The Herald previously reported. Bruno’s pitchers will benefit from a newly-leveled bullpen, as the pitchers were previously required to warm-up uphill.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have an amazing facility to compete in and for our fans to enjoy,” Flynn said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will play a 47-game schedule this season, opening at the Madeira Beach Tournament in Florida Feb. 24. Bruno will break in its new turf field March 28 in a matchup against Quinnipiac University.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The gymnastics team captured its first win of the season Sunday, posting a season-high final team score of 192.650 during its annual Senior Day meet. Prior to the competition, five seniors, Tori Kinamon ’17, Jorden Mitchell ’17, Brooke Williams ’17, Caroline Morant ’17 and team manager Renee Edelman ’17 were recognized for their individual achievements and contributions to the program over the past four years. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears hosted the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and Southern Connecticut State University. Because the Bears were the home team, they competed in the Olympic order, starting on vault, before moving to bars, beam and the floor exercise. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno’s first rotation was highlighted by personal-bests from Anne Christman ’20 and Julia Green ’19, with scores of 9.600 and 9.675, respectively. Morant claimed the vault title with a 9.775. After the first event, the Bears led the competition with a team score of 47.925.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown got off to a shaky start on the bars, but Maggie McAvoy ’18 pulled the rotation back together with a clean routine and a stuck double layout dismount that earned her a season high 9.650 and second place in the event. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve been really focusing on details lately,” McAvoy said of the team’s recent training sessions. “I’ve been working on sticking for the last couple weeks. To nail the double layout so well made me so happy.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following McAvoy, Mitchell made her first appearance of the season on bars and kept the momentum swinging with a 9.600. Anya Olson ’18 nabbed the bars title with a stuck double tuck dismount and a personal best of 9.775. At the competition’s midpoint, the Bears kept a tight grip on first place with a 95.650.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the balance beam had been the source of struggles in past meets, the team was able to put up five solid routines Sunday. The pressure was on when, following a routine that had a few mistakes, Christman stepped up to salute the judges. Her teammates shouted “confidence, Annie!” and cheered her on as she mounted the apparatus. Christman recalled being “really nervous” because beam was “shaky” during practice, but she maintained her balance and got the team back on track. Regan Butchness ’18 stuck her dismount for a season high 9.775, earning her a third place finish. Morant and Mitchell raised their personal bests and secured the two top spots on beam with a 9.875 and a 9.850, respectively. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We started with a fall, but then every single person after kept improving,” Morant said. “Once we were done, we all kind of knew that was one of the best beam teams we’ve done this season.” The team’s score of 48.750 in the event was a season-high for the Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Going into the final rotation, the Bears led the field with a team score of 144.400. The team has been focusing on “presenting and drawing the crowd into our performances,” said Head Coach Sara Carver-Milne. Her team did just that, as Morgan Hagenbuch ’19 kicked off the floor exercise with a career high 9.675. Christman claimed third place on the event with a personal best 9.725. Olson followed with a solid 9.700, and Morant closed the show with a season-high 9.875 to take first place. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno ended the meet with a 192.650, almost two points ahead of second-place Southern Connecticut, and Morant outscored fellow competitors by nearly three points to win the all-around.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will compete twice this weekend in St. Charles, Missouri before returning home to prepare for the Ivy Classic.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The women’s basketball team faced its toughest two-game home slate of the season with a double-header against Penn and Princeton this weekend. The Quakers (15-7, 8-1 Ivy) were undefeated in conference play and held the number one spot in the Ivy League going into Friday’s game. The test was no easier for the Bears (14-9, 5-5 Ivy) Saturday against second-place Princeton (13-9, 7-2), which was on a six game winning streak before the weekend contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears flirted with wins in both matchups but fell to the Ivy League cream-of-the crop twice in the weekend’s action.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno began Friday’s game by launching an offensive blitzkrieg on the unsuspecting Quakers early. The Bears shot 4-5 from three and poured in 28 points in the first quarter, matching their previous season high. Penn tallied only 13 points in the opening quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The biggest thing for us was just playing loose, playing our style … we knew we had nothing to lose, really, and that’s when we play our best,” said forward Erika Steeves ’19. “We just lit it up in the first quarter, which is what we’re capable of doing,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After raining in 28 in the opening ten minutes, the Bears failed to eclipse 17 points in any of the following stanzas.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Penn nailed back-to-back threes and forced Brown into bad shots to cut the lead to 34-29 in the second quarter. Then, an elbow jumper by a wide open Princeton’s Princess Aghayere cut the lead to three.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Penn gave Brown fits on the offensive glass. Quaker junior Michelle Nwokedi grabbed eight offensive boards in the game en route to a 21-12 double-double. As a team, Bruno snagged only seven offensive rebounds.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Still, Bruno led at the halftime break with a score of 39-33 over the league-leading Quakers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the third quarter, Penn continued to dominate in the low post, drawing mismatches and finishing layups. With about five minutes to play in the third act, back-to-back blocks by Penn led to a deep arching three by the Quakers, cutting Bruno’s lead to one.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Penn later hit a transition three after a turnover. Then, Anna Ross of the Quakers picked off an errant Brown pass and drove to the hoop for an and one. Ross converted the three-point play to give Penn its first lead of the game, 50-49.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We didn’t stay composed at the right times. We were a little bit frantic in the third quarter,” said captain Megan Reilly ’18.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As has been the case all season, Bruno showed a willingness to get on the floor and fight for possession. In the final play of the quarter, Shayna Mehta ’19 showed tremendous effort by picking off an inbound pass and laying it in to cut the deficit. Penn led Brown 53-51 going into the final ten minutes of action.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The game stayed tight in the fourth as the two foes swapped the lead several times. The contest was knotted at 68 with 1:05 to play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown was able to stay in the game thanks to Steeves, who rolled her ankle in the third quarter but got it taped up and played the remainder of the game. She scored ten in the final quarter on 6-6 shooting from the field.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Earlier in the week, Steeves said that assistant coach Danielle Pearson was telling her that shooting was all about confidence. After nailing two of her first three long-range efforts in the first quarter, Steeves had the early hot hand. She notched a career-high 27 points on 10-14 shooting, including five threes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Steeves attributes some of her success to the game plan. She said that the team prepared for Penn’s zone defense all week. In order to get open shots, the Bears would have to find space in the high post and knock down mid-range jumpers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They did just that. “They have some really tall girls in there so we knew getting easy layups would be hard, but the jumpers are open and so are the threes,” Steeves said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Steeves’ gritty effort was not enough for the Bears, and the Quakers escaped with a 71-68 win.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We know that we could hang in there with them, so we just got to keep our heads up and stay confident, and hopefully we get to see them again in the tournament,” Reilly said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“That’s the best we’ve played Penn in several years,” said Head Coach Sarah Behn. “I feel like we had the game and just let it slip in the last couple minutes.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I don’t really love moral victories; I’d rather have a real victory, but there’s definitely some … progress and growth going on with my young team. I think we gained confidence even though we lost,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next day’s game proved as big of a challenge for the Bears. Princeton came into the Pizzitola Sports Center Saturday having not lost a game since January 13, when Brown bested them at home in a 98-88 shootout.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The game was competitive from the outset, and Brown kept it close thanks to seven consecutive points by Taylor Will ’19 in the first quarter. Bruno trailed 22-17 after the first stanza.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown was always playing catch-up from there. In the second quarter, Justine Gaziano ’20 drew it level with a three. Then, after a 15-7 run by the Tigers, the Bears clawed their way back to tie the game at 37 apiece. Princeton took a 41-39 advantage into the second half.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno came out sluggish after halftime, and the Tigers outscored the Bears 20-11 in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Janie White ’18 had her hands full on the defensive end with Bella Alarie and Leslie Robinson. But she stepped up admirably, blocking two shots and grabbing two steals in just 12 minutes of play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Down by 11 with 5:38 to play in the game, Behn instituted a full-court press. Bruno’s relentless defensive effort yielded five steals in the final quarter and sliced the lead to two with 1:38 to play in the game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We had to do something to change the momentum,” Behn said. “I was proud of the kids that we fought back, found a way to make it a game and even had a chance to pull it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Princeton fended off the Brown comeback and grabbed their seventh straight Ivy League win with an 81-75 victory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gaziano led all players with 24 points, and Mehta added 21 of her own.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The loss moved Brown to 5-5 in the conference, putting them in a tie for fourth place, the final spot for a postseason tournament bid.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it is never good to leave a weekend with two losses, Behn is hopeful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This is a journey we’re on,” she said. “Overall, it’s not the result I wanted but it’s definitely steps forward as we close the gap on the top teams in the conference.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears have just four more regular season games. Next week, Bruno will host its final home double header against Dartmouth (6-17, 1-9) and Harvard (19-4, 7-3).</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">Heading into another weekend double-header against Ivy League opponents Penn and Princeton, the men’s basketball team looked to reverse a trend of disappointing performances at home and capture pivotal wins to keep its postseason aspirations alive.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On Friday, despite keeping the game competitive in the early stages, the Bears (11-15, 2-8 Ivy) could not recover from a 27-2 run by the Quakers (11-12, 4-6) to close the first half, resulting in a 96-72 loss. The following day against the Tigers (17-6, 10-0), Brown’s offense struggled in the first half, putting up just 17 points and setting the course for the Tigers’ eventual 66-51 victory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We played hard but just couldn’t get it done,” said starting forward Travis Fuller ’19. “Penn and Princeton are both good teams, but we didn’t play up to our potential. We show signs of how good we can be at times — we just have to do it for 40 minutes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Friday’s game was competitive from the gun. Despite Penn taking a slight lead early on, the score was even at 25 with 7:31 to go in the first half. Until then, Bruno had enjoyed a shower of three-pointers from multiple players, including point guard Brandon Anderson ’20 and co-captains Steven Speith ’17 and J.R. Hobbie ’17.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But then the Quakers laid down an offensive surge, going on a 27-2 run to close out the first half. Ryan Bentley scored eight points over this period, and Penn led 52-27 at intermission.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears benefited from a 9-0 run to start the second half but still trailed by 16. This deficit would prove insurmountable for Bruno, and, as Penn’s onslaught was reignited, Brown could not close the gap, eventually losing 96-72. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Speith led scoring for the Bears in the loss, netting 26 points and draining five three-pointers in the process. But in overall field goal percentage, Penn prevailed, shooting 57 percent to Bruno’s 40 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears had less than 24 hours to shake the difficult loss, with a game against first-place Princeton the next day.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The focus was just to stick to the plan,” Fuller said. “We work so hard in practice every week so that we’re ready to go.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Bears started slow from the opening whistle, allowing the Tigers to build momentum with a 6-0 run in the opening minutes. Midway into the first half, Brown had only notched 10 points to the Tigers’ 19. And after back-to-back threes from Princeton’s Steve Cook with 9:39 and 8:46 remaining, Brown trailed by 15. As the first half buzzer sounded, the Bears were down 33-17.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I wouldn’t say scoring was our problem,” Fuller said. “We needed to put together more stops. Our offense is very effective.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the second half, the Bears’ offense regrouped, with Speith notching 11 of his 17 points in that period. With both teams exchanging blows, Brown outscored Princeton 34-33 in the second period. But the surge in offensive productivity was insufficient to bring Brown back into the game, and the Bears fell 66-51.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown now ranks last in the Ivy League standings — two spots down from last week — with only four games remaining in the regular season.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This coming weekend, Brown will hit the road for its final two away games against Dartmouth Friday and Harvard Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno has already played both teams once so far. Though Bruno led both the Crimson and the Big Green at the half in each matchup, the Bears fell in both contests 87-74 and 77-74, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Harvard and Dartmouth are good teams but we’ll be ready,” Fuller said. “It is our three captains’ last road trip, so we’re going to come out ready to go.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These are two must-win rematches for the Bears if they want to remain in contention for a spot in the inaugural four-team Ivy League Tournament at The Palestra in Philadelphia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The matchups also represent good opportunities for Bruno to correct earlier mistakes and build confidence heading into the final week of the regular season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We want to go 4-0 to put ourselves in a position to make it to the playoff,” Fuller said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For fans hoping to see a repeat of the men’s lacrosse team’s storybook season a year ago, this year’s Bears are one small step of the way there.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Just as the team did in 2016, No. 9 Brown (1-0) opened its season with a commanding victory over Quinnipiac (0-1). Sunday’s 25-9 victory was the first for Head Coach Mike Daly, who was hired from Tufts University in the off-season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“That felt good,” Daly said after the game. “These guys have been unbelievable since day one. They took our entire coaching staff in and they’ve just been a joy to be around.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno enjoyed solid performances from many of the household names featured on last year’s team, as well as from several newcomers. Dylan Molloy ’17, 2016 Tewaaraton Award winner, led the way with eight points — a balanced four-goal, four-assist effort. Luke McCaleb ’20 had four goals and three assists, and Jack Kniffin ’20 scored six of his own, adding an assist. Both complemented Molloy on the attack, while 2016 first team USILA All-American midfielder Larken Kemp ’17 added one goal and three assists.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Also turning in a solid performance in his first collegiate appearance was goalie Phil Goss ’20, who made seven saves in 41 minutes of play. The Herald previously reported that Daly indicated the goalie position was up for grabs leading up to the first contest. Peter Scott ’17 finished out the game in net, making three saves in 18 minutes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Daly’s signature coaching style was on display with Brown pushing the pace at every opportunity. Kniffin and Molloy scored 20 seconds apart to open the game, and the 2-1 margin that followed after the Bobcats’ first goal was as close as the game would get.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When (the new coaching staff) got here, we talked about playing even faster,” Daly said. “The guys have really taken it all in and put it out on the field. They’re a great group — they’re great lacrosse players, and it makes my job pretty easy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the first game of his senior season, Molloy drew significant attention from the Quinnipiac defense. After enduring intense off-season rehab to regain strength after surgery and breaking a bone in his foot in the NCAA tournament last season — an injury he played through in the semifinal loss to Maryland — Molloy appeared to be at full strength Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It definitely felt great just to get back out there with the team,” Molloy said. “Coming off the injury, it was exciting just to pick up that first ball and put the ball in the net for the first time.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Coming off an NCAA tournament berth last season, the Bobcats were thought to present a strong challenge to Brown in each team’s opener. Quinnipiac was picked as the pre-season favorite in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, and attackman Foster Cuomo was picked as the MAAC preseason co-player of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears had no trouble with Cuomo — who was limited to one goal on five shots — and dominated nearly every aspect of the game from the opening faceoff. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’d be lying if I said we saw that coming,” Daly said of the final 16-goal margin. “That’s a great team and a well-coached team. Hats off to our players — I thought they did an unbelievable job.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“You never know really — you hope you can go out every time and just come out with a win,” Molloy said. “But to come out with that many goals just shows that we’ve been practicing hard and doing what we need to do as a team.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ted Ottens ’18 handled a majority of the faceoffs for the Bears, winning 20 of 25. Bruno also handled loose balls with ease, accruing a 53-38 advantage in ground balls.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bobcats goalie Jack Brust faced an onslaught of pressure from Brown, making 15 saves on 38 shots. By the game’s end, Bruno totaled 41 shots on goal to Quinnipiac’s 19.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Their goalie played an unbelievable game,” Daly said. “That game could have been out of control quicker if it wasn’t for that guy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown led 10-3 at halftime, and Daly sidelined the Bears’ starters after the third quarter ended with Brown winning 20-7. In total, 14 players registered a point for Bruno. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team will continue non-conference play, hosting Stony Brook Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The women’s lacrosse team opened its 2017 campaign with a 19-0 trouncing of Sacred Heart Saturday at Stevenson-Pincince Field. Bruno avenged last season’s loss to the Pioneers while posting its first shutout since 1982 against Division III Bridgewater State.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mikaela Karlsson ’18 made her first career start in goal, stopping all nine shots on goal in 53 minutes of play. Maggie Bigelow ’20 entered the game for the final seven minutes but did not face a shot, preserving the shutout for the Bears (2-0). Defensively, Brown forced eight turnovers and frustrated the Pioneers’ (0-1) attack, which struggled to generate scoring opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It says great things about Mikaela and really great things about the whole program,” said Head Coach Keely McDonald ’00. “A shutout goes to the defense, it goes to the attackers who are scoring goals, it goes to the sidelines — it’s really a team effort.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I guess nobody was expecting (the shutout),” Karlsson said. “I was trying not to think about it too much and not jinx it at halftime. You just try to stay in the moment.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown enjoyed contributions from several different players offensively, with Hafsa Moinuddin ’19 leading the way with five goals and an assist. Moinuddin wasted no time after the opening draw, recording a natural hat trick in the first five minutes to give Brown a 3-0 lead. Eight different Brown players notched at least a goal in the contest, with Carolyn Paletta ’18.5, Zoe Verni ’19 and Grace Plassche ’19 all netting three goals each.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “It was great to have contributions from so many different people and to execute all the different aspects that we’ve been working on,” McDonald said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears led 12-0 at the half and held a 26-7 advantage in shots, never looking back after Moinuddin’s strong start. Refusing to take its foot off the gas, Brown kept the pressure on the Pioneers until the final buzzer, notching its final goal with just 49 seconds to play. Paige Hammick faced 26 shots on net in total for Sacred Heart, recording just seven saves.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown had the advantage in nearly every statistical category, including advantages in shots, ground balls, clears and turnovers caused.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A 90-second shot clock was implemented for women’s college lacrosse starting this season, resetting only with a shot on goal, a save or a change of possession. But with scoring chances coming easily, the timer presented little difficulty for the Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We handled it well,” McDonald said. “It doesn’t change anything for catching and throwing, so we work on our fundamentals. We work on our shooting and all of those things. The shot clock is really exciting for fans. It’s really fun to be a part of a new era for women’s lacrosse.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“They love it,” Karlsson said. “For our defense especially, it’s like a new goal. We know that if we do our job for 90 seconds, we’re going to get the ball back.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thanks to stifling defense from Brown, the Pioneers failed to shoot before the 90-second clock ran out on several occasions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">McDonald pulled several members of the Brown starting lineup for substitutes in the second half of the contest. Twenty-four different players entered the game by the final whistle for Bruno.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Being able to spread out playing time was amazing, McDonald said. “These women work so hard, so to get to wear the jersey on the game field — there’s nothing like it.” The Bears continued their hot start to the season with a win over Holy Cross Tuesday, beating the Crusaders 9-4.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown will continue early season play, traveling to Orlando, Florida to take on Louisville Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The men’s hockey team was unable to snap its losing streak this weekend, falling to Dartmouth Friday and No. 3 Harvard Saturday by tallies of 5-4 and 6-0, respectively.</p>
<p class="p1">Friday night, Bruno (4-21-2, 3-16-1 ECAC) was unable to maintain an early two-goal lead over Dartmouth (10-14-3, 7-11-2) acquired in the first three and a half minutes of play. Brent Beaudoin ’20 scored twice in the third stanza, but the Bears could not close the three-goal deficit posted by the Big Green.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sometimes when you get a lead right off the bat, you have a tendency to relax,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “We relaxed and let Dartmouth dictate and get back into the game.”</p>
<p class="p1">Tyler Bird ’18 and Sam Lafferty ’18 opened scoring with one goal apiece in the first frame. Bird sent a shot towards goaltender Devin Buffalo that found the back of the net after deflecting off a defenseman at 1:09. Zach Giuttari ’20 and Ben Tegtmeyer ’18 each picked up assists on the play. Two minutes later, Lafferty slotted the puck past Buffalo off a volley of passes with Max Willman ’18.</p>
<p class="p1">Dartmouth tied it up at two by the end of the first frame before notching another three consecutive goals in the second and third periods for a 5-2 advantage going into the final ten minutes. Bruno fell victim to the Big Green’s power play twice, conceding goals to Grant Opperman and Troy Crema. Opperman sent three shots past Gavin Nieto ’20 for the hat trick before Tim Ernst ’17 took to the crease halfway through the contest.</p>
<p class="p1">“We came out real well and then kind of got away from our game a little bit,” Beaudoin said. “We don’t want to be playing from behind … we’ve got to come out ready.”</p>
<p class="p1">Beaudoin fired a shot past Buffalo off a setup from Tyler Wood ’17 at 12:53 in the third period, narrowing the deficit. After the Bears pulled Ernst for the extra skater with three and a half minutes remaining, Beaudoin scored off assists from Josh McArdle ’18 and Lafferty for his second of the evening. Bird made a last minute attempt to even the tally, but the crossbar preserved the score.</p>
<p class="p1">“The resolve’s good — the urgency is good when we’re down,” Whittet said. “I just don’t know why we have to wait until we’re down in order to play with that energy.”</p>
<p class="p1">The following night saw Brown honor its departing seniors in its final contest at Meehan this season. Zack Pryzbek ’17, Davey Middleton ’17, Andrew Doane ’17, Aleksi Rossi ’17, Wood and Ernst started against the Crimson, instead of the previous day’s lineup that featured Willman, Lafferty, Charlie Corcoran ’18, Joe Maguire ’20, McArdle and Nieto.</p>
<p class="p1">No. 3 Harvard (20-5-2, 14-4-2) posted three goals in the opening 20 minutes Saturday, slotting the puck past Ernst 28 seconds into the game for the early advantage. After Brown replaced Ernst with Nieto in the crease at the beginning of the second stanza, the Crimson scored another three unanswered goals to widen its lead to six in the third. Ernst made 12 saves before giving way to Nieto, who stopped 16 shots in the loss. Harvard outshot Brown 34-23 in the contest.</p>
<p class="p1">“We just need people to start shooting more,” Beaudoin said. “What it comes down to is having the confidence to take a shot when you’re in a certain area instead of passing it off.”</p>
<p class="p1">The Bears are currently missing three key defensemen — Max Gottlieb ’19, Brady Schoo ’19 and Connor Wynne ’19 —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>due to injuries. Forward Tommy Marchin ’19 is also out for the remainder of the season with a broken hand.</p>
<p class="p1">“Those three defensemen can all move the puck out of our zone,” Whittet said. “We just seem to get hemmed in way too much.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Zone time is going to lead to offensive opportunities,” he added.</p>
<p class="p1">The Bears are nearing the end of their season, with one weekend remaining before the ECAC playoffs. “We’re going to be good in playoffs,” Beaudoin said. “We just need to keep our head high and play our game.”</p>
<p class="p1">The Bears close out their season this weekend with visits to Princeton and Quinnipiac.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">While most students used their long weekend to catch up on sleep or homework, the gymnastics team traveled to St. Charles, Missouri for two meets.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Friday, the Bears tallied a season-high team score of 193.350 in the GymQuarters Invitational, a quad meet that included Lindenwood University, Nebraska and Seattle Pacific University. As a visiting team, Bruno began on the floor exercise before moving to vault, bars and ending on beam. The Bears edged out Seattle Pacific to claim third in the tournament. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Floor was the Bears’ forte, as five out of six gymnasts posted career-high scores. Morgan Hagenbuch ’19 opened the competition with a 9.600, and Maggie McAvoy ’18 followed up with a personal best of 9.550. Julia Green ’19 and Anne Christman ’20 topped their previous bests with a 9.575 and a 9.775, respectively. Anya Olson ’18 notched her highest floor score yet as well, a 9.800. To end a record-setting rotation, Caroline Morant ’17 became only the third gymnast in Brown’s history to score a 9.925 on floor, earning second place. Morant tied a program high set by Olympian Alicia Sacramone in 2007, which was also matched by Danielle Hoffman ’15 in 2014. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I definitely had a lot more confidence watching everyone else do such good routines before me,” Morant said of her near-perfect performance. “I remember thinking, ‘Wow, that was probably one of the best routines I’ve done.’” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After combining the top five scores, the Bears earned a season-high 48.675 and turned to the vault. Jorden Mitchell ’17 made her first appearance of the season on vault, earning a 9.550. Green put up a 9.625 followed by Olson, who tied her personal best of 9.575, bringing the team total to 96.400. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Claire Ryan ’18 started the Bears off with a 9.675 on the uneven bars, while Olson tied her personal best of 9.775. A season-high 48.500 on bars brought the team total to 144.900 going into the final event. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the second week in a row, Christman performed a solid beam routine to earn a 9.650. The team built on her score with 9.700s from Green and Mitchell. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Morant finished third in the all-around and the Bears ended up in third place behind Nebraska and Lindenwood. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With only a day’s break in between, the team chalked up for another competition against Lindenwood and Seattle Pacific Sunday. Mitchell earned a 9.725 on beam to start, leading the team to a 48.225 before moving to the floor. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Keeping with Friday’s trend, McAvoy raised her personal best score to a 9.600. Christman received an identical score, and Olson put up a 9.750. Morant contributed a 9.850 to capture third on the event and bring the team score to 96.500. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno had a steady vault rotation that featured a 9.725 from Green, sandwiched between a pair of 9.600s from Ally Rudd ’20 and Olson. A season high 48.350 put the team in second place, leading Seattle Pacific by a full point with a team score of 144.850 going into the last rotation. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After seven rotations spanning two days of competition, the team finished its busy weekend on the uneven bars, where Olson tied her career-high and earned third place with a 9.775. Brown’s last routine in Missouri belonged to Morant, who scored a 9.750. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team finished in second with a 193.325, besting Seattle Pacific by over a point. Morant claimed the all-around title again, with a 39.025. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It definitely boosted our confidence because we got our top two scores of the season this weekend, and we proved that we can be consistent,” Morant said. “Now we know we can hit our routines, and it’s just a matter of polishing and cleaning things up. We’re all really excited.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The next time the Bears compete will be at Yale Saturday for the Ivy Classic, where Brown hopes to defend its title from last season. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">When we think about professional athletes, we think about fame, glamour and multi-million-dollar salaries. Baseball may be the richest sport of them all, as 28 of the 30 largest sports <a href="weblink: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_sports_contracts">contracts of all time belong to baseball players</a>, but this perception ignores the players who never make it big. These are most common in baseball as well, given its extensive minor league system which pays players less than minimum wage. Even in the major leagues, a player’s team can cut him without owing another cent at the end of any of his first six seasons, providing little security for players at the beginning of their careers. This system of annually escalating salaries has led to riches for many, but has left those who do not play well enough or get hurt without anything to fall back on.</p>
<p class="p3">But there is another option for young players: signing an extension that guarantees a salary for those six years, even if it means making less than the player can expect if he succeeds. Staying on one-year contracts might increase the amount a player makes on average,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but missing out on an even bigger payday by signing an extension is a much smaller concern than potentially not getting paid at all if a player falls short of expectations and is cut immediately.</p>
<p class="p3">For each of a player’s first three seasons in the major leagues, he makes roughly the minimum salary, which is about $500,000. After that, he enters arbitration, where his pay is determined by what comparable players earned at that stage in the past. He is under arbitration for an additional three years before reaching free agency after his sixth season. But under this system, a player is at the complete mercy of his team, which can choose not to offer him a contract after any of those six seasons and leave him without any guaranteed money. Extensions usually cover these six years plus at least one team option, where the team can choose to pay the player a certain amount for another year or allow him to become a free agent.</p>
<p class="p3">The perfect example of how extensions can make a huge difference for a player is Houston Astros first baseman Jon Singleton. Before reaching the major leagues in 2014, Singleton signed an eight-year contract extension that guaranteed him $10 million total. The first five years were fully guaranteed, followed by three team options that, if all exercised, would pay him an additional $20.5 million. Because he did not play a full major league season in 2014, the contract covered all six of his original team-controlled years and one free-agent season. The final team option was worth $13 million, so Singleton was only going to make about $17 million for his team-controlled years even if he was successful.</p>
<p class="p3">This would have been a serious discount if Singleton, then one of the top prospects in baseball, had lived up to his potential. By way of comparison, good-but-not-great first baseman Eric Hosmer will have made $31 million for his six team-controlled years when he becomes a free agent after the 2017 season and will likely sign a free agent deal that pays him more than $13 million annually for 2018 and for a few years after that.</p>
<p class="p3">But Singleton fell far short of his potential. Through two major league seasons, he had an abysmal .171 batting average and was removed from the Astros’ major league roster. Had he not signed an extension, he would likely have earned under $1 million for his two partial major league seasons and washed out of the game forever. The difference between $1 million and $10 million is massive — much greater than the difference between $10 million and $30 million when it comes to quality of life.</p>
<p class="p3">This guarantee means even more when you realize how little else these players have. Singleton was drafted out of high school, heavily limiting his job opportunities for after his playing career ends. Some players receive huge draft bonuses — the 2016 first overall pick, Mickey Moniak, received $6.1 million — and have little need for the financial security of an extension. But Singleton was an eighth-round pick and was paid a $200,000 bonus, which seems like a good amount until you realize he had to stretch that out over his five minor league seasons. With players earning under $10,000 annually in the minors, he had little else to supplement his bonus. The difference between entering a life after baseball with $1 million in the bank versus $10 million is gargantuan.</p>
<p class="p3">In the interest of full disclosure, Singleton is the only notable example of a player becoming an absolute bust after signing an extension. But he is also one of very few players to sign his extension before reaching the major leagues. Most examples of extensions that hugely limited a player’s future earnings were given to players with at least one MLB season under their belt, during which they proved themselves to be deserving of a long-term investment. And there are quite a few who have really gotten screwed: Chris Sale, Adam Eaton, Evan Longoria, José Altuve and Anthony Rizzo, to name a few. Extensions make sense for minor leaguers who have never had the chance to succeed or fail in the majors, not proven MLB players.</p>
<p class="p3">For players who have spent years toiling in the minor leagues for a pittance, an extension represents a golden opportunity to lock down a long-awaited payday. But these deals are very rare, as players hold out in hopes of making even more money down the road. For men with little savings and limited career prospects outside of baseball, the security of an extension is far better than taking a gamble for even more money.</p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Lebron James, MVP</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Terrific individual performances have been a staple of the current NBA season, as Russell Westbrook and James Harden have compiled monster numbers thus far. Westbrook is on a path to averaging a triple-double for the season and would be the first player to do so since Oscar Robertson in the 1961-1962 season. Meanwhile, Harden could lead the league in points and assists per game — he currently sits at third in points and first in assists in the NBA — a feat not accomplished since Nate Archibald’s 1972-1973 season. The pair has totaled 40 triple-doubles, 26 of those by Westbrook, while Harden enjoyed the finest statistical performance of the season with 53 points, 16 rebounds and 17 assists.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Accordingly, this year’s MVP discussion has centered on Westbrook and Harden. It makes sense. There has even been some mention of the Warriors’ Kevin Durant, who is among the NBA’s best in points per game and shooting percentage and also plays for the league’s best team.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the game’s greatest player, Lebron James, has been forgotten in all the MVP talk. James’ basic statistical averages, while unbelievable, simply don’t jump off the page like Westbrook’s or Harden’s, and his MVP candidacy has suffered in turn.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is important to acknowledge that even in the context of the Harden and Westbrook’s historic seasons, James is putting forth his own entry into the record books. His 8.8 assists per game are the most ever by a non-guard. But there is more to basketball than just the basic statistics, and when one examines James’ case more closely, the choice for MVP becomes far more clear.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">James has a storied NBA career, and last year he led the Cavaliers to the NBA Championship, upsetting the Warriors after trailing three games to one, the greatest comeback in NBA history. This year, the Cavaliers are again one of the NBA’s few contenders. That is, when James is on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Over the past two and a half seasons, the Cavaliers have gone 4-18 when James has not played. Not only are they not contenders — as one would expect with the loss of James — but they are simply dreadful. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those who find advanced statistics more convincing, as is common in the current analytics-driven NBA, the numbers bear this phenomenon out as well. With James on the court, the Cavaliers have a 7.8 point advantage over their opponents per 100 possessions. With Lebron on the bench, Cleveland is outscored by 4.4 points per 100 possessions. That is a 12.2 point difference.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is a different story with Kyrie Irving, the star of last year’s Cavalier playoff run. Even those who criticize James’ MVP campaign because of his star teammate should note only a 4.9 point difference per 100 possessions for Irving. It just goes to show how dominant James truly is, even when compared to one of the NBA’s stars.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As impressive as Harden’s season has been, the difference between the Rockets with Harden on and off the court — 3.5 points per 100 possessions — does not come close to James’ numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Westbrook is the one man who has Lebron beat in this statistic, with a 13.6 point difference per 100 possessions. Much of that is due to how terrible the Thunder bench has been, as opponents outscore Oklahoma City by an astonishing 10.9 points per 100 possessions with Westbrook off the court.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Much has been made of Westbrook’s efforts to carry the Thunder into the playoffs, and he has done incredibly well, dragging a lackluster team into the seventh place in the Western Conference. But for all Westbrook has accomplished, the Thunder are still expected to be quickly dispatched in its first round series.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Harden has taken a Rockets team, albeit one far more talented than Oklahoma City, all the way to the third seed. But the Rockets are far from a guarantee to make the Finals, still behind the timeless Spurs and the Warriors in the Western Conference standings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Only James has the talent to take a bad team to the Finals, as he did in 2007. The Cavaliers are in control of the Eastern Conference, sitting pretty in first place and remaining the prohibitive favorites to reach the NBA’s championship yet again. This year’s trip would be Lebron’s seventh consecutive appearance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before we get too caught up in Westbrook and Harden’s successes, let’s keep in mind who the real MVP is: Lebron James.</span></p>

		<title>Zoe Phillips ’20 eclipses school record at Ivy Championships</title>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Amidst the thunderous cheers echoing about the Katherine Moran Coleman Aquatics Center during the Ivy League Swimming and Diving Championship, one member of Brown’s swimming and diving team could be found slicing though the water at record pace, adding double digits to Bruno’s point total.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">First year phenomenon Zoe Phillips ’20 competed in multiple events for the Bears over the course of the meet, including the 200m backstroke and 200m individual medley. But in the 400m individual medley, Phillips made her biggest impact, placing fifth with a time of 4:17.98, breaking the school record by nearly a second. The Salt Lake City native also beat the NCAA B standard to potentially qualify her for a spot in the NCAA Championships March 15.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For her critical contributions to the team and record-setting achievements over the course of the Ivy League Championships, Phillips has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: What was it like breaking the record? Could you immediately tell it was going to be a fast time?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Phillips: I definitely didn’t know I was breaking a record, but it was great to look up and see my team and coaches cheering when I touched the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What’s it like competing in so many events and in so many heats over just a few days? How do you have time to recover?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We take a lot of ice baths. But we actually race a lot less in college than in high school.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How was the energy different in the Ivy League Championships compared to a normal meet?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Ivy League Championships are different because you look around and see all these incredible women who are both great athletes and have amazing academic achievements. Everyone has given up something for swimming, so it’s great to come together and celebrate the time we’ve spent training.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Taking a step back, when did you start swimming and what got you into the sport?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My twin sister and I started swimming when we were eight, and my mom played water polo at (Berkeley), and she now swims recreationally. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I chose Brown because I really value academics and a lot of other state universities require six hours a day of training. I wouldn’t have had the time for that if I wanted to be in an engineering program. At Brown, the swimming level is high, but it wouldn’t be overwhelming for me.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Having already had so much success, where do you see yourself in the future?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before this weekend, I hadn’t gotten a personal record in two years, so this was a huge deal for me. I have definitely begun to love the sport just for the journey, not just about the success of it. I’m just excited to continue swimming with these amazing girls and my amazing coaches and hopefully get another time next year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Finally, from a team standpoint, what are some goals to work toward?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We placed fifth, which was the highest we have been in 15 years. I could not be prouder of my team. They are such hard workers and I am going to miss the seniors a lot next year.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Less than a week after returning from Missouri, the gymnastics team traveled to Yale for the Ivy Classic Saturday, a quad meet including Penn and Cornell. Though the Bears finished in fourth with a 192.400, five gymnasts earned All-Ivy Classic honors on multiple events. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the reigning Ivy Classic champions, Brown entered the competition as the team to beat. Jorden Mitchell ’17 posted a season-high 9.775 on the vault to claim third, and Caroline Morant ’17 notched a 9.825 to capture the title. Both received first team All-Ivy Classic accolades for the event, and the team finished the rotation with a season-high 48.350. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Vault hasn’t been our strongest event this season, but we did really well,” Mitchell said. “That gave us a lot of confidence going into bars.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That confidence was evident as Anya Olson ’18 upped her personal best to 9.825 and earned second, while Morant nabbed first with a season-high 9.850. The pair was recognized with first-team<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>honors on bars. At the competition’s midpoint, the Bears led the field by two tenths of a point with a 96.800. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prior to the championship, the Bears put extra emphasis on balance beam training as “it tends to be the most mentally challenging,” Mitchell said. More often than not, results are decided on the four-inch-apparatus. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Competing in a championship meet is definitely a different experience than a regular season meet, especially on beam,” Mitchell said. “Beam can make or break a competition.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite a few nervous missteps, three gymnasts nailed their beam routines and were named to All-Ivy teams. Anne Christman ’20 scored a 9.700 and earned second-team distinction, while Regan Butchness ’18 earned a 9.725 and her second-straight second-team recognition. Mitchell finished third on the event with a 9.775, adding first-team honors to her collection. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Going into the final event, Olson said the team had the mindset that they “were going to leave it all out on the floor.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Olson recorded a 9.650 and earned second-team decoration. Morant ended the competition with a 9.775 and first-team recognition on floor. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re going to take what happened and use it as a learning experience,” Olson said of the fourth-place finish. “We’ll take that fire and really bring that to (the ECAC championship) and to the rest of the meets this season.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the end of the championship, Morant earned first-team honors in the all-around and finished third with a 38.550. During their time at Brown, Morant and Mitchell have amassed quite the collection of Ivy Classic event titles and All-Ivy honors: Mitchell boasts three individual titles and eight All-Ivy laurels, while Morant totaled six championship titles and thirteen All-Ivy distinctions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Next week, the Bears will compete at New Hampshire Sunday and the University of Bridgeport Tuesday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The women’s basketball team was back in action this weekend for its final home double-header of the regular season. Bruno (14-11, 5-7 Ivy) faced off against Dartmouth and Harvard — foes it had faced just two weeks earlier in consecutive away games.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both games came down to the wire. Friday’s game against Dartmouth (7-18, 2-10) went into overtime, and Saturday’s contest with Harvard (20-5, 8-4) was decided by only three points. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Brown found itself on the losing side of each game. The two losses round out its four-game winless home stand with just one more weekend of regular season play left.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dartmouth came to Providence sitting in last place in the Ivy league with only one conference win to its name. While the Big Green was out of contention for a postseason bid, it played with passion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears started out with seven unanswered points, but Dartmouth rallied and took a 20-17 lead after the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Early on, the Bears swung the ball around the three-point line until spotting up for an open three or finding a teammate in the low post to lay it in.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the other end, Dartmouth was efficient, shooting 33-61. Bruno, on the other hand, made just one more shot on 17 more attempts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Coach Behn says that we always, always have the green light, and she continues to tell us to keep shooting,” said captain Megan Reilly ’18.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The game was close throughout. Midway through the second quarter, Taylor Will ’19 picked the opposing point guard’s pocket and drove down the floor for a lay in. On the next possession, Mary Butler ’19 hit a transition jumper to knot the game at 30.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Then, Dartmouth started draining shots as Bruno’s offensive rim<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>became unforgiving — every shot seemed to be halfway down the cylinder before bouncing out. This continued until Shayna Mehta ’19 rattled home a deep trey to awaken Bruno from its jump shot slumber.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno shot 6-19 from beyond the arc in the first half. Meanwhile, Dartmouth nailed just one fewer three on 10 fewer shots to secure a 40-36 lead at the halftime break.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The game stayed close in the third quarter as both teams tallied 23 points in the stanza. The lead would change hands 16 times over the course of the night.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With 37 seconds to play, Brown was down 76-72. An inadvertent whistle by the referee stopped a Brown fast break after an Erika Steeves ’19 steal, but, on the ensuing possession, Mehta nailed a three to cut the deficit to one.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno fouled Dartmouth three times, sending Andi Norman to the line with 24.1 seconds to play. She hit her first attempt but missed the second off the back iron. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Justine Gaziano ’20 hit a layup to tie the game at 77 with 12.1 seconds left in regulation, and then back-to-back blocks by Steeves and Butler sent the game into overtime.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Eventually, Dartmouth had the ball up two with 30.3 to play in overtime. The Bears tried to get possession back by fouling, but Dartmouth shot well from the line to seal the 92-88 victory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mehta said the team was “devastated” after the game. “That was a game we should’ve won, and we just didn’t pull through,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mehta said that the weekend’s losses felt worse than the previous weekend’s 0-2 result. These were games that they should have won but were unable to finish, while the losses to Penn and Princeton were encouraging because they showed that the team could hang with anybody, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mehta led the way for the Bears on the night, scoring 20 points and grabbing nine rebounds. Each of Brown’s starting five scored double-digit points. Steeves, Gaziano, Will and Butler added 19, 17, 15 and 10, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There were postseason implications on the line when Brown hosted Harvard Saturday. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The game was tight. Butler blocked a shot as the clock ran out to keep the score at 17-15 after the first 10 minutes. But Harvard started out the second stanza with an 11-2 run, prompting Behn to take a timeout.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown’s adjustments proved successful, and defensive effort by the Bears brought the game within one until Harvard nailed a three-pointer with six seconds left in the half to stretch the Crimson lead to four, 33-29.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown trailed for most of the third quarter until Reilly zipped a baseball pass to Mehta, who created separation with a pump fake and hit a short range jumper to lock the game at 41 with just over two minutes to play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Harvard dominated the offensive glass all night but often missed its second chances, which kept the game close.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the fourth, Mehta once again tied the game, this time with back-to-back threes, but the Crimson answered to take a two-point lead into the game’s final 40 seconds. Again, Bruno’s foes were effective from the line, and Harvard was able to close out a 66-63 victory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Steeves led the Bears with 21 points in the loss. Mehta and Gaziano tallied 16 and 14, respectively. Steeves was prolific during the four-game home stand, averaging 19 points and seven rebounds per contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The two losses move the Bears to fifth place in the Ivy League. In order to punch its ticket to the Palestra for the Ivy League Tournament, Bruno has to win next weekend’s games on the road against Columbia (13-12, 3-9) and Cornell (15-10, 6-6).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We are trying not to think too far ahead,” Reilly said. “We need to focus on each game one at a time, one half at a time, one quarter at a time, one possession at a time.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The No. 9/10 men’s lacrosse team suffered a disappointing 25-17 defeat against unranked Stony Brook University Saturday. The loss comes after a dominant 25-9 victory against Quinnipiac University to open the season the week before.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dylan Molloy ’17 led the Bears with four goals in the losing effort, while Michael Panepinto ’19 and Jack Kniffin ’20 both contributed hat tricks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Seawolves (3-0) jumped out to an 8-0 lead after the first quarter, a deficit the Bears (1-1) could not erase despite a second half rally. The first quarter saw Stony Brook dominate possession and control the pace of play, winning seven of nine face-off opportunities in the opening frame. Bruno could only muster four shots in the first 15 minutes compared to 21 first quarter shots the week before.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite entering the second quarter down eight goals and off the scoreboard, Bruno rebounded, with Molloy opening the scoring for the Bears at the 13:52 mark. After the slow start, Brown cut the lead to four at the midway point, trailing 10-6.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno came out of the gates strong in the second half, outscoring Stony Brook 3-1 in the first four minutes of the third to cut the lead to 11-9. But Stony Brook’s deliberate offense, marked by strong cuts through Brown defense, regained its first quarter form, as the Seawolves proceeded on an 8-2 run. At the start of the fourth, Bruno found itself in an eight-goal deficit, down 19-11.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After trailing by as many asnine goals, Bruno cut Stony Brook’s lead down to seven in the fourth quarter, which saw the teams trading goals. Each team scored six goals in the final frame.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First-year goalie Phil Goss ’20 posted seven saves on 23 shots in 37 minutes of action before being replaced by Peter Scott ’17, who recorded five saves on 14 shots on net. But despite the best efforts of Bruno’s goalkeepers, the defense could not slow down the Stony Brook attack. Cory Van Ginhoven posed problems all afternoon for the defense, powering Stony Brook forward with seven goals and an assist. Seawolf net-minder Brandon Maciejewski recorded five saves on 22 Bruno shots.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a disappointing performance for sure,” said Head Coach Mike Daly. “As the head coach, the blame rests solely with me. Our team was not prepared to play at the level Stony Brook played at.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown was outshot by 26 in the losing effort and could only muster a little over half the number of shots it took against Quinnipiac.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Daly pointed to an improvement in consistency as the team moves forward. “Whether we had won or lost, it is our goal to constantly be improving (in) all phases, all facets,” Daly said. “We made enough plays, we just didn’t finish those plays.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears have an opportunity to get back on track next Saturday against Rutgers in New Jersey. Bruno has two more non-conference games before Ivy League play kicks off March 18.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heading into its final road weekend of the season, the men’s basketball team looked to avenge previous home losses to Dartmouth and Harvard. Against the Big Green, the Bears (12-16, 3-9 Ivy) found their rhythm, snapping a five-game losing streak and securing an 80-75 win. But against the Crimson, despite co-captain JR Hobbie ’17 tying the Brown record for career three-pointers, the Bears fell 77-58.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears were firing from the starting whistle against the Big Green (6-19, 3-9). In the first nine minutes, Brown put up a 22-10 lead on Dartmouth, with three-pointers from Hobbie, co-captain Tavon Blackmon ’17 and Obi Okolie ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears only continued this blitz as the half progressed, going on a 10-2 run over the next four minutes to take a 34-12 lead. But Dartmouth fought back, closing the gap to 38-27 by the close of the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We played great defense,” said starting forward Travis Fuller ’19. “We had a great start to the game and came in with a lot of energy. We were playing unselfish basketball, and everyone was giving multiple efforts on both ends of the floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Over the course of the second half, both Bruno and the Big Green exchanged blows on offense. But thanks to the cushion that Brown built during the first half, the Big Green could only chip away at Brown’s lead over the second period. With 2:33 remaining, the Bears held a nine-point advantage at 78-67.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Dartmouth rallied, going on a 8-0 run fueled by five points from Taylor Johnson, which cut the lead to just three with under a minute remaining. Brown retook control after Hobbie iced the game at the free throw line, securing the win.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was nice to get a win,” Fuller said. “The atmosphere after a win is awesome.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Blackmon and Steven Spieth ’17 led Bruno offensively, each netting 14 points on the day. Spieth, who currently leads the Ivy League in minutes per game, also tied the Brown record for games started in a career, with 114. Overall, the Bears bested the Big Green in field goal percentage, rebounds, assists and points in the paint to cap a convincing showing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears looked to continue this momentum into their Saturday evening matchup against Harvard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I wouldn’t say it’s hard to bounce back,” Fuller said. “We were ready to go.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Brown started slow, allowing the Crimson to build an 11-2 lead in the opening minutes of the game. The Bears were able to shrink this lead to seven after three-pointers from Spieth and Hobbie, but Harvard’s offense remained unrelenting and built a 40-23 lead with 3:06 left in the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With his 249th career three-pointer at 1:49 in the stanza, Hobbie tied the program record, providing some much needed energy for the Bears as the team entered halftime down 48-30.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fuller remarked that watching Hobbie hit this career milestone “was awesome” for everyone on the Brown team.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have two games left to get him that record, so it’ll be a great moment for him,” Fuller said. “The guy is a gym rat.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the 18-point halftime lead proved insurmountable for the Bears. In the first 10 minutes of the second half, Spieth contributed six points alone, with help from Fuller<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— who led Brown with eight rebounds — and Okolie. The Bears kept pace with Harvard for the second half but ultimately fell 77-58.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will finish the regular season this weekend with two games at home against Columbia Friday and Cornell Saturday. After this weekend, the Bears now share a three-way tie for sixth in the Ivy League standings. With three conference wins, Bruno currently sits two games behind Columbia and Penn, who both currently share the fourth place spot in the conference. “The vibe is still strong,” Fuller said. “We want to end this season going 2-0. We’re a very close group, so every chance that us 15 players get to play together, we’re not gonna take it for granted.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s hockey team closed out its regular season with a pair of losses, falling to Princeton Friday and Quinnipiac Saturday by tallies of 7-2 and 4-1, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday night, Bruno (4-23-2, 3-18-1 ECAC) was unable to recover from an early deficit against the Tigers (13-13-3, 8-11-3). Princeton shut the Bears out in the first two stanzas, notching six consecutive goals before Tyler Bird ’18 and Sam Lafferty ’18 put Brown on the board with a goal apiece in the third period.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I don’t think we came ready to play, and the result was kind of what we gave,” said Charlie Corcoran ’18. “It definitely was a wake-up call.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ryan Kuffner opened scoring for Princeton at 4:45 in the first, sending a shot past goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 on a partial breakaway. Nine minutes later, Max Véronneau got on the board with a one-timer in front to extend the Tigers’ lead to two entering the second period.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Josh Teves and Ben Foster each found the back of the net in the second stanza before Brown replaced Nieto with veteran Tim Ernst ’17 at the midpoint of the period. Eric Robinson slotted a wraparound goal past Ernst at the 12-minute mark, giving the Tigers a 5-0 advantage at the end of the frame.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After David Hallisey scored on the power play 35 seconds into the final stanza, Bird posted the Bears’ first goal of the evening at 7:02, narrowing the deficit. Brent Beaudoin ’20 won the faceoff and sent the puck to Bird, who beat netminder Colton Phinney for the score.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joey Fallon answered with a goal for Princeton before Lafferty scored off the rebound — his twelfth goal of the season — with eight minutes remaining. Corcoran<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Max Willman ’18 each picked up assists on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nieto made 15 saves before giving way to Ernst, who delivered a 21-save performance in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, Bruno evened the score with Quinnipiac (19-13-2, 13-8-1) in the first stanza, but the Bears fell behind in the second period, conceding three unanswered goals in the away contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were two or three mistakes from being right in that game,” Corcoran said. “This late in the season, it is those little mistakes that teams will capitalize on.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nick Germain opened scoring for the Bobcats at 15:38 in the first with a backhanded shot, before Brown responded with the equalizer a minute and a half later. Corcoran collected a rebound and sent the puck past netminder Andrew Shortridge for his team-high 15th goal of the season. Willman recorded an assist on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bobcats notched three unanswered goals in the second stanza to secure their lead before entering a scoreless third period. Bruno killed three penalties in the final frame, grounding Quinnipiac at 0-for-6 on the power play during the contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our penalty kill has been a lot better,” Corcoran said. “We’ve been getting up ice and pressuring teams pretty well, but there have been a couple of needless penalties.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bobcats outshot the Bears 37-19. Nieto made 33 saves in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will pay another visit to fifth-seeded Quinnipiac next weekend for the best-of-three first round of the ECAC playoffs, starting Friday night.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">After a semester off from Brown to travel and volunteer, Carly Paul ’18.5 has returned to track and field with a vengeance.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Paul reintroduced herself to the Ivy League at the conference’s Heptagonal Championships in New York last weekend, at the end of the team’s indoor competition. Paul<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>posted two standout performances in the high jump and pentathlon, placing second and fourth, respectively. After earning a total of 3,618 points in the pentathlon Friday — which consists of the 60-meter hurdles, high jump, shot put, long jump and an 800-meter run<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— Paul cleared a height of 5-08.00<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the following day to take second place in the individual high jump event. Her scores contributed a total of 11 team points to Brown’s total — seven for the high jump and four for the pentathlon.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In 2016, she placed eighth in the heptathlon with a total of 4,712 points at the Ivy League Championship and earned runner-up in the javelin throw and third in the high jump at the Brown Springtime Open. She will return to competition Mar. 24-25 at the North Carolina State Raleigh Relays.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For her significant point contributions in the high jump and pentathlon at Heps last weekend, Paul is The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Herald: What were your expectations going into Heps?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Paul: I actually just came back from a semester off from Brown — I took a semester off instead of going abroad just to travel and volunteer, and so I’ve only been training for a couple of months. My coach and I went into it with a very “what do we have to lose” mindset, and it ended up going really, really well.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>How did your events feel? Did you think that you were on track to place so highly?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The pentathlon is a very different thing from other events because you just have to do all-around okay. I knew that throughout the day I had a really strong start in hurdles, and so that gave me a good rhythm for the whole day. I knew that if I did fairly well in all my events, I should end up on the podium in the pentathlon. (For the high jump), I knew my body would be tired the next day, but I went in ranked second, so I knew there was potential for me to get on the podium. But it was only my third time high-jumping this season. In high jump, there’s less room for error, whereas in the pentathlon, one thing can go okay and the other things can make up for it, so I knew that I could do enough in every event.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>How do you prepare yourself mentally for a meet?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I used to be more of a superstitious person where I had a very big routine — I would always have the same dinner, have the same breakfast kind of thing, but I tore my ACL when I was a freshman. I had knee surgery and coming back from that I just decided to not make any superstitions, so I just kind of tried to make sure I eat well, make sure I get enough sleep. I don’t really have any silly routines anymore because I think that it can be a barrier, like an excuse.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>You compete regularly in all of the pentathlon events. Do you have a favorite?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hurdles and high jump are my favorite events. Hurdles is just fun, and high jump is kind of my baby — it’s always been my main event, so I have a very big love-hate relationship with it. I know it so well that it can be the most frustrating to me but it’s also, at the end of the day, my favorite. The 800 is my favorite and biggest challenge<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— whenever I have success in the 800, it has a lot more gravity than other events because it’s definitely the one I’m learning the most. So whenever I have success in that or an improvement, it’s the most gratifying. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>When did you initially get into the sport?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I started doing track in junior high because my mom high-jumped in high school, and because of that, my brother high-jumped in junior high, and because he did it I was like, “I’m going to do it, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>What’s your go-to meet day breakfast?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If I’m just doing a couple of events, like hurdles and high jump at a normal meet, I try to eat a really big hearty breakfast sandwich — like a bagel with eggs, spinach, sausage and cheese on it. If I’m doing a pentathlon, I basically just try to eat as much as I can possibly eat. So I’ll eat eggs, sausage and toast, and also some yogurt and granola, because you can eat during the pentathlon, but it’s hard. You just have to kind of force yourself to eat, so I try to eat a bunch beforehand.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b> Looking ahead, what are your aims for the upcoming meets?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a team as a whole, we have the potential to do really, really well. I think by outdoor, people will have things sorted out more and I think (where) we’ll have a lot more potential is scoring higher as a team. Personally, I’d love to PR in all my events, that’s what you always say. I’d really love to PR in the heptathlon and I’m really looking forward to working on javelin again. Last year was my first season, so I was just trying to figure it out. Now, I think that I have some basics, (so) it will be fun to work on it more. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">After they were swept in last fall’s American League Division Series, the Boston Red Sox have reported to Fort Myers, Florida for spring training. Expectations for this year’s team have been soaring with the return of last season’s Cy Young Award winner, Rick Porcello, and MVP runner-up, Mookie Betts. While the Red Sox were the offensive leader in almost every category last season, the front office traded for five-time All-Star pitcher Chris Sale, giving the Red Sox three aces in their starting pitching staff in Sale, Porcello and David Price to complement their offense. Despite the Sox’ potent offensive weapons and starting pitchers, their greatest strength lies in their bullpen.</p>
<p class="p2">Great pitching wins championships. As baseball evolves, though, less of that pitching needs to come from the starter, while the bullpen takes on a much heavier role, both eating up innings to get the team through the season and shut<span class="s1">ting down opposing offenses in tight, late-game situations. The Red Sox have a history of overlooking their bullpen needs and having bad luck with the relievers they do get. Often, the Red Sox pass up good relievers for power-hitting righties who have the right swing to hit balls over Fenway’s Green Monster. These acquisitions, like Wily Mo Peña and Yoenis Céspedes, rarely pan out, as the hitters often get too pull-happy and stop hitting for average.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the bullpen last season, the Red Sox got unlucky with the two relievers they acquired in Carson Smith and Craig Kimbrel. Smith needed season-ending Tommy John surgery just one month into the campaign and Kimbrel was ineffective for a large portion of last season due to knee issues. This increased the load for the other pitchers and took a toll toward the end of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The outlook for the Red Sox’ bullpen this season is positive. With Kimbrel — who is now healthy — Joe Kelly and Matt Barnes, they have three pitchers who consistently throw in the high 90s. When Smith returns to the field — probably in June — the Sox will have three quality lefties in the bullpen with Smith, Fernando Abad and Robby Scott. This simply gives the team more options and favorable matchups in close-game situations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are a few key offseason events that led to this year’s bullpen looking so promising. First, Kelly has fully transitioned from a starter to a reliever. Last season, Kelly’s role with the team was in limbo as he spent a chunk of time in the minor leagues with the Red Sox’ AAA team, Pawtucket, as a starter. But late in the season, the team’s needs took him from Pawtucket to the Boston bullpen. Although he was a reliable bullpen arm, his mid-season transition left a lot of room for error in managing him.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another major improvement to the bullpen will be Kimbrel’s recovery. He came to the Red Sox in a blockbuster trade but struggled to get quick outs, especially in non-save situations. He was on the disabled list for about a month in July after knee surgery, and he may have come back too early, as his confidence and command often wavered. The offseason gave Kimbrel a chance to fully recover, and reports from spring training indicate that he is healthy and throwing confidently again. The third key event was the acquisition of Tyler Thornburg from the Milwaukee Brewers. The promising, young pitcher who can handle a hefty workload was a footnote in the offseason that brought in Sale, but his arrival eases the job for the other relievers while giving American League opponents a look that they are unfamiliar with.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the media likes to focus on the stars, like Mookie Betts and Chris Sale, the Red Sox’ relief pitchers may be the players who make the difference between playoff appearances and playoff victories.</span></p>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: The sun shines on baseball</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In Fort Myers, Florida, the winter is over, and signs of the summer ahead have already appeared. In Scottsdale, Arizona, shopkeepers and restaurant owners are in the first days of a month of frantic excitement. And in Port St. Lucie, Florida, a small town has welcomed back its favorite long-time residents for another year.</p>
<p class="p2">These three cities, along with 19 others, are participating in the annual American ritual that is MLB’s spring training. And across the country, millions of fans are doing the same. Slowly but surely, baseball’s offseason is receding; the darkest period has ended, and now we are in the home stretch.</p>
<p class="p2">Espousing my love for spring training, as I do every year around this time, I inevitably come across someone who simply is not as enthusiastic about it as I am. “Why do you care?” they’ll say. Or, “It doesn’t count for anything, it’s meaningless.” Or, worst of all: “There’s no reason to get excited about it.”</p>
<p class="p2">Spring training — that is, the practice among MLB teams of spending a month or so in warmer climes, preparing for an upcoming season — began taking hold in the 1890s. By 1910, it was a widely established and accepted practice. It was already an annual phenomenon that Americans got excited about — so much so that in the 1912 book, “Pitching In A Pinch,” Christy Mathewson, legendary pitcher for the New York Giants, devoted an entire chapter to stories from spring training. It is nearly as old as modern organized baseball itself, and since 1912, it has only gotten better.</p>
<p class="p2">Why do I place so much emphasis on the level of excitement and awareness that spring training generates? Simply to note that if it’s really so meaningless and if there is really no reason to get excited, you’d think everyone who gets excited about it would have figured that out by now.</p>
<p class="p2">But they haven’t, of course, because they’re right. When spring training begins, there is everything to be excited about. The regular season is right down the road, for one, but even beyond that, there’s a lot to like about spring training itself.</p>
<p class="p2">Spring training is everything that makes baseball great. Spring training is warm, sunny days, ice cream in the stands, autographs over fences, picnics in the outfield. Spring training is games that do not count but are all the more fun because of it, two teams made up of players who do not mind the outcome one way or another but just want to have some fun. Spring training is first looks at promising rookies, tenth looks at beloved veterans and, when you put them all together, a new look at a new team. In Spring training, your team comes together for the first time. Everything that happens from April to November — the wild walk-off wins, the diving catches, the complete-game shutouts, the rookie who comes out of nowhere to become a star — starts down in Florida and Arizona in February.</p>
<p class="p2">Even the way spring training is covered is part of its allure. There’s no 24/7 news channel, no live stream, often not even a TV broadcast. Often, all we get are a few pictures a day of teams and players alike, stretching out under the sun or doing the same ground ball drills we all used to do in Little League. We see players laughing, talking, relaxing, smiling. Baseball players are human, but over a long season, this is sometimes forgotten. During spring training, it’s on full display.</p>
<p class="p2">Now, none of this should be construed as claiming that spring training is preferable to the regular season — it’s not. On the first day ofspring training, everything gets a little bit better; on Opening Day, the world is right once again. Spring training is a lovely prelude, but a prelude is all it is. The regular season is where baseball stands out, where it earns its title as the national pastime. For the truest of baseball fans, the regular season, April through October, is the best time of the year. Then there’s the postseason and spring training; spring training, theoretically, could be as low as third in the baseball importance rankings.</p>
<p class="p2">But either way, the second or third best part of the greatest game in the world? That’s not too shabby.</p>
<p class="p2">Spring training games have already begun, and soon, things start to move.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The days get longer and warmer, the games get more important, and the regular season roster begins to take shape. And before you know it, there’s a week left until Opening Day, and you are agonizing over every minute that passes, counting down the seconds until baseball begins again.</p>
<p class="p2">Well, that’s what I will be doing, anyway. I don’t know about you. But either way, one thing is clear: The long dark winter of our discontent is over. From now through late October, baseball is back, and the world is happy once again.</p>

		<title>Brown routs Columbia, falls to Cornell on seniors’ final weekend</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Heading into the final two games of the season against Columbia Friday and Cornell Saturday, the men’s basketball team looked to honor its departing leaders, co-captains Steven Spieth ’17, JR Hobbie ’17 and Tavon Blackmon ’17 in their final weekend in Brown uniforms.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears (13-17, 4-10 Ivy) took home an impressive 88-68 win against the Lions (11-16, 5-9). But against the Big Red (8-21, 4-10), Bruno had a hard time stopping Cornell’s fast offense and sharpshooting, falling 92-78.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the first half against the Lions Friday, the lead changed hands multiple times — with 9:12 on the clock, the Bears were up 25-22.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But after four three-pointers from Hobbie and Spieth, the Bears pulled away, capping a 26-6 run that put Brown up by 23 going into halftime. Bruno’s 51 points in the first half was its most since a 53-point outburst against Johnson and Wales University Dec. 10.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We played great against Columbia,” Travis Fuller ’19 said. “We played great defense and really shared the ball on offense. Guys were knocking down shots.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Columbia’s offense rallied to cut the lead to just 12 with an emphatic dunk from Rodney Hunter with 10 minutes remaining that steered the momentum in favor of the Lions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears did not let Columbia take control of the lead, going on a 17-5 run which ended on a three-pointer from Corey Daugherty ’19 to give Bruno a 80-56 lead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Columbia was unable to fight back. After CJ Davis made the score 88-68, neither team scored for the game’s remaining three minutes, allowing Brown to take home the win.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saturday, Bruno got off to a poor start, allowing a 19-2 run to start the first half against the Big Red. Brown made several substitutions after falling behind early, but Cornell had built a 41-26 lead with seven minutes remaining in the second quarter. The Bears cut the margin to just nine points going into halftime.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We have to do a better job of being ready to play the full 40 minutes,” said Head Coach Mike Martin ’04. “We had a nice little burst when we made some changes in the lineup to get to single digits, but when you let a team score 92 points, there’s obviously some issues there defensively, and we have got a lot of work to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Big Red surged again to start the second half, building a 70-55 lead in the first 10 minutes. Despite Bruno’s efforts, the team could not close this gap and eventually fell 92-78.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We thought if we could keep the ball out of the paint, that could help us limit their three-point attempts,” Martin said. “They got straight line drives to the rim, they got deep post touches and they got some offensive rebounds that lead to some kick out threes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Still, the three departing captains have surely<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>stamped their legacy in the Brown record books. Spieth is the fifth all-time leading scorer in program history and has started more games in his career than any other Brown player. Hobbie set a new Brown record in career three-pointers, with 257 — good for fifth-most in Ivy League history. Blackmon is seventh all-time in career assists. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As they were subbed out for one last time, Spieth and Hobbie received a standing ovation. Blackmon missed both Friday and Saturday’s games due to injury.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As Martin remarked, the three seniors have been more than just impact players on the court.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Those three seniors have meant so much to me personally,” Martin said. “They have meant so much to our program.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I was happy for our seniors. They had accomplished some great milestones and all had great careers,” Fuller said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown finished the season tied for sixth in the Ivy League, sharing the spot with Cornell and Dartmouth. Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Penn will move on to the inaugural Ivy League Tournament at the Palestra in Philadelphia, competing for a conference title and a spot in the NCAA tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We have made good progress as a program this year in a lot of ways,” Martin said. “We are a lot better today than we were 365 days ago.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">After four straight losses, the women’s basketball team found itself needing to sweep the weekend slate in order to qualify for the inaugural Ivy League Tournament at the Palestra. Two wins later, the Bears are moving on the postseason. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the preseason media poll, Bruno (16-11, 7-7 Ivy) was projected to finish seventh out of eight teams in the Ivy League. Nobody believed in Head Coach Sarah Behn’s team, a squad that consisted of predominantly underclassmen and two juniors.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Expectations were so low that Assistant Coach Tyler Patch vowed to get a tattoo if the team were to make the conference’s postseason.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno entered the final weekend of the season knowing it had to win its final two games to keep its postseason hopes alive.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“These last couple of days, Coach has been emphasizing (that) we just have to refuse to lose at this point,” said captain Megan Reilly ’18. “We are kind of sick of losing right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears took this mantra to heart, convincingly besting Columbia and Cornell in consecutive contests over the weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We knew we still weren’t out of it, so we had to put everything on the floor … we didn’t want to regret anything,” said guard Shayna Mehta ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The action started off in New York City Friday night when Brown faced off against Columbia (13-14, 3-11). After a slow start in the first quarter, the Bears fell behind 21-15.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Bruno burst out in the second quarter, outscoring Columbia 25-8 to take a 40-29 lead heading into the halftime break.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears further extended their lead in the third, nailing four threes while stretching their lead to 21 going into the final stanza.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the Lions outscored Bruno in the final 10 minutes, they would only do so by a margin of four points. The Bears won 76-59 in their most dominant conference win of the season to date.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Much of Bruno’s offense came from the bench. Janie White ’18 led the Bears in scoring with 18 points. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Janie and (Abby O’Keefe ’20) really stepped up,” Reilly said. O’Keefe “had two big threes. She’s always so tough on defense.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Taylor Will ’19 added 14 points of her own, and Mehta notched a double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The following night’s season finale in Ithaca had a postseason berth on the line. Brown entered the game with a 6-7 conference record. Cornell (16-11, 7-7) entered the contest with one more Ivy win than the Bears. Having bested the Big Red earlier in the season, Bruno held the tiebreaker, so the winner of the game would be the fourth seed in the Ivy League Tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In sharp contrast with Brown’s run-and-gun style of play, most of Cornell’s conference games have been marked by low scoring and strong defense. In the Big Red’s previous eight games, Cornell held its opponents to 63 points or less. Cornell has not been the strongest offensive team either — the Big Red posted only 34 points in a loss to league-leading Penn the previous weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Offense comes naturally to us,” Reilly said. “We are number one in the Ivy (League) for most points scored. So if we just run on them, we know that offense will take care of itself … but our main focus tonight is just locking down on defense.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The game started off tight, as the two teams were knotted at 16 after the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Bruno’s emphasis on defense paid off. Holding Cornell to seven points in both the second and third quarters gave Brown a strong 46-30 lead going into the final frame.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mehta was precise all night. Midway through the third quarter, the sophomore had 21 of Brown’s 39 points.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno outscored the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Big Red 21-16 in the final 10 minutes, and the Bears won 67-46. The 21-point win was their largest margin of victory against a conference opponent all season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I don’t know how we pulled out the wins by over 20 points each,” Mehta said. “I think we were just super fired up, and we just knew we had to leave it all on the court.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mehta led the way for the Bears and posted a prolific 28 points and six rebounds. She shot 11-16 from the field and was 4-5 from beyond the arc in the win.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Justine Gaziano ’20 and Will added 13 and 10 points respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mehta said that the team knew its preseason ranking was not representative of its skill. For them, the tournament berth is validation. “It feels good, and it feels like we’ve proved something,” Mehta said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mehta added that the bus ride home was a celebratory one. “We had dance parties on the bus with our coach. We were just on another level.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno will face off against Penn (19-7, 12-1) Friday in the first round of the Ivy League Tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re the underdog,” Mehta said. “We’re also the youngest team in the league — we start all underclassmen, so it’s super fun to show what we do.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the same time, the Bears know they can hang with anybody. “The last time we played (Penn), we lost by three. So they know that we can beat them,” Mehta said. “The game’s up in the air. Any team can win.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the team’s immediate future is uncertain, one thing is for sure: Patch will soon be getting a tattoo of a Brown “B” on either his back or his rib cage. The team will vote on the final design.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s hockey team closed out its season with a pair of losses to Quinnipiac University in the first round of the ECAC playoffs last weekend. Bruno was eliminated from the best-of-three series after falling to the Bobcats Friday and Saturday by tallies of 6-1 and 5-1, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The losses signal the end of a rocky season for the Bears (4-25-2, 3-18-1 ECAC), which entered the postseason as the twelfth seeded-team in the conference.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday night, the Bears were unable to recover from an early deficit against the Bobcats (21-13-2, 13-8-1), the fifth seed in the ECAC. Quinnipiac scored six unanswered goals against goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 before Max Willman ’18 put Bruno on the board in the final six minutes of play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Alex Whelan opened scoring 32 seconds into the first stanza, slotting in a backhanded shot past Nieto off a rebound. Nine minutes later, Landon Smith found the top shelf with a shot past Nieto’s shoulder from the left circle, giving the Bobcats a two-goal advantage entering the middle frame.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tim Clifton scored the only goal of the second period off a pass from Whelan before Thomas Aldworth opened the Bobcats’ three-goal third period with a power play goal at 1:27. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Connor Clifton and K.J. Tiefenwerth each found the back of the net before Willman trimmed the deficit with six minutes remaining. Willman knocked the puck past netminder Andrew Shortridge for his eleventh goal of the season after collecting the rebound off a shot from Charlie Corcoran ’18. Sam Lafferty ’18 also picked up an assist on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nieto made 36 saves before giving way to Connor Maher ’18, who took to the crease with seven minutes left in the third stanza. Maher delivered a four-save performance to keep the score intact as the Bobcats outshot the Bears 46-20 in the contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Quinnipiac’s a team where they shoot from any angle, even if they’re under pressure,” Nieto said. “There were times in the game when they were outshooting us, but we were playing pretty even.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, Bruno was unable to withstand significant offensive pressure from the Bobcats. Lafferty narrowed the deficit to one with a goal in the second period, but Quinnipiac responded with three consecutive goals to secure the win.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Smith notched a goal at 4:41 for the early lead before Tanner MacMaster scored on the power play to lift the Bobcats to a 2-0 advantage entering the second frame.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They came out really strong in the first period of both games,” Nieto said. “They were able to come out and get a lot of shots early and put the pressure on before we were able to kind of get our grips on the situation.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After winning the faceoff, Lafferty angled a shot from Ben Tegtmeyer ’18 toward the net at 15:16 in the second period for his 13th goal of the season. The Bobcats answered less than two minutes later at 17:05 with a goal from Tommy Schutt, doubling the lead. Bruno nearly closed the gap later in the period as Zach Giuttari ’20 had a power play goal waived off for high sticking with 4.3 seconds remaining.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Connor Clifton sent a wrist shot past Nieto six minutes into the final stanza to secure the Bobcats’ lead before Bo Pieper finished the contest with an empty-net goal in the final three minutes of play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nieto posted a career-high 42 saves in the loss, recording 20 saves in the first period alone. The Bobcats outshot Brown 47-25.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following last year’s 5-19-7 (3-13-6) record, the Bears closed out their season with a total of four victories, 25 losses and one tie, including three wins, 20 losses and one draw in conference play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Everyone’s determined to turn this thing around next year,” Nieto said. “We’re all going to do what needs to be done to improve our game and be a top contender in our conference.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Life as a Washington, D.C. sports fan is an exercise in disappointment. Of the cities with at least one team in each of the four major American sports leagues — the NFL, MLB, NHL and NBA — Washington is the only one to not have any team reach the semifinals since 1998. In other words: No team I support has even come within a round of a championship since I was three.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But a recent turn of fortune has put three of the city’s four teams in title contention. After so many disappointments, I just want the same thing as R&amp;B duo K-Ci &amp; JoJo: Tell me it’s real.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The past failings of Washington teams are a poisonous melange of terrible teams and great teams that choked spectacularly. This tragedy is best encapsulated by the team I follow most closely: the Washington Nationals. The national pastime returned to the nation’s capital in 2005 after a 35-year absence when the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington. The team did not win more than half of its games in any of its first seven seasons, bottoming out as the worst team in baseball in both 2008 and 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But those two putrid years yielded a pair of historic first-overall draft picks: Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper. With those two players came success, as the Nationals were the best team in baseball in 2012. That October, they held a 6-0 lead in the decisive game of their first-round playoff series and were a strike away from advancing to the National League Championship Series before blowing a save to lose in the most painful way imaginable.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since then, the Nats have won two more division titles but still have never won a playoff series.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The 2017 baseball season starts in under a month, and the Nationals are in a strong position to contend again. They won their division despite a down year from Harper last year before losing in the first round of the playoffs once again. But the team is primed to be even better this year than in 2016. Prized rookie Trea Turner will have a full season in the majors after taking the league by storm for the second half of last year. General Manager Mike Rizzo loaded his team up this offseason — sending away a trio of prized prospects for outfielder Adam Eaton — with an eye toward a title in the next two years before Harper and All-Star second baseman Daniel Murphy reach free agency.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Washington’s hockey team, the Capitals, have a similar story. Behind three-time MVP Alex Ovechkin, the team has twice had the best record in hockey in the past two seasons only to bomb out of the playoffs early. Nearly 80 percent of the way through this season, they are once again hockey’s best team. The Caps made a splash at the trade deadline, acquiring the best player on the market in defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk. With stars like Ovechkin, center Nicklas Backstrom and young goalie Braden Holtby under contract for the foreseeable future, their success seems sustainable.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Washington Wizards disappointed in the usual way: performing awfully. They won under a third of their total games from 2008 to 2013 before returning to respectability in the past few years. With a new coach this season, their young stars have broken out to put them within reach of the franchise’s best record since the Carter administration. Point guard John Wall has continued his All-Star play, while sharpshooter Bradley Beal has finally stayed healthy and small forward Otto Porter Jr. has emerged as one of the top shooters in the sport. Each of those players is under team control for a while as well, though Porter can become a restricted free agent this offseason.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Any reasonable — or perhaps naive — reader would feel very optimistic about the future of D.C. sports after reading the above. These are three well-run organizations, with a strong balance of current stars and promising youngsters. But any Washington fan will tell you how often a similar story has played out in this city.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Wizards were sure to have quick success when they chose Wall first overall in the 2010 draft, but it has taken seven years for the team to be taken seriously. A championship was imminent for the Capitals when they had hockey’s best record in 2010, but they lost in the first round of the playoffs. The Nationals were primed for a long reign after their first division title in 2012, but they have made the playoffs just twice since then, never once winning a series.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Of course it is irrational but, after being burned so many times, bracing for failure just makes more sense. After all this time, there’s only one thing I want to hear: that it’s finally real.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred and Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre are on a mission to reduce the time of games and to make baseball more “fun.” They have already eliminated the intentional walk for this upcoming season — to save an entire 35 seconds every 2.6 games — and have proposed a frankly ridiculous idea to start with a runner on second base in extra innings (James Shapiro ’19 has written his own thoughts on the matter).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What if baseball officials, instead of destroying a beloved, centuries-old game in one fell swoop, actually decided to improve upon the current game with minor changes that did not drastically affect rules and strategy? Impossible? Not in the slightest. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">First of all, the replay system needs to be overhauled. Replays last season took an average of two minutes and 30 seconds. That’s longer than the standard two minute 25 second commercial break in between innings. The argument that society’s attention span is too short for baseball is overused and inaccurate, but asking a fan to wait two minutes and 30 seconds with nothing but the same replays to watch is asking far too much.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The system is too complicated and unwieldy. Replays are conducted in a review center in New York. The umpires stand around oblivious with headphones on while they wait for a ruling. But most calls in baseball can be determined on the first and second replay showing. There is no need to wait around for people watching a feed across the country. It would be far easier if baseball adopted a protocall similar to basketball, where umpires could watch the replay on the field and come to a decision much more quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Secondly, baseball needs to enforce its pace-of-play rules. <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/09/schapiro-19-official-mlb-lost-mind/">Schapiro</a> disagrees, but only good can come from spending less time watching pitchers stand on the rubber scratching themselves. Baseball has been trying to protect pitchers from their arms for the past decade with no success. Fifty-six pitchers have undergone Tommy John surgery in the past three seasons. It’s time to take the training wheels off.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Manfred has proposed a pitch clock of 20 seconds, meaning that pitchers would have 20 seconds between each pitch. The average pitcher takes 22.6 seconds between each pitch. We already know that at least half of baseball pitchers have no problems with a rate almost that of the pitch clock, so, if people complain, they can be told with assurance that it is not so difficult.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After all, Rule 5.07c of the MLB Baseball rulebook states: “When the bases are unoccupied, the pitcher shall deliver the ball to the batter within 12 seconds after he receives the ball.” Each time the pitcher delays the game by violating this rule, the umpire shall call “Ball.” How often do we see this rule enforced? Never. Baseball purists would send the sports world into chaos if there were ever a pitch clock of 12 seconds. A 20-second pitch clock does not seem so terrible in comparison. It still falls way short of MLB’s actual rule.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A pitch clock of 20 seconds, more than anything else, would speed up those pitchers who take seemingly hours between each pitch. As a Cubs fan, it was pure agony at times to watch the laborious Dodgers bullpen stand on the mound for an entire six-game series. Dodgers reliever Pedro Baez spent 30.2 seconds between pitches during the regular season. In one playoff matchup against Cubs hitter David Ross, Baez spent 111 seconds between pitches after he and Ross both called timeout during the at-bat. That is not fun for anyone.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Batters should not be exempt from pace-of-play rules either. Ross had just as much to do with the 111 seconds of terrible boredom last postseason as Baez. MLB made a rule before the 2015 season that hitters could not step out of the batter’s box after taking a pitch. I believe that pace-of-play rules for hitters could be broached even further with the addition of the pitch clock. Hitters should be ready for a pitch within 12 seconds similar to rule 5.07c for pitchers. Gone are the days of David Ortiz stepping out of the box, tapping his cleats with his bat, unstrapping his batting gloves, spitting into his hands, re-strapping his gloves, tapping the plate with his bat and taking a couple of practice swings.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is no need for baseball officials to start enacting random, ridiculous rules. A runner on second for every extra inning — where does it end? Why not decide games by a coin flip? Or a home run derby type of shootout? Baseball has been played for over 150 years. Drastic changes to fundamental rules are not necessary. If everyone is so concerned with the amount of time games are taking, then why not just shorten the time in between baseball, rather than baseball itself? If game seven of 2020 World Series goes into extra innings and a runner marches out to second at the top of the tenth inning, that is when we will know that baseball is truly doomed.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Heading into its final non-conference game against Villanova Tuesday, the men’s lacrosse team looked to bounce back from consecutive losses and gain momentum before beginning Ivy League play Mar. 18. Despite keeping the game close throughout most of the contest, Bruno (1-3) could not recover after conceding seven goals in the third quarter and fell to the Wildcats 17-15.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We were disappointed with the result against Rutgers,” said Jack Kniffin ’20, who currently ranks second on the team in scoring. “We wanted to come out strong against Villanova and pull out a win.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Villanova (2-4) struck first. Despite the Bears winning the opening face-off, the Wildcats made the most out of a turnover by co-Captain and 2016 All-American Dylan Molloy ’17. Villanova took over possession and scored on its third shot on goal with 12:54 on the clock. The Wildcats then won the ensuing faceoff and again capitalized, with Kurtis Naslonski rifling a shot past Bruno’s first-year goalie, Phil Goss ’20, just 14 seconds later.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Bears fought back in the first period, with two goals apiece from attackmen Steve Hudak ’18 and Luke McCaleb ’20 and another from Michael Panepinto ’19. After this 5-1 run, Bruno took a three-goal lead heading into the end of the first. During the stretch, Molloy also dealt two assists.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the second quarter, Villanova’s attack rallied. Despite Brown winning nine of nine faceoffs, the Wildcats responded with a 5-3 run of their own to tie the game at eight going into halftime. Villanova took 19 shots on goal to the Bears’ nine and only committed two turnovers to the Bears’ six.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We came out pretty well,” Kniffin said. “If we can play the full 60 minutes like we did at the start and end of the game, we will put ourselves in a better position to win some games.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Villanova’s offense continued to roll in the third period. The Bears opened up scoring in the second half after Molloy beat Nick Testa with an unassisted goal. But Villanova answered, tying the game at nine with 11:37 to go before going on a 6-2 run to bring the score to 15-11 heading into the final period.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears struggled to come back from this momentum swing. Jack Curran increased the Wildcats’ lead to five with 12 minutes remaining, a deficit that proved insurmountable for Bruno. With 4:32 left, McCaleb cut into Villanova’s lead with his fifth goal of the game and then assisted midfielder Matt Graham ’17 a minute later for a score. As the clock wound down, the Bears could not overcome the two-goal deficit, as the Wildcats drained the clock with under a minute to go after winning the final faceoff.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We hustled and competed throughout the whole game,” Hudak said, who notched his second career hat trick in the contest. “Our team is going to continue to work hard every day in practice and just focus on continuing to get better each day.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kniffin noted that the team has room for improvement of “fundamentals.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If we can eliminate unnecessary mistakes from our game, we will definitely be in a better position for success,” Kniffin said. “We have a solid break coming up with no games this weekend. We will definitely look at the film and identify weaknesses in our play.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears continue their season Saturday with their first conference game of the year against Harvard. Last year, Brown played the Crimson on two occasions — once in the regular season, an 11-8 victory, and then again in a 13-12 loss in the semi-final of the Ivy League Tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are very excited for Ivy League play to begin,” Hudak said. “We are making strides in the right direction toward becoming the team we know we can be.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">With the season on the line, the women’s basketball team entered the final week of Ivy League play knowing it had to win both of its remaining contests to keep its postseason hopes alive.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears responded to the challenge and beat both Columbia and Cornell by double digits.</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno was powered by Shayna Mehta ’19. The sophomore guard tallied a double-double in the win against the Lions, and then dropped 28 points in the following day’s game against the Big Red. Her performances helped send the Bears to the Ivy League Tournament this weekend in Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="p2">Mehta averaged the fourth-most points per game in the Ivy League during the regular season, notching 15 points per contest. She also swiped the second-most steals and dished out the fifth-most assists in the conference this year.</p>
<p class="p2">For her efforts, Mehta has been selected as The Herald’s athlete of the week.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>The Herald: How did it feel to score 28 points in the final game of the regular season?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Mehta: It was cool to be able to do it then. During the game, I wasn’t even thinking about it. The crowd was so loud —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it was their senior night — I didn’t even know how many points I had because they didn’t have a scoreboard (that displayed individual points) or anything. But it was awesome to be able to come out for my team and get the W.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What’s the team’s attitude going into the tournament?</b></p>
<p class="p2">We’re all super pumped. We know we can beat Penn — it’s hard for a team to beat another team three times in a row. We lost to Penn last time by three … so we’re all so excited. Yesterday during practice, (Athletic Director) Jack Hayes came to our locker room and congratulated us.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Did you always know that basketball was your main sport?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Not always … I used to love soccer but I grew up in a sort of basketball family where my dad was a really big basketball fan and a really big (Golden State) Warriors fan. Just growing up with all that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>… I think I just veered toward basketball.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you model your game after any WNBA or NBA players?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Steph (Curry). That’s why I like to wear his number. He’s an undersized guard. He came into the league very small, and I think people around the league have also said I was small and undersized. But I can shoot, and I think Steph can, too. I think we have similar games — that’s why I like to wear number 30.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you do the Steph warm-up before a game?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I have done it. We don’t do them at practice, but over the summer I would try to do the Steph warm-up.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you have any siblings?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I have a younger sister (Nina Mehta). She plays basketball and she’s actually going to come here when I’m a senior for basketball.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you have a favorite basketball memory?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I think it would be last year when I went 7-7 from three. During the game, I didn’t realize I hadn’t missed a shot, but then after the game everyone was like, ‘Oh my god you didn’t miss a shot.’ And it was a special game because the day after I was getting surgery on my meniscus. It was the first game my dad came to, … so it was fun to do that in front of my dad.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What are the expectations going into the weekend?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I don’t think we have expectations because any of these Ivy games could go any way. We’re just hoping (to) — and we think we can — beat Penn, and then whoever else wins the other (game). I don’t think we could go in with any expectations. We have to go in trying our hardest and knowing that if we put in our all, we easily can win.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After an unexpected fourth-place finish at the Ivy Classic last weekend, the gymnastics team bounced back in two early-week competitions, tying for second place with Yale Sunday before posting a season-high 193.425 Tuesday. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We wanted to go out there, do our best and prove from last week that we could come back,” Caroline Morant ’17 said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown traveled to the University of New Hampshire for Sunday’s tri-meet, where Morant placed third in the all-around, winning the vault and taking third in the floor exercise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After starting on uneven bars, the Bears put last week’s mistakes behind them on the balance beam as all five scores were above 9.600. Regan Butchness ’18 and Jorden Mitchell ’17 notched matching 9.725s. Halfway through the competition, Brown trailed second-place Yale by one-quarter of a point. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno closed that gap on floor —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>going into the final rotation, Brown inched into second place by less than a tenth of a point.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On vault, Morant claimed the event title with a 9.800, going on to place third in the all-around with a 39.075.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What should have been a comeback second-place finish for Brown turned into a tie after a balance beam judge failed to deduct points for a Yale gymnast’s fall, according to several Brown gymnasts. Due to the error, both teams finished with a 193.175.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You can’t control scores. You can’t control judges,” Mitchell said. We “have to do what we can control, which is go out there and do our routines. That was something that was out of our control.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears looked to be back in the driver’s seat Tuesday during a quad meet hosted by Division II foe, University of Bridgeport. Southern Connecticut and Rhode Island College were also in attendance. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Morant followed with another strong performance, placing in the top three in three events and in the all-around.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown began on bars, and Anya Olson ’18 stuck her double back tuck dismount to earn a 9.700 and third place. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After a team pep talk, Bruno attacked beam with a newfound confidence, scoring a season-high 48.800. Morant received a 9.850 to nab second place, and Mitchell scored a solid 9.800 to close out the second rotation. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the competition’s midpoint, it looked as though Bridgeport and Southern Connecticut would claim the top two spots, but the rankings changed swiftly as Brown took the floor. Sky-high tumbling passes and clean split leaps earned Morant a 9.875 and a tie for third. After three events, Brown sat in second with a comfortable lead of more than two points over third-place Southern Connecticut. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A season-high 48.475 on vault guaranteed a second-place finish over Southern Connecticut and Rhode Island College. Morant and Mitchell finished second and third on the event with scores of 9.775 and 9.725, respectively. The pair also tied for third in the all-around with 38.625s. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was so exhilarating to watch all the girls before you go and nail it­ —just knowing that your teammates are there for you,” Mitchell said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears hope to maintain this energy as they compete on the road one last time at Springfield Saturday before hosting the ECAC Championship on March 18.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In a culmination of the Bears’ season long efforts, Brown (16-12, 7-7 Ivy) squared off against Penn in the inaugural Ivy League Tournament at the Palestra Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite a comeback bid by Bruno, the top-seeded Quakers (21-7, 13-1) won 71-60 and moved on to the conference’s inaugural championship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The first quarter saw Bruno fall behind 13-11 after eight minutes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>before the Quakers went on an 11-0 run in the following six minutes to extend the lead to 13.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then, the Bears mounted a run of their own. With spot up threes by Shayna Mehta ’19, Megan Reilly ’18 and Erika Steeves ’19 the Bears outscored the Quakers 21-9 in the final six minutes of the half to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>make the halftime score 33-32.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown led by five early in the third after a layup by Justine Gaziano ’20. But Penn’s Michelle Nwokedi — the Ivy League Player of the Year<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— gave Bruno fits in the low post, finishing the game with 25 points and ten rebounds, and helped Penn reclaim the lead in the third quarter. Nwokedi averaged 15.2 points, 9.4 rebounds and a league-leading 2.9 blocks per game this season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Penn slowly pulled away from Brown and went on to win 71-60.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“On the offensive end, our shots didn’t really fall as they usually do,” Reilly said. “We did go on a run there in the third quarter, but it just kind of wasn’t enough,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears shot 33.8 percent on the night.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The game plan was to make them go left and try to keep them off the three-point line and to rebound better,” said Head Coach Sarah Behn. “We actually did those things. But at the end of the day, they still just had a little more firepower than we did for more minutes than we did.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears put up a good fight, Behn said, and she credited Penn’s strong finish to their maturity and depth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mehta led the Bears with 19 points, while Steeves added 18 points and 12 rebounds.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We have a lot of things to be proud of,” Reilly said. “We won the Ocean State Tournament (and) made it to the Palestra, which were two of our biggest goals.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We definitely grew up — we matured,” she added. “It was a great experience for us getting a feel for postseason action. Now we know what to expect next year when we make it to the Palestra and hopefully make it to the (NCAA’s tournament),” Reilly said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m proud of how the kids worked to improve the chemistry on our team … our foundation is really solid,” Behn said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will find out Monday if they are selected for the Women’s Basketball Invitational, an annual postseason tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The WBI “would be a nice extension to the season and something I really hope happens,” Behn said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Penn and Princeton battled in the Ivy League Tournament’s championship game Sunday. The Quakers emerged victorious by a margin of 57-48 to earn an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Coming off a season-high 193.425 at the University of Bridgeport last Tuesday, the gymnastics team claimed its second victory of the season at a quad meet hosted by Springfield College Saturday. The Bears bested Springfield, Rhode Island College and State University of New York at Cortland with another 193.425.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It gives us a lot of confidence knowing that we can continue to score this high,” said Jorden Mitchell ’17. “By the end of the season, you get into the rhythm of practice and competing. We get in the gym, and we really focus on the fine details. We want to have clean, perfect routines, so that’s what we work for.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mitchell led her team by placing first in the all-around with a season-high 38.875 and winning event titles on vault, beam and floor. Anya Olson ’18 nabbed the bars title to complete Brown’s sweep of the competition’s events. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears began with a strong showing on the balance beam. Mitchell’s 9.775 led the field, followed by second and third place finishes from Regan Butchness ’18 and Julia Green ’19, respectively. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Starting on beam is always nerve-wracking,” Mitchell said. “We had a fall in the middle of the lineup. We always talk about being there for each other, so you have to pick it up if something does happen. We were excited that we didn’t let that one fall get to us, and we finished the rotation strong and ready to take on the rest of the events.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On floor exercise, Mitchell anchored with a season-high 9.850. Green and Anne Christman ’20 posted matching season-high 9.775s to tie for second. Halfway through the meet, Brown led second-place Springfield by more than two points. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mitchell and Green tied season-highs on vault to claim the top two spots with a 9.775 and 9.725, respectively. Going into the final rotation, the Bears had a four-point lead over the rest of the competition. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno collected the top three spots on bars led by Olson’s 9.700. Maggie McAvoy ’18 finished second, and Claire Ryan ’18 tied for third. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After six consecutive away meets, the Bears return home Saturday to host the ECAC Championships for the first time since 2011. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re doing things to get excited and get pumped,” Mitchell said. “Because we had such a good weekend and did so well yesterday, that gives us a lot of confidence and excitement going into championships.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The competition will begin at noon in the Pizzitola Center.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The baseball team has opened its season with six consecutive losses, falling to Nicholls State University March 3 to March 5 and No. 12 Texas A&amp;M University this weekend in a pair of three-game series.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We played extremely well,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles. “Short of getting a number in the win column, it’s been a very, very good first six games for us against two very quality opponents.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears (0-6) fell to Nicholls State (9-6) in their season opener by a tally of 4-1. Catcher Mark Sluys ’18 evened the score at one in the top of the ninth with a single to the left, but Kyle Knauth responded in the bottom of the inning with a walk-off three-run home run to secure the victory for the Colonels.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, Sluys narrowed the deficit to one in the ninth inning with a single, but the Colonels slighted Bruno 4-3. Sluys went 2-for-4 to lead the Bears while designated hitter Josh Huntley ’17 and third baseman Willy Homza ’19 both knocked in runs in the top of the fourth. Starter Reid Anderson ’18 threw six innings, allowing four runs and striking out six before giving way to JJ Sliepka ’19 and Calvin Farris ’20, who each posted scoreless innings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno closed out the series with a 3-1 loss. Sluys went 3-for-3 with a double and scored once. Joey Morales responded with a run in the bottom of the fifth to retake the lead before Chet Niehaus batted in an additional run for Nicholls State in the seventh.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our older guys have been doing what’s expected of them, they’ve been competing, but it really just hasn’t clicked at the end of the game yet — things haven’t really gone our way, we’ve had some tough luck,” said outfielder Rob Henry ’17. “At Nicholls State, we had some pretty bad luck with umpire calls and just the conditions, the weather conditions, the wind was blowing in one day, and a few balls didn’t go our way.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears opened their series against No. 12 Texas A&amp;M (14-3) with a 6-4 loss. Outfielder Garett Delano ’20 led Bruno with three hits, batting in a pair of runs on his first career home run in the top of the fourth that narrowed the deficit to three.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Outfielder Rob Henry ’17 opened the first inning with a leadoff double to the left center before outfielder Sam Grigo ’18 brought him home with a single. The Aggies answered in the bottom of the inning with a solo home run from Logan Foster before adding five runs off starter Christian Taugner ’17 in the second.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After Sluys walked in the top of the fourth, Delano’s home run brought the score to 6-3. Homza contributed a two-out RBI single in the sixth to trim the lead to two. Taugner allowed five earned runs in six stanzas with three strikeouts before Will Tomlinson ’20 and Samuel Hauser ’17 provided relief with consecutive scoreless innings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were either just even with Texas A&amp;M or right ahead in terms of total hits,” Achilles said. “We really played very solid defense.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Saturday’s contest was postponed after eight innings due to heavy rain and was resumed Sunday. The teams entered the final frame tied at two before the Aggies walked off in the bottom of the ninth on a bases-loaded walk. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joel Davis and Braden Shewmake notched a pair of runs in the first inning to give the Aggies an early lead. Huntley opened scoring for the Bears with a solo home run to left field in the top of the fourth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the following stanza, Henry roped a single and later scored on a two-out double from Grigo to even the tally. Henry and first baseman Marc Sredojevic ’17 picked up two hits each in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anderson threw 6.1 innings, allowing two earned runs with seven strikeouts before being relieved by Sliepka, who surrendered one run in the final two frames.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our pitchers faced one of the best offenses in the country this weekend and matched them pitch for pitch,” Achilles said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears closed out the series with a 5-1 loss Sunday. Brown took an early lead on a single by Huntley in the third inning, but the Aggies responded with five unanswered runs to put the game out of reach. Homza paced the Bears with three hits, and Delano notched two hits for a series average of .500.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So far, Bruno has posted a .249 team batting average, with a 4.22 earned run average.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our pitchers have been doing amazing. I don’t know what their ERA is, but they have been throwing strikes,” Henry said. “They haven’t been walking guys, our starters have gone deep into games, our relievers have come in and gotten the job done, and they’ve been getting outs.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both Nicholls State and Texas A&amp;M are two weeks deeper into their seasons than Bruno, which puts the team at a slight disadvantage against non-conference opponents early in the season, Achilles said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s a certain comfort level that you have the more games you play,” Achilles said. “You’re able to get a better feel for your pitching staff and just get more experience throughout the season.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“All and all, we’ve shown that we’re an extremely competitive baseball team, and we can play with some of the best teams in the country,” Achilles added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will open their home slate Wednesday against the College of the Holy Cross. First pitch is scheduled for 3:00 p.m. at the newly renovated Murray Stadium.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Monday, just two days after the women’s basketball team thought its season was ended by Penn in the Ivy League Tournament, the Bears (17-12, 7-7 Ivy) were selected to take part in the annual Women’s Basketball Invitational. The 16-team tournament marks Brown’s second appearance in a national postseason tournament in program history. Bruno opened tournament play against the University of Maryland at Baltimore County (15-15, 10-6 America East) in Baltimore and earned a spot in the second round with an 81-75 win after several unsuccessful comeback bids by the Retrievers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Brown only had two days of practice before having to square off against the unfamiliar foes, it took an early lead in the contest. A steal and precision pass by Megan Reilly ’18 to Justine Gaziano ’20 for a layup stretched the lead to 24-17 — where the first quarter ended.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown held onto the lead throughout the half with superior shooting. The Bears shot 57.1 percent from the field, including 9-19 from three after o</span>ne half.</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno went into halftime leading 43-32.</p>
<p class="p2">Erika Steeves ’19 led the way with 11 points at the half, and Gaziano<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was close behind with 10.</p>
<p class="p2">“We knew that we were playing well on offense — we were shooting the ball pretty well, but we weren’t playing our best defense,” Reilly said.</p>
<p class="p2">As a result of Brown’s defensive lapses, the Retrievers closed the gap in the second half.</p>
<p class="p2">The end of the third quarter was scrappy, with players sliding across the floor or jumping into the stands to save a loose ball. As a result, the Bears spilled a considerable number of turnovers.</p>
<p class="p2">UMBC narrowed the advantage to eight going into the final quarter and cut the lead to 60-58 by scoring on three straight possessions to start the fourth stanza.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Brown grabbed a double-digit advantage again on a three from Shayna Mehta ’19 , the Retrievers continued to come back, knotting the game at 75 with 1:31 to play. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Mehta splashed yet another three-pointer to give Brown a lead that it never relinquished. A few trips to the free-throw line slightly inflated Brown’s advantage, and the Bears snuck away with the 81-75 win.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It got a little too close for comfort there at the end, but Shayna hit a huge three, and … we’re just happy we pulled out the win,” Reilly said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown shot 50 percent from the field as a team and tied a school record with 15 threes. Mehta recorded a double-double with 22 points — fifteen of which came from beyond the arc — and 10 rebounds. Steeves and Gaziano added 22 and 15 points of their own.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will catch a flight to North Carolina Friday to face the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in the second round Sunday. The Spartans defeated CSU 45-37 Thursday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The women’s ski team ended its season Saturday at the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association National Championships, finishing third as a team in the Giant Slalom and taking third place overall in the competition. Leading Brown was veteran racer Natalie Pearl ’17, who took home a ninth place finish in the Giant Slalom with a time of 2:18.51, good for first-team All-American honors in the event.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pearl also added the Bears’ top finish in the Slalom, coming in fifth place with a time of 2:12.99. Pearl was also recognized as a first-team All-American for Slalom. For her leadership on the slopes and performance at nationals, Pearl has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Herald: What was it like leading up to your final collegiate race?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Pearl: I was very excited to be going to Nationals and to see what the team could do, but at the same time it was sad knowing it was going to be my last competitive ski race. The weather this winter has been challenging, so getting any tr<span class="s1">aining we could was key.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Are you happy with your finish?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am thrilled to garner first-team All-American honors and am very happy with my finish. I am so glad that I was able to contribute to the team’s accomplishments. I had a few runs that I am very proud of and a few that I feel I could have pushed harder in, but all in all it was solid skiing and I had two strong finishes for the team.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Can you reflect a little bit on the overall season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This year has been challenging with the transition of coaches. We ran all of our own offseason fitness practices and only hired a coach weeks before our season began. Once we had (Head Coach Alex Norden), things felt much more natural. Additionally, the weather did not provide excellent snow for ski racing this season. That said, we did our best to make every run and training opportunity count, which overall allowed the team to be grateful of every opportunity. By the end of the season, it is safe to say we felt we could ski any snow conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>More generally, how has your career on the ski team been at Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My career on the Brown ski team has been an amazing journey. I consider each teammate that I have had a close friend. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How much of ski racing is mental, and how much is physical?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I won’t say that ski racing doesn’t require a lot of strength, but it is definitely a mental sport. We have one minute to show what we have spent hours upon hours of training on. Being in the zone, and focus are key to a successful race. As far as strength, during our offseason we are unable to ski, therefore we spend our time lifting and exercising so that we are in optimal condition for when our se</span>ason hits.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What are some of your favorite memories from your time skiing on the Brown team?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Nationals my sophomore year was a week I will never forget. It was probably my best performing season, and that nationals had some of the biggest accomplishments and heartbreak of my skiing career. It takes two runs to finish a race, and things can change in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Taking a step back, what got you into skiing?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I love it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is part of the lifestyle where I grew up … I started skiing when I was two, and it was a natural transition into ski racing. It has been my passion for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What do you love about the sport?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I love being outside with the sun shining and the snow sparkling.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>You have a really large graduating class — what does this mean for the remaining members of the team next year?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Next year will be hard after graduating four seniors, but that said, our coach has been extremely active in preparing the team for the transition and seeking qualified applicants to join the team next year.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you have any plans to ski competitively after college?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I am done with competitive racing, but you can be sure to find me on the slopes every chance I get.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Blasberg ’18: Firing Julien sparks flame</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Feb. 7, the Boston Bruins fired Head Coach Claude Julien halfway into his tenth season at the helm. Players and fans were shocked and saddened as the skipper that brought Boston its first Stanley Cup in 39 years packed his bags. Julien emerged a hometown favorite as his arrival lifted the Bruins from nearly two decades of mediocrity. The team won the cup in 2011 and made another run to the Finals in 2012. His arrival brought the Bruins back into relevancy in Boston, but after two consecutive seasons of missing the playoffs and a half season of just over .500 hockey, the Bruins’ front office decided it was time to mix things up. Since hiring Bruce Cassidy as head coach, the Bruins are 12-3-0 and playing exciting, offensive hockey in the hopes of locking down a playoff bid.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The firing caught many players by surprise, but to fans and onlookers, the move did not come out of the blue. His defense-first mantra had become less effective as the Bruins’ best defensemen grew old or left. To accentuate their defensive issues, the Bruins lacked a variety of offensive assets who could put the puck in the net. A typical Bruins game at the end of Julien’s tenure generally featured the Bruins dominating puck time but failing to score, while defensive miscues would lead to fluke goals for the opposing team. The front office got rid of Julien to spark the squad as well as a desire for a different coaching mentality.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Bruins, though, are in good company. Last season, the Pittsburgh Penguins were disappointed with a 15-10-3 start to the season and fired their head coach Mike Johnston. This change was a major catalyst for the Penguins, as they went on to finish with the second most points in the Eastern Conference en route to a Stanley Cup title.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Midseason coaching changes are high-risk, high-reward, but they often cause the affected players to play with more urgency and passion. The Red Sox’ 2015 campaign saw John Farrell miss the last month and a half of the season for chemotherapy treatment. Torey Lovullo stepped in as interim manager, and the team instantly responded, finishing the season with particularly inspired baseball highlighted by its two longest-winning streaks of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Right now, the Bruins are playing with the Penguins’ urgency and the Sox’ emotional grip. The players had an especially close relationship with Julien, and many have stated that he has been in their minds during the second half of the season. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The team’s recent results show a major difference between pre- and post-Julien hockey: offensive production. Since Cassidy took over Feb. 9, the Bruins have netted four or more goals ten times. It took the Bruins four and a half months to do so 14 times under Julien. Both Brad Marchand and David Pastrnak have emerged as serious goal-scoring threats.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Bruins recent winning habits have gone a long way in solidifying its playoff spot. For most of the season, the team was either on the playoff bubble or on the outside looking in. Now, they have a five-point cushion over the Tampa Bay Lightning for the third bid from the Atlantic Division. The nature of hockey makes any playoff series competitive, so if the Bruins enter the playoffs as hot as they are now, they have a good chance of upsetting a higher-seeded team.</span></p>

		<title>Schapiro ’19: The designated hitter is overdue for retirement</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/16/schapiro-19-designated-hitter-overdue-retirement/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is perhaps no subject that divides baseball fans more sharply than the existence of the designated hitter. Since 1973 when the idea was first implemented, it has created a bitter divide between supporters and critics. But while each side of the debate is loud, they are not equally compelling. The DH should never have been introduced, and now that it does exist, it should disappear as quickly as possible — or, at least, should never expand beyond its current existence.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Supporters of the DH have various arguments, which boil down to two main themes: pitcher safety and the flow of the game. The pitcher safety argument says that pitchers should not hit<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— or run the bases — because they traditionally devote little or no practice time to offensive skills, which increases the risk of injury when pitchers attempt to do so. The other argument invokes game movement and excitement: it’s simply not fun, supporters will claim, to watch the pitcher strike out every time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Both arguments come down to the same basic principle: Because pitchers are not good enough — or safe enough, experienced enough, etc. — to hit major league pitching, they should not have to. Pitchers, in short, should not hit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The problem with this argument should be immediately clear. It’s not an argument about pitchers, but one about bad hitters, regardless of position. There is no reason any of the arguments given could not apply equally to a left fielder who hits as poorly as a pitcher. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Take the argument of pitcher safety. Supporters of the DH will argue that it should only apply to pitchers because they face a greater risk of injury than better hitters. This is true, but so what? All players face certain injury risks when they hit; why not let the defenders work on defense, and replace them on offense with players who train exclusively for hitting and running, and thus have smaller risks of injury? If injury risk is accepted as a valid reason to exempt a player from hitting — as it is by DH supporters — it should extend to all players. And clearly, no one wants that to happen.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Other supporters of the DH will claim that pitchers, on average, are by far the worst hitters in baseball. This is undoubtedly true, but it does not solve the problem. Anyone who advocates using the DH is advocating allowing players not to hit because they are not good enough. There is no logical reason that this should be restricted to the worst hitters in the game; indeed, anyone who truly believes in the DH should believe that the same system can be applied to every player in the game. Any argument for the DH carried to its logical conclusion will suggest that no player should be forced to play both offense and defense — a conclusion that is simply ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">All arguments for the DH face the same problem. Any player that plays the field must devote time to learning defense, which means less time to spend becoming a better hitter. Logically speaking, if one supports this argument for the DH, why not have separate players for offense and defense? The defensive players could spend all day doing fielding drills, and the offensive players could spend every waking hour in the batting cages. Better offense, better defense — problems solved! We made the game more exciting and cut down on risk of injury due to inexperience! How could this ever be wrong?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Baseball traditionalists, of course, will recognize immediately why this is wrong: it is not how baseball works. Baseball players must play offense, and they must play defense. That’s the sport. Even supporters of the DH, it seems, would agree almost unanimously that having two separate lineups for offense and defense would be a bad thing. But they can’t make that case with any legitimacy; By supporting the DH, they’re actually contradicting themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Many people are unaware of the history of the DH. It was introduced to help the American League compete with the National League for fans, sponsors and money. While the idea had been debated since the early 1900s, it wasn’t adopted by the American League until 1973, after heavy lobbying from Charlie Finley, eccentric owner of the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Somehow, it’s fitting. Besides the DH, Charlie Finley’s other groundbreaking innovations include gold uniforms, orange baseballs and an air jet that brushed home plate automatically. To increase ticket sales and turn his team into a national spectacle, he gave his players nicknames and had them grow mustaches. In Kansas City, he installed a mechanical rabbit to deliver baseballs to the umpires. Besides all this, throughout nearly his entire tenure as owner of the A’s, Charlie Finley was almost universally reviled. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sure, it’s fun to watch giant, hulking men blast home runs, and less fun to watch a pitcher strike out without having much of a chance. But that’s baseball. You field, and then you hit, whether you can hit or not. The designated hitter should go the way of mechanical rabbits and gold uniforms and become a failed relic of history.</span></p>

		<title>Bruno takes commanding win over Harvard</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heading into its weekend matchup against Harvard Saturday, the men’s lacrosse team looked to snap a three-game losing streak and secure a confidence-building win in its first Ivy League game of the season. Bruno (2-3, 1-0 Ivy) did just that, dominating both ends of the field and earning a 13-8 victory over the Crimson (4-2, 0-1).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The last time these teams faced off, the Crimson took the upper hand, knocking the Bears out of contention for the conference crown in the semifinal of last year’s Ivy League tournament.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This time, the Bears hoped to flip the script.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We focused on the little things every day,” said returning All-American defenseman and co-Captain Alec Tulett ’17. “The team went through rigorous training by a U.S. Marine. This was a useful team bonding and motivational exercise to set the tone for Harvard week.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The week of preparation paid off, with the Bears taking control of the matchup from the opening faceoff. In the first quarter alone, Bruno scored six goals, each coming from a different player. Midfielder Matt Graham ’17 put the Bears on the scoreboard first to tie the game at one. Larken Kemp ’17, Michael Panepinto ’19, Stephen Hudak ’18, Jack Collins ’18 and Dylan Molloy ’17 followed with goals in quick succession to put Brown up 6-2 going into the second quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears’ defense was equally impactful in the opening minutes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our defense came up with some big stops that halted any early Harvard momentum,” Tulett said. “In particular JJ Ntshaykolo ’18 played outstanding, along with Max Gustafson ’18.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tulett added that first-year goalie Phil Goss ’20 — who made four saves in the first quarter alone — also played especially well.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown found continued success in the second quarter, adding four goals. Over this period, Hudak scored twice to complete a hat trick, while Molloy notched his 13th goal of the season. The Bears entered halftime leading 10-4.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We knew what Harvard was capable of and knew we couldn’t take a minute off,” Hudak said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The team maintained an “intense focus” to do “all of the little things right,” despite having a cushion so early on, Hudak added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although the Bears struggled offensively and were unable to find the back of the Crimson net during the third period, Brown’s defense stepped up, holding the Crimson to one goal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the third, Ntshaykolo forced two turnovers and picked up two ground balls to stifle Harvard’s offense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno found its offensive game in the fourth quarter, adding three goals in the period. Tulett — who plays on defense — scored his first goal of the season in his first game returning from injury since a loss to Stony Brook Feb. 25. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Getting to play is always a great privilege and an incredible feeling,” Tulett said. “My teammates were very supportive the last couple weeks and were all excited in welcoming me back, which made a huge difference.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Overall, Goss contributed to the effort with 11 saves, while Ntshaykolo finished with three forced turnovers and five ground balls; Brown’s defense caused 26 turnovers in total. Molloy improved his career goals tally to 170, good for 20th place in the NCAA record book.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This weekend was a good reminder of our potential as a team, and definitely a moral victory coming off of a three-game losing streak,” Tulett said. “There are always areas we can continue to improve upon all over the field. I believe all the pieces are in place for us to succeed as long as we continue to trust our process and systems and put in work everyday.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hudak agreed, adding that the team “took a great step in the right direction.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown will take on another non-conference opponent Tuesday in Holy Cross and will then travel to Princeton Saturday. Brown handled both opponents last year, earning a 20-7 win over the Crusaders and besting Princeton, 19-8. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The baseball team swept Bryant University in a three-game, non-conference series this weekend, topping the Bulldogs by tallies of 4-3 and 5-4 Saturday and 5-3 Sunday.</p>
<p class="p1">After the Strikeout Cancer Classic Tournament at Seton Hall was cancelled, the Bears (3-6) opened their home slate Saturday with a double-header against the Bulldogs (3-13). The contests marked Bruno’s first games in the newly renovated Murray Stadium.</p>
<p class="p1">Saturday morning, Bruno scored two runs in the third inning to take an early lead, before adding two insurance runs in the bottom of the fifth to secure the victory. Outfielder Rob Henry ’17 led the Bears with three hits and one RBI, while third baseman Willy Homza ’19<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>contributed one hit and an RBI.</p>
<p class="p1">“We had a lot of great at bats, just up and down the order,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles.</p>
<p class="p1">Starter Christian Taugner ’17 threw seven innings, allowing two earned runs and posting nine strikeouts, before Calvin Farris ’20 and JJ Sliepka ’19 provided relief with an inning each.</p>
<p class="p1">With Brown leading 2-0 in the bottom of the fifth, shortstop Rich Ciufo ’20 scored on a triple to the right from Henry. Later in the inning, Henry slid home as outfielder Sam Grigo ’18 posted an RBI to widen the lead to four.</p>
<p class="p1">The Bulldogs responded with two runs in the top of the seventh and one in the top of the ninth, but<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sliepka retired Gaby Cruz with two runners on base in the final at-bat of the contest.</p>
<p class="p1">The afternoon’s matchup saw Bruno recover from an early three-run deficit. The teams entered extra innings deadlocked at four, before catcher Josh Huntley ’17 came through a two-out walk-off single to clutch the victory in the bottom of the 11th.</p>
<p class="p1">“It wasn’t pretty, but our guys hung in there,” Achilles said. “We gave them a lot of opportunities to score, but we were able to capitalize when it counted.”</p>
<p class="p1">Brian Ginsberg ’18 paced Bruno with two hits and three RBI’s, followed by Ciufo, who recorded two hits and one RBI.</p>
<p class="p1">The Bulldogs grasped the early lead, scoring three runs in the first two innings, but the Bears responded with four runs in the bottom of the sixth to reclaim the advantage. Ginsberg doubled to the left with the bases loaded — knocking in Farris, outfielder Garett Delano ’20 and first baseman Marc Sredojevic ’17 — before scoring on a single to the left from Ciufo.</p>
<p class="p1">Bryant evened the tally in the top of the seventh when Mickey Gasper crossed home plate on an RBI triple from Tyler Panno. The teams went scoreless for four innings before Huntley’s single secured the victory for Bruno.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s definitely a source of confidence,” Huntley said. “We know that even when we’re down, we can come back when they get ahead early.”</p>
<p class="p1">Starter Reid Anderson ’18 allowed three runs in five innings, before Dante Bosnic ’18, Will Tomlinson ’20, Samuel Hauser ’17 and Bobby Leyman ’19 combined to allow one run over six innings.</p>
<p class="p1">“Our mental toughness was a big thing today,” Achilles said. “It was a collective effort — we just stayed with it and stayed true to play the game instead of the opponent.”</p>
<p class="p1">The following day, Bruno held onto an early lead 5-0 lead to complete the weekend sweep. Grigo notched two hits and one RBI, and Henry posted three RBIs to secure the victory.</p>
<p class="p1">“In the past few weekends, we just haven’t gotten that big hit, and this week we got big hits each day,” Huntley said. “We had all sorts of guys coming through — every game, it was a different guy.”</p>
<p class="p1">Max Ritchie ’17 started on the mound, allowing one earned run in 5.1 innings before Farris, Sliepka and Leyman combined to finish the contest.</p>
<p class="p1">“The past three weeks, the pitchers have done a great job keeping us in games,” Huntley said.</p>
<p class="p1">The series sweep has reinforced Bruno’s optimism looking toward Ivy League conference play beginning in April.</p>
<p class="p1">“We just built on the confidence that we had before when we didn’t have any wins,” Achilles said. “To finally see the product of numbers in the win column other than zero — that’s always a good thing for us.”</p>
<p class="p1">The Bears will return to action Saturday with a double-header against Georgetown. First pitch is scheduled for 11 a.m. at Murray Stadium.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The quarterfinals of the Women’s Basketball Invitational sent Bruno down south to face The University of North Carolina at Greensboro Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After an impressive 14-point comeback by the Spartans (19-14, 7-7 Southern Conference), the Bears (17-13, 7-7 Ivy) fell 87-84, ending their 2017 season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Shayna Mehta ’19 opened the scoring by backing down her defender across the key and kissing an underhand layup off the glass.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">UNCG took an 8-4 lead, but Brown responded with a 10-0 run behind Mehta’s shooting. Still, the Spartans came back and narrowed the first quarter lead to 19-17. Mehta had a hot start with 10 points on 4-6 shooting in the opening stanza.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">UNCG instituted a full court press, but Bruno cut through it with quick passing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They pressed us all game, so we were able to get many layups in the back,” Mehta said. “(Justine Gaziano ’20) was playing (shooting guard), so she stayed near their basket. So once we broke the press, she was wide open,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mehta capped a strong first half by hitting a three and drawing a foul in the Bears’ last possession of the half. She made the free throw to push Bruno’s lead to 49-38 going into the locker room.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears scored a season-high 30 points in the second quarter as Bruno shot 56 percent from the floor in the half.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the Bears stretched the lead to 14 midway through the third quarter, the Spartans came back in the final five minutes, cutting the lead to 63-57 going into the final period.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">UNCG held the momentum and would not let go. The Spartans tied the game at 67 on a three from Bailey Williams, who scored a game-high 27 points — including 15 of the Spartans’ 30 points in the final quarter. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mehta said that the Spartans’ comeback was due in part to the fact that a few Bears were in foul trouble and the players therefore were cautious about fouling out. UNCG took advantage of Bruno’s tentativeness by driving hard to the hoop.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The contest was tied again at 75 with just over three minutes to play. But Williams scored seven points in the final three minutes, and the Spartans converted most of their attempts from the free-throw line.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Two three-pointers from Gaziano and Mehta in the final eight seconds brought the Bears within two, but it was not enough — the Bears fell 87-84.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mehta ended the game with a team-high 24 points and six assists. Gaziano, Erika Steeves ’19 and Janie White ’18, added 16, 15 and 14, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We probably should have won this game,” Mehta said. “We were up the whole game, and then just at the end we weren’t able to finish it off.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“A lot of it’s because everyone is just so tired. We’ve been gone for so long,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The loss marks the end of a record-long 30-game season. The Bears scored a school record 2,169 points on the year. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With every member returning next year, the Bears have reason to be optimistic about their future. For now, the team has a well-deserved break from the action.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the lights of the Pizzitola Center, the gymnastics team battled five visiting teams for the ECAC Championship crown Saturday. A season-high team score of 194.125 put the Bears in third behind conference rivals Yale and Cornell, while the College of William and Mary, Temple University and Penn finished behind Brown in the remaining three spots. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Caroline Morant ’17 was named co-ECAC Gymnast of the Year, winning an individual title on the floor exercise and finishing third on vault and uneven bars. Morant earned first team all-ECAC honors in all three events. Jorden Mitchell ’17 finished fourth in the all-around with a 38.000, collecting second team all-ECAC honors in the all-around, bars and beam.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Coming off a first-rotation bye, Bruno began on floor. Maggie McAvoy ’18 set the stage with a career-high 9.725. Anya Olson ’18 captured third place and was awarded first team accolades by tying her personal best score of 9.800. A 9.875 from Morant helped the Bears achieve a season-high 48.725 in the event.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was super exciting to start off the meet on such a high note,” Morant said. “That energy just kept building.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On vault, Julia Green ’19 tied her personal best with a 9.725 and received second team recognition. Morant posted a 9.750, bringing the Bears into second place behind Yale as they returned to the locker room for another bye. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The team title seemed well within grasp as Bruno returned to the competition floor, scoring a season-high 48.925 on bars. Mitchell and Claire Ryan ’18 set personal bests with a pair of 9.800s. Olson matched the score, and all three garnered second team distinction. Morant finished her final event by scoring 9.850 to tie her season-high. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were all just floating after bars,” Head Coach Sara Carver-Milne said. “It was an incredible effort. (The team’s total score on bars) was very close to our school record. It was the fuel we needed to see that not only were we competing well, but we could win it.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Remaining in second place, Brown was within striking distance of first place Yale going into the final rotation. With five hit routines on beam, the Bears could have sealed the victory. But two falls halted Brown’s run for first place, though two gymnasts were awarded second team honors. Cassidy Jung ’19 notched a career-high 9.825, and Mitchell closed the competition with a 9.775. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They came out and fought all the way through the competition,” Carver-Milne said. “They weren’t going to let anything get in their way of finishing strong this season and qualifying (for) nationals.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown will learn this week whether individual gymnasts qualified for the NCAA Regional Championships. The team could also qualify for the USA Gymnastics Collegiate National Championships.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For Bailey Tills ’16 and Jack Kelly ’16, the five months from April to August are comprised of working two jobs, and they are on the clock seven days a week. Most Fridays during this time, Tills leaves his technology sales job in San Francisco and catches a flight to Denver. On the opposite side of the country, Kelly departs his financial services consulting job in New York City, flying west to the Rocky Mountains.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">They land in Denver and go immediately to a 9 p.m. practice. The following morning, they wake up, have a walkthrough and play a game in front of thousands of fans. The former Brown men’s lacrosse standouts from last year’s semifinal team then fly home Sunday night and get some rest — they have work the next morning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is the life of a Major League Lacrosse player for the Denver Outlaws. After four-year careers at Brown that included a trip to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament in their senior season, Tills and Kelly were reunited at the professional level.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kelly was drafted March 2016 at the start of his senior season. Following the Bears’ semifinal loss to Maryland and the two seniors’ graduation, Tills received a text from Outlaws Assistant General Manager Jon Cohen asking him to join the team. Tills jumped at the opportunity to further his lacrosse career and play with a friend. He was on the practice squad for a week before joining the team for the final eight games of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As a child growing up in Denver, Tills remembers being 12 or 13 years old when the Outlaws became a team. From then on, he knew he wanted to be a professional lacrosse player.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kelly grew up on West Islip, Long Island, a place he describes as “a big lacrosse town.” Having played lacrosse since kindergarten or first grade, he was a serious fan from a young age. “I’d go to the Final Four pretty much every year with all my family and friends,” Kelly said. “Then, when I knew that there was a pro league, I obviously said that’s something I wanted to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When he was drafted, there was no doubt in his mind that he wanted to continue his lacrosse career. “For me, it was an automatic yes. It was something I really wanted to do, and I’m fortunate enough to be able to play,” Kelly said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Both Tills, an attackman, and Kelly, a goalie, had successful careers at Brown, leading the Bears to an Ivy League regular season title in their final year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kelly had an especially illustrious collegiate career. A captain his junior and senior years, Kelly was a two-time first-team All-Ivy selection and a two-time All-New England selection. He was also a United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association first-team All-American his senior year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kelly’s success translated to the professional level, as he was named Rookie of the Year for his efforts in net for the Outlaws — the first goalie to earn the award.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The MLL game is faster paced due to a 60-second shot clock, but that has not fazed either player. Both gave credit<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to former Brown Offensive Coordinator Sean Kirwin’s fast-paced style of play for helping to prepare them for the next level. In the MLL, “the rules are a little bit different,” Tills said. “There’s a two point shot, and there’s a 60 second shot clock, so it’s a lot faster paced than normal college lacrosse. But the fact that we played fast at Brown last year really helped make that transition smooth,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition to the pace of play, the competition is fiercer in the pros. College players “can shoot it really fast, or they can shoot it a little slower and really place the ball. Only really the best guys can do both,” Kelly said. “But everybody in the MLL is that guy. … They were the All-American who can rip the ball and place it in the corners.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Despite the transition, both immediately found success on the Outlaws, featuring on an MLL Championship run last August. “Ending 2016 on a win — on a high note with one of my best friends — was probably … the most memorable part of it all,” Tills said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Denver, the Brown duo gets to play in Sports Authority Field at Mile High Stadium, the home of the Denver Broncos. The team’s Fourth of July game packs the stands, regularly drawing about 30,000 fans. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“To be honest with you, I’d rather play on (Stevenson-Pincince Field) any day of the week,” Tills said. “We had the best fans at Brown.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now, Tills is a fan himself. “I try to watch every game on the Ivy League Network,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While they are flying around the country during the summer months, Kelly and Tills often get to play against some familiar faces and old friends. Brendan Caputo ’16 and John Yozzo-Scapperrota ’16 play for the Charlotte Hounds, Will Gural ’16 plays for the Florida Launch and Kylor Bellistri ’16 plays for the Boston Cannons. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While Major League Lacrosse is far from the most popular professional sport, Kelly and Tills see it growing. “I definitely think if people got to watch it a little more and understood the rules, they’d really fall in love with the fast-paced, high-scoring, (physical game),” Tills said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Tills and Kelly want to be a part of the growth, but keeping a job in the MLL is not as easy as keeping their desk jobs. The fact there are only nine teams, and the admiration that fans have for young players who are fresh out of college, can yield brief careers in the League, Tills said. There is “a pretty high turnover rate in the MLL,” Tills added. “I would love to play as long as I can.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kelly agrees. “At this point in time, I’m going to play until my body gives out,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In less than a month, the two second-year players will trot out onto the mile-high grass for training camp. While they will be wearing orange and black, they are bonded by their time in a Brown uniform.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Bailey’s one of my best friends, so it’s great to go out there and have a familiar face right away,” Kelly said. “Bailey and I shared a lot of cool experiences at Brown for the last four years … just to be able to continue that is really something special.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>NBA players, league can find common ground on rest</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The San Antonio Spurs and Golden State Warriors are the two best teams in the NBA. As one might expect, their nationally broadcasted matchup Mar. 12 was as highly anticipated as any game this season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But it fell far short of expectations. The Spurs were missing their three best players because of injuries, which is unfortunate enough on its own. But the Warriors responded by voluntarily resting three of their own stars in addition to the injury-induced absence of former Most Valuable Player Kevin Durant. Without the league’s best in the spotlight, the game ended up a lackluster competition between no-name bench contributors, disappointing TV viewers who had eagerly awaited it and fans who had paid exorbitant ticket prices to see their favorite players in person.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Resting players has become a hot topic in the NBA recently, culminating in a letter from Commissioner Adam Silver to teams after the Warriors-Spurs game and a similar situation involving the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers. According to media outlets that obtained the text of the memo, Silver described players missing games for rest as “an extremely significant issue for our league.” He also encouraged team owners to be involved in rest decisions and asked them to consider the ramifications of player rest for the league’s TV partners.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The NBA’s position on player rest is an obvious one. When stars miss games they do not have to, they disappoint fans who pay for tickets, and games without stars cut viewership for TV providers who pay a hefty fee to broadcast games. Money is the league’s end-all, be-all, so its stance makes plenty of sense. But with no formal restrictions on rest, teams that sit players are not subject to any punishment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The players are, of course, acting out of self-interest as well. Resting is most common on teams that have made deep playoff runs and hope for another this summer. The Warriors and Spurs fit this description, as do the Cavaliers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Cavaliers played 23 playoff games last season ­— an additional quarter of an NBA season. With older players like 32-year-old LeBron James, the organization needs to ensure that its team can handle a grueling title run. As Cavaliers General Manager David Griffin said to ESPN, “They’re paying me to win a championship. I’m not overly concerned about the perception of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So how can the league and its players reach a mutually agreeable solution? They have already taken one major step with their new collective bargaining agreement. Among many other changes, the new CBA shortens the preseason and adds a week to the regular season schedule, giving players more time to rest. This change is specifically aimed to decrease the number of times when teams have games on back-to-back nights. Those two-game sets are especially hard on players, and both the Warriors and Cavaliers rested their players on the second leg of a back-to-back.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But a few extra days off during the year may not be a sufficient solution. Some have suggested cutting down on the number of games in a season, but that idea is a financial non-starter: fewer games mean less money for everyone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To reduce instances where teams rest players wholesale, the league could introduce a rule that only one player per team may be sat for rest per game. Such a restriction would not prevent players from taking the time they need to get healthy, but it would prevent situations where a team rests all of its stars and effectively throws a game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A more out-of-the-box idea is to reduce the number of teams that make the playoffs. Sixteen of the 30 NBA teams make the playoffs every year, and the title-contending teams are sure to demolish their first round opponents each time. If only six teams made the playoffs in each conference, the league could give the top two teams in each conference a first-round bye. This change would give the top teams time to rest before their postseason matchups and would also increase the importance of regular-season games for contenders. They are willing to rest players when a playoff berth is all but assured; would they feel the same if they were on the cusp of losing that first-round bye?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Player rest in the NBA is a controversial topic, with compelling arguments on both sides. But there is a middle ground to be found, both by changes already made and by more aggressive changes to come. The NBA doesn’t have to sacrifice the health of its players in order to make sure they’re on the court every night.</span></p>

		<title>Cubs primed to repeat World Series victory</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/24/cubs-primed-repeat-world-series-victory/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 2016 MLB season was a once-in-a-lifetime run for the Chicago Cubs and its fans. Putting to rest stories of failure — the billy goat curse and the infamous Steve Bartman intervention — the Cubs won their first World Series since 1908. Down three games to one against the Cleveland Indians, Chicago captured the final three games of the season, capping off the miraculous comeback with a nail-biting Game Seven victory in extra innings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But life goes on — pitchers and catchers reported in February, spring training games began in early March and it’s now time for the beginning of the 2017 season. It is an interesting moment to be a baseball fan. Though the baseball world loves to exult in its current parity and unpredictability, we stand here in the last week of March with only five clear favorites: the Cubs, Indians, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers and Washington Nationals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Comparing each contender against the Cubs, it is clear that the defending champions are baseball’s best team. Washington, for instance, has tremendous talent: Star shortstop Trea Turner and second baseman Daniel Murphy form, perhaps, the best middle infield in the game. If Bryce Harper can shake off an injury-filled slump of a year and Max Scherzer can maintain his form, the Nationals will be in business in the regular season. But the problem for Washington is the postseason. The Nationals have had three tremendous opportunities in recent years to bring home the championship and have not come close, failing to advance out of the division series each season. Can Washington progress further than ever before in the playoffs with role players like Ryan Zimmerman and Jayson Werth rapidly aging, Wilson Ramos making a comeback from ACL surgery and Stephen Strasburg continuing to struggle with his health? It is more than a little doubtful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Indians, meanwhile, missed their best shot at a title last season. Can they surge back after such a heartbreaking end to their season? Cleveland signed slugger Edwin Encarnación, but Encarnación is not exactly Kevin Durant, to put it lightly. Jose Ramírez, Francisco Lindor and Jason Kipnis make for an exciting infield, but that does not guarantee another World Series appearance. The Indians rely heavily on their bullpen, especially stars Andrew Miller and Cody Allen. But, as Yankees fans who watched the Joe Torre managerial era know, relying heavily on certain bullpen arms can cause them to break down quickly. The Indians had Miller throw 19.1 innings last postseason and needed every one of them along the way. They will need their bullpen once again in order to make it back. But they are walking on a tight wire. Last year, when everything broke right for the Indians, they still lost to the Cubs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Dodgers are the favorite according to PECOTA projections and Sports Illustrated. Corey Seager, at the ripe age of 22, is already one of baseball’s best position players, and Clayton Kershaw is the best pitcher in the game. But as terrific as those two are, the Dodgers do not seem to be much, if at all, better than last year. Rich Hill had a career year as a 36-year-old. Confident he can do it again? Adrián González, Andre Ethier and Yasiel Puig, though still at various stages of productivity, have been gradually declining. The Dodgers need Puig to snap out of whatever hitting malaise has come over him and are relying once again on aging players such as González and Chase Utley. Their regular season record might be better with a healthy campaign from Kershaw, but the Dodgers have made the postseason every year since 2013 and have not reached the World Series. Their title window is closing, and they have been favorites every year. What makes this season so much different?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Red Sox are dangerous. After escaping an elbow scare from David Price, they enter the season comfortable and ready, with an absolutely loaded team. They feature possibly baseball’s best string of hitters in their batting lineup: Mookie Betts, Dustin Pedroia, Xander Bogaerts, Hanley Ramírez, Jackie Bradley Jr. and Andrew Benintendi. Boston’s offense is so good it is almost unfair. Add in the offseason trade acquisition of star starting pitcher Chris Sale, and the Sox are a bona fide powerhouse. The only question is whether their pitching can hold up in the playoffs. Unfortunately, it is a gigantic question for this year’s Red Sox. David Price’s career postseason record — two wins, eight losses and a 5.54 ERA — stands out for all the wrong reasons. 2016 American League Cy Young Award winner Rick Porcello has an ugly postseason career as well, with zero wins, three losses and a 5.66 ERA. Meanwhile, Sale has never pitched in the playoffs. If the Red Sox’ pitchers do not step up, it will be another early playoff exit for Boston. The Red Sox’ and Cubs’ offenses may cancel each other out, but the Cubs’ pitching could far outmatch Boston’s come October. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is not much to say about the Cubs that has not been said already. Their offense is ridiculous. Last year’s National League MVP Kris Bryant is only entering his third season and is still getting better, while Anthony Rizzo is a certified all-star. Addison Russell, Kyle Schwarber, Javier Báez and Willson Contreras are all improving young players. The Cubs match their talented offensive youth with pitching experience — Jon Lester, Jake Arrieta and John Lackey are workhorses. Even 27-year-old Kyle Hendricks, the rotation’s youngest member, was a Cy Young candidate last season. Do not forget about World Series MVP Ben Zobrist, either. In addition, the Cubs still have room to improve over last season: Jason Heyward had a terrible year, Arrieta struggled with command issues and Schwarber suffered a torn ACL. Improvement from those three would make the Cubs even more dominant. Chicago is the one team without a discernible weakness. Looking for a World Series pick? Though it has not been said often over the past century, go with the Cubs.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The gymnastics team competed against five visiting teams in the ECAC Championships Saturday at the Pizzitola Center, finishing in third place overall with a season-high team total of 194.125. Co-captain Caroline Morant ’17 posted a series of standout individual performances, earning the floor exercise title and placing third on vault and bars. In a continuation of her successful season, the senior picked up ECAC co-Gymnast of the Year honors and collected All-ECAC honors on floor, vault and bars. This year, she tied the program record on floor with a score of 9.925, and posted an all-around high of 39.175.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since arriving at Brown in 2013, Morant has had an illustrious career. As a first-year in 2014, she earned USAG All-American honors on beam and floor, was named ECAC Rookie of the Year and qualified for the NCAA University Park Regional in the all-around. In 2015, Morant took home the Ivy Classic floor title with a score of 9.875, earning first team All-Ivy Classic honors on floor, vault and bars. Last season, she collected first team USAG All-American laurels in the all-around, vault and bars and earned first team All-ECAC on floor and vault. Morant is the first gymnast from Brown to qualify for the NCAA Regionals since fellow co-captain Jorden Mitchell ’17 and Diana Walters ’16 competed in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For earning ECAC honors and in recognition of her strong leadership of the gymnastics team, Morant has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: What were your expectations going into this season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Morant: I started off the season with an injury — I had surgery on my knee in August, and so really I was just trying to make it through healthy. Knowing that it was my last year, I was really just trying to do what I’ve been doing — stay healthy, make it to the postseason and help the team the last year that I can.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Were you surprised to find out that you had won gymnast of the year?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is one of those things — I knew they usually (award a winner) based on how many people get gymnast of the week over the course of the season, and general performance in that aspect. So I knew that me and the other girl that won it with me, (Lyanda Dudley of Cornell), had been at the top of the ECAC, so I wasn’t certain that I was going to. But I knew I was in the running for it, for sure.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How do you prepare yourself mentally for a meet?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That is something that I’ve definitely struggled with over the years and that’s kind of developed. For me, I think the best thing to do is not overthink anything. In years past, the day before meets I’ve gotten really nervous, and I would go to bed thinking about it at night just going over my routines. But this year, I’ve kind of just let it not hit me until the last minute. I’ve stayed calm, haven’t worried about it, gotten a good night’s sleep and woken up like it’s like any other day. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>You regularly compete in the all-around. Do you have a favorite event?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I really like to compete floor, just because you can’t fall off of it, so it’s a lot better in that regard. But also, that’s the one where you can kind of express yourself more, and kind of have fun with it and connect with the crowd and your teammates while you’re doing your routine.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>When did you initially get into the sport?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I’ve been doing it since I was three. I was actually adopted from China, and my mom said that when they picked me up from the orphanage, they told her that all the older girls would play with me and have me do flips and stuff when I was a baby. They told </span>them to put me in gymnastics because I was a really active child. My mom put me in when I was really young in the mom and daughter classes, and I’ve stuck with it ever since.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Do you have any pre-meet rituals?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I don’t myself, but the whole team — before every meet before we walk out — we do a huddle and we have a series of cheers that we all do, to get us pumped. As a captain, some of us will say things before the huddle, just to get everyone in the mindset, and then we do our cheers and then we go out.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What is your go-to meet day breakfast?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I’ll always go to (Bagel Gourmet) up on Thayer and get ham, egg and cheese on a whole wheat bagel — that’s my meet breakfast.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Several of your teammates also earned ECAC honors.What has the team’s progress been like this season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When we started off, we had a lot of injuries and the season was off to a slow start. We’ve been building, and a lot of individual performances have helped. Like I said, we had a lot of injuries, so some people had to step up, like Anya Olson ’18, … she’s improved immensely, especially because she was injured last year. So seeing her progress from her freshman year to now — she’s helped the team so much this year. And then, specifically at ECACs, Cassidy Jung ’19 — her beam routine was phenomenal. I think she got like 9.825. But watching her train that over the years and have some issues with it in the past — for her to hit under pressure when we’ve already had a couple falls — it was amazing. I was jumping for joy when she hit that routine and it was really exciting to get to see her really come into her own at a really important time.</span></p>

		<title>Ski team places third at USCSA Nationals</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">Two months before the 2017 season, Brown’s skiing team found itself without a head coach. Former Head Coach Michael LeBlanc resigned in November 2016, leaving the team’s seniors to lead preseason conditioning. Current Head Coach Alex Norden was hired in late November but did not begin working with the team until early January, two weeks before the first competition.</p>
<p class="p4">“It wasn’t easy … we had to adjust (to a new coach) right away,” said Ali Gunesch ’17. “(The fall conditioning period) is when everyone gets really comfortable with the coach. We didn’t really have that, so that made it a little bit tougher.”</p>
<p class="p4">That transition did not stop the Bears from continuing to find success on a national level. Brown finished third at the USCSA National Championships after winning the Eastern regional competition. Natalie Pearl ’17 earned First-Team All-American honors in both the giant slalom and slalom, where she finished third overall.</p>
<p class="p4">“Nationals was a solid showing,” Pearl said. “We all skied very strong and solid. Everyone worked hard, and we got it together as a team.”</p>
<p class="p4">Despite being one of the most successful athletic programs at Brown, the team’s varsity status has been hanging in the balance since 2011. Fundraising struggles and safety concerns were cited as reasons for a possible demotion to club level in 2015, The Herald previously reported . But later in the year, Director of Athletics Jack Hayes recommended to President Christina Paxson P’19 that the team should retain its varsity status and set long-term targets for fundraising.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">LeBlanc left the program and relinquished his responsibilities as head coach because of uncertainty facing the team, The Herald previously reported. But after a successful 2017 season, Norden is confident that the program’s varsity status is secure going forward.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“I plan on working really hard to keep this p<span class="s3">rogram at a varsity status,” Norden said. “The administration is very supportive of helping us endow the program, too. There has been talk and uncertainty in the past, but I plan on working really hard (at) not only keeping this program varsity, but also making it thrive and keeping us really competitive.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Norden is fully committed to the team and plans to remain as head coach and is “looking forward to helping bring this program up to financially where it needs to be and keeping the competitiveness going like it has been,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s important people should know that we’re not being complacent about the future of the team,” she added. “We’re working really hard to maintain its varsity status. … We can competitively do better than a third place at nationals. We can compete to win.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though their final season at Brown has come to a close, Gunesch and Pearl plan to continue their support of the program as alums. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our whole graduating senior class is going to donate,” Gunesch said. “I have every intention of continuing to support the team. It’s been one of the most important parts of my Brown experience. I really hope that it continues for future generations of skiers and women at Brown.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heading into its second Ivy League matchup of the season against Princeton Saturday, the men’s lacrosse team looked to capitalize on a valuable respite from classes and take home an important win. But the Bears (4-4, 1-1 Ivy) had trouble responding after the Tigers (6-3, 2-1) took a six-goal lead heading into the second half and eventually fell 21-11.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Princeton scored first, with Gavin McBride beating rookie goalie Phil Goss ’20 less than a minute into the game. But the Bears responded immediately, with veteran midfielder Matt Graham ’17 putting Brown on the scoreboard just thirty seconds later with his fifth goal of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the ensuing minutes, Princeton took back possession and fired multiple shots at Goss, who came up with a pair of saves to keep the game tied at one. But after starting defenseman JJ Ntshaykolo ’18 received a slashing penalty with 11:45 on the clock, Princeton capitalized on the man-up opportunity to take a 2-1 lead.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown answered again as first-year Luke McCaleb ’20 notched goal number 14 of the season. Bruno continued to surge offensively, as midfielder Stephen Hudak ’18 beat Tyler Blaisdell at the net to help the Bears take a 3-2 advantage and swing the momentum back in their favor.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Princeton then ignited a rally, beginning with a goal in the final nine seconds of the first quarter that started a 5-1 run lasting 10 minutes into the second quarter<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to recapture a 7-4 lead.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears’ co-captain and returning first-team All-American Dylan Molloy ’17 cut the Tigers’ lead to four with 9:38 left in the half — his 27th goal of the season. But Princeton’s offense remained relentless, going on a 4-1 run to secure an 11-5 lead heading into halftime.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown got off to a strong start in the second half, with Molloy scoring his second goal two minutes into the third quarter off an assist by last year’s second-team All-American midfielder Larken Kemp ’17. But Princeton laid down a third offensive surge, going on a 5-2 run that helped the Tigers to a 16-8 advantage heading into the fourth quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Princeton opened up the first three minutes of the fourth quarter by scoring three goals in quick succession, taking an 11-goal lead. Later in the quarter, Brian Prigmore ’19 and Jackson Newsome ’19 combined for three goals — each scoring their first tallies of the year — as Bruno attempted to rally back into the contest. But the gap proved insurmountable. As the final buzzer sounded, the game ended in a 21-11 loss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the contest, Brown held a slight advantage in shots, taking 54 to the Tigers’ 53. Face-off specialist Ted Ottens ’17.5 won 21 face-offs on 36 attempts. But the Tigers bested the Bears in ground balls, saves, clears and goals from man-up possessions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the loss, the Bears now sit tied with Harvard for third place in the Ivy League standings. Yale and Princeton hold the first and second spots, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will continue their season this Saturday, hosting the Bulldogs (5-3, 3-0) — who remain undefeated in conference play after a win Saturday against Penn. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last year, Brown secured a 14-12 win over the then-No. 1 Bulldogs. Yale took home the Ivy League tournament crown after Bruno fell to Harvard in the semi-finals last year.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The baseball team opened Ivy League play this weekend with a pair of victories and two losses, sweeping Cornell Saturday by tallies of 8-1 and 7-4 before falling to Princeton Sunday, 3-2 and 11-5. The weekend slate leaves Bruno with a 8-10 record and a .500 Ivy League mark.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 8, Cornell 1</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Saturday, Bruno posted an early lead over the Big Red (10-8, 1-3) in the conference opener. First baseman Marc Sredojevic ’17 led the Bears with three RBIs and two runs, while outfielder Sam Grigo ’18 also notched a pair of hits and two RBIs. Starter Christian Taugner ’17 delivered a strong performance, allowing just one run and three hits in seven innings for his third victory of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">After Brown scored twice in the first, second baseman Brian Ginsberg ’18 added a solo home run to left field in the top of the second to widen the lead. Pierre Le Dorze answered in the bottom of the inning with an RBI single, but Bruno secured the victory with a five-run fourth inning.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In the top of the fourth, shortstop Rich Ciufo ’20 and third baseman Willy Homza ’19 scored off a single from Grigo, before catcher Josh Huntley ’17 drove outfielder Rob Henry ’17 home on a fielder’s choice. Sredojevic hit a home run to right field, sending Huntley home to give the Bears their seven run lead.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 7, Cornell 4</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Saturday afternoon saw the Big Red apply more offensive pressure in a closer contest. But Bruno stole the victory with a solid showing at the plate. Henry led the Bears with three hits, posting a home run and scoring twice, while Huntley notched three RBIs on a pair of hits. Garett Delano ’20 also recorded two RBIs. Starter Reid Anderson ’18 allowed three earned runs with four strikeouts in six innings. Dante Bosnic ’18, Samuel Hauser ’17 and JJ Sliepka ’19 combined for the final three innings in relief. Sliepka denied the Big Red with a scoreless ninth inning, earning his third save of the season. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Delano opened scoring in the top of the first, sending Sredojevic and Grigo home on a single. Tommy Wagner and Cole Rutherford responded with RBIs in the bottom of the inning, but Bruno answered with two runs in the top of the second to reclaim the lead. Homza scored on a fielder’s choice before Huntley drove Ginsberg home on a single up the middle.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Rutherford narrowed the deficit for the Big Red with a home run in the bottom of the sixth, before Ryan Krainz added an RBI in the bottom of the seventh. Henry hit a solo home run in the top of the seventh to maintain the Bears’ two-run lead, while Huntley notched two RBIs in the top of the ninth to secure the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Princeton 3, Brown 2 F/8</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The following day saw the Bears fall to the Tigers (6-14, 2-0) at Clark Field in a close matchup. Bruno siezed an early advantage, but Princeton responded with three unanswered runs to take the victory. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Starter Max Ritchie ’17 limited Princeton to one run with nine strikeouts in six innings but ended with a no-decision on the day.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Sredojevic doubled down the left field line in the top of the first, driving Grigo home for the first runof the contest. In the top of the second, Homza scored off a single from Ginsberg to bring the lead to two.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Asher Lee-Tyson answered in the bottom of the second with a sacrifice fly to center field. Cody Phillips added a run to even the score in the bottom of the seventh on an error, before David Harding scored in extra innings on a walk-off single from Conor Nolan, lifting the Tigers above the Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Princeton 11, Brown 5</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The Bears scored first in the afternoon contest but were unable to maintain the early lead. Grigo and Homza paced Bruno with three hits apiece, while Sredojevic recorded two RBIs off a pair of hits late in the game.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Henry crossed the plate after Huntley grounded into a double play in the top of the first. Princeton responded with three runs, before Huntley singled up the middle in the top of the third, sending Grigo home.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Princeton added four runs in the bottom of the third to secure the advantage, before Jake Rosander ’19 scored off a single from Ginsberg in the top of the fourth. Sredojevic added a home run in the top of the fifth and an RBI single in the top of the seventh to narrow the deficit, but the Tigers answered with four runs in the eighth inning to put the game out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Bobby Leyman ’19, Will Tomlinson ’20 and Cameron Deere ’20 threw two innings each, combining for seven strikeouts in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The Bears will continue conference play with home doubleheaders against Penn Saturday and Columbia Sunday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before spring break, the softball team was riding a five-game win streak, but two losses to Princeton and a defeat at Cornell have brought that stretch to an end. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown (9-16, 1-3 Ivy) opened conference play at Princeton (11-11, 4-0) Saturday. During the first of two games, the Tigers attacked early, scoring three runs in the first inning and one in the second. A solo home run from Kaitlin Okimoto ’20 in the fourth inning appeared to be the start of a late comeback. Annie McGregor ’18 hit another solo home run, making the score 4-2, and Okimoto brought the Bears within one run of the home team in the top of the sixth. Bruno held Princeton at four runs for the remainder of the game but was unable to maintain momentum in the seventh, falling to the Tigers 4-3.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was kind of rough losing it in that close of a game,” Okimoto said. “We really just wanted to come out hard and play for each other and the coaches.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second game of the series was cut short as Princeton scored 10 unanswered runs, resulting in a mercy rule finish in the fifth. The Bears gave up two runs in the first, but held the Tigers scoreless for three and a half innings. In the bottom of the fourth, Princeton brought home eight runners and smothered any chance of a comeback.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next day, Bruno took to Niemand-Robison Field to battle the Big Red (6-9, 1-3). Brown trailed 2-0 after the second inning, but tied the score during the third with a hit from Okimoto and a home run from Raquel Blanchard ’20. Cornell went up by one in the bottom of the fifth, but Cat Seitz’s ’19 solo home run tied the score once again. Okimoto and Julia Schoenewald ’17 followed with RBI singles to make the score 5-3. Despite a late home run from Cornell, the Bears were able to hold onto their lead, claiming their first Ivy win with a 5-4 victory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The final game of the weekend remained scoreless until the sixth when Christina Andrews ’17 knocked a two-run homer into centerfield. Cornell evened the score with two runs late in the seventh, forcing the game into an extra inning. Andrews broke the tie and upped her career home run total to nine with a shot to left-center, but the Big Red responded with two runs in the bottom of the frame to end the game 4-3.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“All of us were hitting really hard,” Seitz said. “We played hard both games. The second one didn’t turn out as we wanted it to, but we played well. We stay together when things are going really well and when things aren’t going our way. If we continue to do that, we’re going to keep getting better.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will take a brief break from Ivy play with a game against Providence College Wednesday before facing off against Columbia in a double-header Friday. All three games will be played at Murray Stadium.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For many students, spring break offers a respite from the dreary Providence winter — a time for the student body to escape to warmer climes. This year’s break gave the women’s lacrosse team a similar, sunny interlude.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears (4-6, 0-3 Ivy) traveled to San Diego for a two-game, sun-soaked road trip against The University of California at Berkeley and San Diego State University. Bruno split the trip, besting Cal (2-9, 0-3 Pac-12) 14-13 and falling to SDSU (8-3, 2-1 Mountain West) 13-8.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The action started Wednesday with a matchup against the Golden Bears. The beginning of the game saw Cal swap the lead with their counterparts. Six goals in seven minutes tied the game at 3-3 before Cal netted five straight to stretch the advantage to 8-3 with just over 11 minutes to play in the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A reactive Brown surge brought the score to 8-6 after a goal from Rachel Vercillo ’20 after a Cal penalty. But both defenses responded in the final 7:52 of the first half to keep the ball out of the net.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The second half was a contentious affair — neither Brown nor Cal would hold more than a two-goal lead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Goals by Hafsa Moinuddin ’19, Carolyn Paletta ’18.5 and Zoe Verni ’19, along with a Cal goal, tied the game at nine.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The next few minutes saw Cal take a 12-11 lead. But two goals in a span of 37 seconds gave Bruno a 13-12 lead. Emma DeGennaro ’20 added another with 3:45 to play. Cal was able to grab one goal back, but that’s all they would get, as Bruno held on to win 14-13.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We went down in the first half a little bit and weren’t playing our best lacrosse,” said Captain Mollie Lane ’17. “But it was just an awesome win that we were able to gut out in the end.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Paletta led the Bears with a career-high six points on five goals and one assist, and Moinuddin added three goals and an assist of her own. Having tallied 21 goals each, the sophomore duo of Paletta and Moinuddin lead Bruno in scoring this season. Vercillo, DeGennaro and Verni each found the back of the net twice in the win.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Just two days later, the Bears took on SDSU at the latter’s home field. In a less competitive affair, the Aztecs recorded the win. Bruno was only able to notch two goals in the first half, while SDSU netted six.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Aztecs converted two goals early in the second half to push the advantage to 8-2. Goals by Bri Irons ’18, Moinuddin, Paletta and DeGennaro would bring the game to 10-6, but Brown would never get closer than the four goal deficit. SDSU outscored Brown 7-6 in the second half to finish off the 13-8 win.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was definitely a challenge for us to have two games within three days,” Lane said. She added that the team struggled with “focus and attention to detail (and) … also being able to play when our bodies were so tired.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With four conference games in the remaining month of their season, the Bears, who have yet to claim an Ivy League victory, are looking to heat up. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We definitely have making the Ivy League Tournament on our radar,” Lane said. “That’s been one of our goals since the beginning of the season.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Next, the Bears head to Ithaca to take on Cornell Saturday before hosting Harvard the following weekend. The next two games are “huge for us,” she said. “Both are very talented teams, so I think it will be a great challenge for us to see … how we can perform against such high-caliber teams.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro ’19: Give Opening Day its due</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A few years ago, Budweiser began promoting a White House petition aimed at making Major League Baseball’s Opening Day a national holiday. After it surpassed the requisite 100,000 signatures a few days before the deadline, it was considered by the Obama White House. I was a signatory, so I received the response from Josh Earnest, deputy press secretary at the time, and — even though he seems like a nice guy on TV — a Royals fan.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“For more than a century, American presidents have celebrated Opening Day — from President William Taft’s 1910 first pitch from the stands to former President Barack Obama toeing the rubber at Nationals Park in 2010,” it read. For a White House Press Secretary, Earnest wrote eloquently on the meaning of baseball and especially Opening Day. It’s a new beginning — a clean slate, any one of the many metaphors that are available.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He went on: “While we are sympathetic to your pitch to make Opening Day a national holiday, it’s a little outside our strike zone: Creating permanent federal holidays is traditionally the purview of Congress,” he wrote. “So, it’s up to the men and women on Capitol Hill to decide whether to swing at this pitch.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Earnest is correct: While a President can use an executive order to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2004/06/who_can_declare_a_holiday.html)">declare</a> a one-time holiday, it takes Congressional approval to create a permanent one. While he’s lived up to his promises to be wildly unpredictable, somehow I don’t see President Trump utilizing executive power to celebrate the national pastime — just this week, he became the first sitting president in 100 years not to throw out a ceremonial first pitch on Opening Day after citing a scheduling conflict. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, if Opening Day is ever to take its rightful place as a national day of celebration, it will fall to Congress to make it happen. At first glance, it probably seems unlikely: After all, Congress, as a body, is not known for its speed and efficiency or for making decisions that make a majority of Americans happy. But right now, the Opening Day holiday may be just what the country needs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Consider it for a moment: Opening Day, the first Monday of every April, as a national holiday. A day of celebration — celebration of Spring, of warm weather and the sun finally showing itself, of new hopes and old friends, of the start of a new season of a very old game. Kids — who the day is really about — could be off from school, free to watch baseball or frolic in the outdoors. Jaded veterans, who work too hard the other 51 weeks of the year, would be given a day to enjoy the spring time and, if they choose to, the ballgame. Family reunions, a barbecue or a picnic at the park, baseball on the radio, spring in the air, nonagenarians grumbling about how the game was better when they were young, which it probably was.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Just look at the history of organized baseball. Professional baseball was first played in 1869, 24 years after the sport’s initial formulation. The first federal holidays were created in 1870. That’s right: Professional baseball is older than the concept of the federal holiday itself. It’s existed for about 61 percent of our nation’s history. It’s older than the Statue of Liberty, “The Star-Spangled Banner” as our official National Anthem and the President’s desk in the Oval Office. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And baseball isn’t just old — it’s storied too. Dizzy and Daffy, Satchel, Jackie and Hank, Home Run Baker, Cookie Lavagetto, the Hondo Hurricane, Bobo Holloman, the Homer in the Gloamin’, Merkle’s Blunder, Tinker to Evers to Chance … we can list iconic moments in baseball history until the cows come home. How about the game played at Hilton Head on Christmas Day 1862, with both teams made up of members of the Union army? Or how about, 149 years later, Mike Piazza’s home <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A3hmASpDqg">run</a> after 9/11? As Josh Earnest correctly notes, U.S. Presidents have been celebrating Opening Day since the early 20th century — and baseball fans have been celebrating Opening Day since just about the first one.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, come on — look at baseball’s history and its inextricable connections with America in the 20th and 21st centuries. It’s as American as apple pie.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Federal holidays mark events of great importance, some practical — Inauguration Day — but mostly symbolic — such as Presidents’ Day or Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Opening Day is both. It’s practical, in that there’s a very tangible reason to give the country a day off: There’s a ballgame to watch. But it’s also deeply meaningful. One need not be a baseball fanatic to appreciate the importance or novelty in taking one day in early spring each year and getting outdoors, enjoying life, spending time with family and friends and celebrating a pastime older than “God Bless America,” 23 states and the Washington Monument.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Undoubtedly, some will say that this is hardly what Congress should concern itself with these days. To them, I say: Doesn’t it seem like the country needs some unification and common ground right now? And how better to find that than baseball?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Not that this should become an urgent legislative priority, of course — spend a few days, whip some votes and see what you can do. I will admit that I’m a complete stranger to the politics of federal holidays, but, at the very least, I’m sure the Freedom Caucus has some kind of objection.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But objections can be worked out. That’s the beauty of baseball. There’s no baseball beef in the world that can’t be solved over a hot dog and a beer, cracker jacks if you’re up to it. And it’s for that same reason that right now, Opening Day is just the holiday we need.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the field of the 2017 NCAA Men’s Lacrosse Tournament takes shape, and eager teams celebrate upon  learning their opponents, the Brown men’s lacrosse team will begin its offseason.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just six days after closing out its regular season with a dominant 20-5 win over Dartmouth, Brown (10-6, 4-2 Ivy) was back in action this weekend in New Haven, Conn. for the Ivy League Tournament.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno entered the tournament as a three seed. The Bears bested Princeton in the semifinal Friday before falling to Yale Sunday in a narrow contest. In the loss — which marked the end of a storied career for Dylan Molloy ’17 and the rest of the senior class — Molloy notched two goals to become Brown’s all-time points leader with 318.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having won four straight to close out the season, the Bears were rolling when they entered Friday afternoon’s contest against second-seeded Princeton (9-6, 4-2).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was a real belief in the room that we could go down there regardless of who we play in the two games and that we could get it done,” said co-Captain midfielder Larken Kemp ’17.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the second half of our season, we got a lot better. Our goal this entire year was to play our best lacrosse in May. So heading into that Princeton game we felt pretty good about the matchup and we felt like we could execute,” he added.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quarter of action saw Princeton go up 4-1, but goals from Michael Panepinto ’19 and Stephen Hudak ’18 cut the lead to one entering the second quarter.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second stanza remained close, as three unassisted goals by the Tigers were answered by tallies from Hudak, Luke McCaleb ’20 and Molloy. Princeton held the 7-6 advantage going into halftime.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tigers looked to be pulling away as the third quarter began, netting three straight goals to take a 10-7 lead. But Bruno clawed back and evened the contest at 10-10 going into the final quarter.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown opened the floodgates in the fourth. The Bears poured in seven goals and took a 17-12 lead with just 2:03 to play.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tigers netted three goals in the final 1:31, but the lead proved insurmountable, as Bruno clinched the 17-15 win.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While Princeton was winning the possession battle and besting the Bears on ground balls and face offs, Brown was able to turn it around by digging in defensively, Kemp said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of credit to our goalie (Phil Goss ’20) and the entire defense for digging deep,” he said. “If we could get our offense the ball, they would put it in the net, so the biggest thing was … we started to win some of those one-on-one battles and get Dylan the ball. And that’s what kind of catalyzed that 7-0 run in the middle of the fourth.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Goss recorded a career-high 20 saves in the win.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hudak led the way for the Bears, recording five goals and an assist. Molloy added four goals and two assists, McCaleb provided two goals and three assists and Panepinto netted three goals in the win.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Molloy also moved into third place all-time in NCAA career goals in the win, passing North Carolina State’s Stan Cockerton with his 194th goal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Saturday of rest split the weekend’s action, and Bruno hit the field again Sunday for the tournament final against top-seeded — and host — Yale.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno carried a five-game win streak and confidence from Friday’s victory into Sunday against a Yale team fatigued from a 4 overtime game Friday night against Penn. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After McCaleb netted a goal just 22 seconds into the contest, Yale scored four straight, but Brown brought the game to 5-3 by the end of the first quarter.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lacrosse is a game of runs,” Kemp said. “And we knew playing at home — they’re a well-coached group — that they’d try and give us an early knockout punch. And we felt like if we could weather that energy … then we’d find a run, and we did.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bears’ final goal of the stanza was tallied by Molloy, who, with the finish, became Bruno’s all-time points leader with 317, passing Darren Lowe ’92.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second quarter was all Bruno. Five goals from five different scorers gave Brown an 8-5 lead and the momentum going into the half.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yale mounted a run of their own in the third quarter, scoring three goals in the final 7:23 and holding Brown scoreless. Going into the fourth, the game was knotted at eight.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Kniffin ’20 tallied a goal less than a minute into the stanza, but Yale answered with about 7:00 remaining and tied the game again at nine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With 3:39 to play, Yale’s Matt Gaudet scored an unassisted goal, his second of the game, to give Yale the one-goal lead.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown threatened to score for the remainder of the game — Molloy sent two shots off the crossbar in the waning moments of the contest, including one in the final five seconds — but Brown was unable to find the tying goal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were really happy with where we were heading into that second half based on our stops we were getting,” Kemp said. “It simply comes down to the fact that we had to try to find a way to protect our goalie (and) protect our face off unit with goals, and unfortunately we couldn’t string them together. (We) hit a few pipes. There’s no excuses, but I’m proud of the guys.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Ivy League Championship, Yale earned an automatic berth to the NCAA Tournament. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">McCaleb, Molloy and Jackson Newsome ’19 paced the Bears’ offense with two goals apiece in the effort.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The loss ended the season for Brown, and the careers of the class of 2017, the second winningest class in the history of Brown men’s lacrosse.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a senior, as a captain, it’s obviously a privilege to play here and to wear the colors, and it’s meant the world to me,” Kemp said. “I’m incredibly proud of the group because I’m not sure I’ve ever been a part of the team that experienced some of the lows that we did, and (we) never gave up on each other. … I’m just really proud of the turnaround, … for us, we felt like we had it the whole time, we just weren’t finding a way to put it together on Saturdays,” he added.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“But from where we came to where we ended — a couple of plays away from having the chance to play next weekend — it’s just been a thrill.”</span>

		<title>Chaiken &#039;19: UNC’s poor example for student-athletes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Collegiate athletics is littered with stories of departments, coaches and teams fighting to gain the upper hand — legally or not. Amidst an impermissible benefits scandal at the University of Southern California, the football team was stripped of its 2004 National Championship and current Buffalo Bills running back Reggie Bush lost the Heisman Trophy he won that year. The University of Michigan’s “Fab Five” basketball team was brought down years after they played when it was revealed that a booster, Ed Martin, had provided over $600,000 in loans to players on the team, including future-NBA All-Star Chris Webber. Michigan then vacated 101 wins over a five-year stretch in response. The University of Louisville’s basketball team, a powerhouse, was enveloped in scandal when it was revealed that a former graduate assistant coach threw parties for players and recruits filled with strippers and even paid them for sex with the players. Louisville has since received four Level I violations from the NCAA.</p>
<p class="p3">As Tar Heel fans rejoice and Duke fans weep after Monday’s National Championship victory over Gonzaga University, the media has made a point to remember a scandal from 2014 involving the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill: an academic cheating scandal in the university’s African and Afro-American Studies department. For over a decade, 200 fraudulent classes were offered by the department. The reports that stemmed from this scandal were shocking. Forty percent of the students in the classes were football and basketball players, some professors never showed up to teach classes, and, in some cases, the only requirement was a final paper. Numerous, dubious independent study programs were offered by the department, and there was even a case where the department chair was listed on the syllabus. He told university investigators he did not teach the class. In a report from former U.S. Justice Department official Kenneth Wainstein, it was alleged that over 3,100 athletes were affected by this scandal, which helped them maintain GPAs above the minimum for eligibility.</p>
<p class="p3">UNC’s internal intentions may never be known, but what is known is that over 3,100 student-athletes were failed by their institution. At top programs across the country, athletes are often regarded with god-like status on campus and in the local community. Many athletes at these programs have never been cut from a team before nor realized they do not have what it takes to succeed at the next level. Yet, in the NBA, the average career-length for a player is six years, as of 2010. The National Football League Players Association estimates the average career-length of a football player is only 3.3 years. Most professional athletes will not make enough money in their careers to retire on — they will need their education.</p>
<p class="p3">But athletes today are raised in a cutthroat collegiate recruiting system that focuses on their current value. A national championship today means much more for the universities than the players, because schools benefit from merchandise sales, television revenue and other windfalls from the publicity, including a boost in applications for the next year. For the select few who achieve lengthy careers and manage their money well, their college years are merely a connection between high school and the pros. Yet, these players are few and far between, considering the vast number of athletes who play at the college-level. The others will have to rely on their college education to succeed in life. Those colleges that offer athletes easy routes to graduation and means for meeting minimum-GPA requirements are failing all those who do not make it in pro athletics. They are not living up to their mission statement; they are missing the mark for the athletes who give these universities so much in return.</p>
<p class="p3">This is not an indictment of UNC’s National Championship-winning team this year, who still answer questions about a scandal many were not involved in. Rather, it is a reminder of a college’s true mission: to educate its students and provide the skills necessary to thrive. Universities and athletic departments must be aware of the stark reality facing many of its college athletes after they graduate. Without the skill to succeed in the professional leagues, these players must rely on their education to contribute to society and have a safe, secure life. Actions like UNC’s send a message that athletes’ educations do not matter to the university, but their accomplishments on the field do. Colleges and athletic departments must find common ground between success for the school today and for the player tomorrow.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">During a spring break road trip to San Diego, the women’s lacrosse team collected an important 14-13 win over University of California at Berkeley. Carolyn Paletta ’18.5 netted a career-high five goals and added an assist to power the Bears (4-6, 0-3 Ivy) to a narrow win.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Paletta, who transferred to Brown from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has found immediate success at Brown. She and Hafsa Moinuddin ’19 lead Bruno in goals with 21 each.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Going into the final month of the season — a period that includes four conference games — Brown is in the hunt for an Ivy League tournament berth, given to the top four teams.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> For her six-point effort against Cal and her early success this season, Paletta has been named The Herald’s athlete of the week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b> Herald: Your six points against Berkeley were a career high, what was that game like for you?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Paletta: That was just a really fun game. They were a fun team to play because they shot so much, and it was really high-paced, so I think we fed off of that. … A lot of girls on my team took a lot of shots that day.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Had you played a game like that before in high school?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> In high school, yeah, a couple of times. But not since (I’ve been in college). Freshman year I didn’t play too much at UNC, and then I took my sophomore year off. So this is almost like freshman year round two for me. But this is the first time this season that I’ve gone on that much of a run.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b> When did you start playing lacrosse?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My entire family plays lacrosse. My dad plays (and played at Cornell) and both of my (younger) sisters play at Cornell. So I basically played my entire life. I was a gymnast for most of my life until eighth grade, so I didn’t really play lacrosse seriously until that point. But it’s a lifelong sport. It’s a family sport.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b> Shouldn’t you be at Cornell right now?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I love Cornell, but I don’t know. I can’t go to school with both of my sisters for four years. And when I stepped on campus at Brown, I felt very comfortable, very at home and I really go off of gut feeling for stuff like this.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b> Are you looking forward to playing your sister this weekend and your sisters in the coming years?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I’m very excited to play against my sisters. Sadly, my sister tore her meniscus — or she thinks that she did — so she’s actually not playing right now, but it’ll be great to see her. My whole family’s coming up, and it’s just going to be a fun rivalry for the next two years. … My dad’s going to wear both (Cornell and Brown gear), but I’m not sure which tailgate we’re going to go to afterwards.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b> Was it competitive between you and your sisters in high school? </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My senior year of high school, all three of us were on the same team. I was a senior, my sister was a junior and my other sister was a freshman. And we actually played a middie line together so that was really fun. But we’re all very competitive with each other, especially me and my middle sister because we’re so close in age — we’re a year apart — so she’s been my main competitor since birth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b> How has the transition been since transferring from UNC?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s been great. It’s been interesting because it’s definitely a very different type of school and it’s also a different program. Coming from a championship program to an Ivy League program has been a completely different experience but equally as intense.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b> So how’s that culture been different to the culture here at Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It takes a lot more self-motivation, but … that’s one of the big differences, (at Brown) we really play for each other, and it’s more of wanting to be the best for your teammates and wanting to be the best for your school. At UNC you want to be the best to be the best. Here, we know where we’re at in terms of the national level, but we all strive every single day to be the best that each of us can be individually for our team.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b> What do you like most about Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The quality of the people. I think everyone at this school is so self-motivated and does a million things. Everyone on my team — we’re all athletes, but at the same time everyone’s got a hundred other things going on, and it’s just so impressive to see how everyone balances their school, their sports and their extracurricular activities.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b> What do you think is the strongest part of your game?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My speed. That’s one thing that no matter how I show up on a given day, I know that I’ll be the fastest girl on the field. So I lean on that for days that I’m having poorer stick skills or I get in my head. I know I can beat a girl to a ground ball, I can beat her down the field.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Brown softball team dropped a midweek contest to crosstown rival Providence College Wednesday, falling to the Friars 10-0 in five innings.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown (9-17, 1-3 Ivy) surrendered seven runs in the top of the second, as Providence (10-18) rattled off five hits, including back-to-back triples with two outs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starter Emily Waters ’20 took the loss for Bruno and was relieved by Megan Wimmer ’19 in the second inning. Gina Chieffallo ’17 threw 2.1 innings of scoreless relief to close out the game. Christina Ramirez earned the win for the Friars, striking out five Bears over the full five innings.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown loaded the bases in the first inning with no outs after two walks and a single but failed to do any damage against Ramirez. Bruno totaled just five hits to Providence’s 12. Second baseman Christina Andrews ’17 led with two hits to bring her batting average to .316 on the season. Shortstop Katilin Okimoto ’20 added a single, extending her hitting streak to eight games.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will turn their attention back to conference play this weekend, welcoming Columbia and Penn in the first Ivy League games at Brown’s newly renovated turf facility.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The two doubleheaders present an opportunity for Bruno to gain separation against North-conference foes Harvard and Dartmouth, who both started conference play 1-3.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Trying to come out and get some wins this weekend will really help,” said pitcher Katie Orona ’18. The Bears are “just trying to stay even with them in terms of record, because (those teams) are the ones that really matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno has enjoyed success against the Quakers in past seasons, winning three of the four past contests dating back to 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The teams have historically been evenly matched, Orona said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While Head Coach Katie Flynn has not announced the starting pitchers for this weekend’s games, Orona got the starting nod twice in Brown’s opening Ivy League games, earning the win against Cornell Apr. 2.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Should Orona get another start this weekend, pitch control will be key.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Her most important tactic? “Just throw a lot of strikes,” she said. “They swing a lot, historically, so just going out there and making sure I don’t give them any free passes.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">After a difficult loss at Princeton last week, the men’s lacrosse team hosted Penn Saturday, hoping to build momentum toward the second half of conference play. The Bears (5-4, 2-1 Ivy) did just that, overcoming an early 5-1 deficit to take an 11-8 victory over the Quakers (4-5, 1-3). First-year goalie Phil Goss ’20 was a standout in the win, notching a career-high 19 saves. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We had a great week of practice with high intensity,” said veteran midfielder Steve Hudak ’18. “It definitely translated into the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Penn started off the scoring, with Jack Ulrich finding the back of the net with 5:02 left in the first quarter. Brown took over possession, but could not respond despite five shot attempts. With four seconds remaining, Penn notched another goal to take a 2-0 lead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Less than a minute into the second quarter, Jake Miller ’18 put the Bears on the scoreboard, capitalizing on a rare goal-scoring opportunity as a defenseman.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Penn responded with an offensive surge. Just 10 seconds later, the Quakers scored to take back the momentum and bring the score to 3-1. Over the next three minutes, Penn notched two more goals, capping a 3-0 run and taking a 5-1 lead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We know what we’re capable of and how quickly we can score goals,” Hudak said. “So we stayed poised and collected and made little plays to get out of that hole.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears regrouped after team co-captain Dylan Molloy ’17 scored two goals in under a minute — his 26th and 27th of the season — to swing the momentum back in Bruno’s favor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then, midfielder Michael Panepinto ’19 found the back of the net off an assist from veteran Matt Graham ’17 to cut Penn’s lead to one at 5-4.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears continued to roll as the second quarter came to a close. Rookie attackman Luke McCaleb ’20, midfielder Ted Ottens ’17.5 and Panepinto all scored over the next four minutes to cap a 6-0 run and give the Bears a 7-5 lead going into halftime.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There was good energy at halftime,” Hudak said. “We knew what we needed to do to finish the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Quakers rallied back, with goals at 13:14 and 11:47 in the third stanza to tie the game at seven. But Brown did not back down. With 5:58 remaining, attackman Jackson Newsome ’19 found the back of the net off an assist from Graham to put Bruno back on top, 8-7. Brown continued its offensive surge, scoring two more to take a 10-7 lead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the fourth quarter, the teams exchanged blows. The Bears started off the quarter with another goal by Newsome — his fourth of the season — at 10:09 to cap a 4-0 run. The Quakers responded with a goal at 1:09, but it was too late. The Bears held the 11-8 lead as the clock dwindled to secure the win.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was a huge win,” Hudak said. “Any Ivy win is great.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ottens secured a game-high eight ground balls and won 16 of 23 face-offs for the Bears. Overall, Brown<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>held advantages in shots, ground balls and clears, while committing fewer turnovers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Phil had a great week of practice and his hard work paid off in the game,” Hudak said. “He really stood on his head.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With the win, Brown improves to 2-1 in conference play. The Bears also move into a tie with Princeton for second place in the Ivy League standings. Yale, who remains undefeated in conference games, holds the number one spot.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno will continue its season with a pivotal matchup against the Bulldogs (7-3, 4-0) in New Haven Saturday. With a win against Yale — the reigning conference champions — the Bears would take over the top spot in the Ivy League. Last year, the Bears topped the No.1 ranked Bulldogs 14-12 at home.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We need another great week of practice,” Hudak said. “Doing the little things right will lead to success.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">After narrowly missing out on a victory at the ECAC Championships March 18, the gymnastics team traveled to Seattle Pacific University to compete in the USA Gymnastics Collegiate National Championships for the fifth consecutive year. The team finished as one of the top eight teams in its region and therefore qualified for the competition. The Bears began competition Friday night during the second preliminary session but did not advance to the team final competition, finishing outside the top two with a score of 192.225. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The fifth place preliminary finish concluded the Bears’ season as a team, but Anya Olson ’18 qualified to Sunday’s individual event finals on the uneven bars, where she finished tied for second and earned her first career First Team USAG All-American honors. Jorden Mitchell ’17 earned a spot in the vault and balance beam finals but was not able to compete due to injury. Mitchell also tallied a 38.825 to place fifth overall in the all-around competition, earning first-team honors. She finished her tenure at Brown with six USAG All-American honors, including three in the all-around.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears opened preliminary competition on vault, where Julia Green ’19 scored 9.725 to tie a personal best. Mitchell anchored the rotation by matching her season-high 9.775 and finishing seventh overall. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A second-rotation bye resulted in a brief break from competition before Bruno took to the uneven bars. Claire Ryan ’18 notched a 9.750, and Olson logged a 9.775. Caroline Morant ’17 made her only appearance of the night on bars and matched Ryan’s score to conclude her Brown gymnastics career. Morant previously qualified for the NCAA Regional Championships last weekend but was scratched due to injury.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Halfway through (the competition), we were pleased and ready to go on to beam,” Mitchell said. “Everyone’s attitude the whole time was good, and we were all having fun.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno looked poised to nab a berth in the team finals after two events, but four falls on balance beam took a toll on the team score. Ryan posted a 9.675 to tie a season-high, and Mitchell scored 9.775, tying for third overall. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The meet’s not over until it’s over,” Mitchell said. “Anything can happen, so we put it behind us. We went out there, had fun and showed off on floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown finished strong on floor exercise as Maggie McAvoy ’18 opened the final rotation with a personal best 9.750. Olson and Anne Christman ’20 followed with a pair of 9.700s, and Brooke Williams ’17 scored a 9.625 in her first performance of the season. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“At the end of the meet, all the seniors did a huddle, and we all started crying,” Mitchell said. “The seniors will definitely miss it, but we couldn’t be prouder of our team.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The baseball team continued conference play this weekend, splitting a doubleheader against Penn Saturday by scores of 4-2 and 8-6 before falling to Columbia Sunday 3-1 and 9-5. With the 1-3 weekend, the Bears move to 9-13 (3-5 Ivy) on the season.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 2, Penn 4</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Saturday, the Bears were unable to maintain an early lead in the opening contest against the Quakers (14-13, 4-4). Outfielder Sam Grigo ’18 and catcher Josh Huntley ’17 led the Bears with one RBI each, while outfielder Rob Henry ’17 recorded a pair of hits in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">After Brown took an early 1-0 lead, Matt O’Neill and Daniel Halevy responded with back-to-back home runs in the top of the second for the Quakers. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Matt McGeagh added a solo home run in the top of the fourth, before Huntley drove Grigo home with an RBI double to narrow the deficit in the bottom of the sixth. But Halevy answered with Penn’s fourth home run of the contest in the top of the seventh to put the game out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Starter Christian Taugner ’17 took his second loss of the season, allowing four runs with five strikeouts in seven innings.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 8, Penn 6</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The afternoon’s contest saw Bruno recover from an early five-run deficit, scoring eight consecutive runs — including four in the bottom of the seventh — to claim the victory. Huntley and outfielder Garett Delano ’20 paced the Bears with two hits apiece, while designated hitter Cameron Deere ’20 scored three runs.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The Quakers opened scoring with five runs over the first two innings, but Bruno answered with two runs in the bottom of the third and runs in the fifth and sixth to shorten the deficit. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Henry led off the bottom of the seventh with a solo home run, tying the score at five. Huntley scored off a bases-loaded single from Delano to reclaim the lead, before third baseman Willy Homza ’19 and first baseman Marc Sredojevic ’17 crossed the plate on a single up the middle from Deere.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Peter Matt answered with a solo home run in the top of the eighth, but the Bears denied the Quakers in the ninth to secure the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“It was kind of a death by paper cut — just score one, score two, score one and then put up a big inning,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles. “That was the difference in the ballgame.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Starter Reid Anderson ’18 threw five innings, allowing five runs with eight strikeouts. Will Tomlinson ’20, Samuel Hauser ’17, JJ Sliepka ’19 and Dante Bosnic ’18 combined to allow one run in the final four innings.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“To come out … with a split the way we played — I was really proud of our guys,” Achilles said. “We have great leadership within the team, and the guys understand that the game’s not over until the last hour.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“I was really proud of us,” Grigo said. “We came back and we really rallied.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 1, Columbia 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The following day saw Bruno fall to the Lions (7-15, 3-2) in a close matchup. Grigo led the Bears with three hits, while Sredojevic notched a pair of hits and one RBI.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">With the game tied at one, Julian Bury and Joe Engel crossed the plate on a bases-loaded single from Randell Kanamaru in the top of the seventh, putting the game out of reach for the Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Starter Max Ritchie ’17 limited the Lions to one run with four strikeouts in 6.2 innings. Bosnic finished the final inning in relief, allowing two runs.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 5, Columbia 9</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In the afternoon contest, the Bears were unable to generate enough offensive pressure to match the Lions. Grigo lead the Bears with four hits, while Sredojevic notched two RBIs.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The game went back and forth early, as an RBI double from Deere in the bottom of the fourth evened the tally at three.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">But Columbia responded with four consecutive runs<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— including a 2-RBI home run from McGill — to reclaim the lead.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Delano sent Homza home on a single in the bottom of the sixth, but Joe Engel and Kanemaru each added RBIs in the final two innings to secure the victory. Brown scored a run in the bottom of the ninth and had the bases loaded, but could not mount a late comeback effort.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Dropping both today is disappointing,” Grigo said. “We just dug ourselves too big a hole to come out from in one inning.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“You can’t be down that many runs in the last inning and expect to score five or six,” Grigo added.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Starter Bobby Leyman ’19 allowed five runs with two strikeouts in four innings. Calvin Farris ’20, Will Tomlinson ’20 and Hauser combined to finish the contest in relief, allowing four runs in five innings.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The Bears will return to action Tuesday with a visit to the University of Rhode Island, before continuing conference play next weekend with a four-game series at Dartmouth. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">With five games remaining, the women’s lacrosse team had failed to record an Ivy League win. They had a chance to do so Saturday against league-leading Cornell, a squad that has not lost since a one-goal defeat to Pennsylvania State University Feb. 25.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After an initial deficit and a hard-fought second half, the Bears (4-7, 0-4 Ivy) fell to Cornell (9-1, 4-0 Ivy) in an 11-8 bout.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was a great game,” said Carolyn Paletta ’18.5, whose sister plays for the Big Red but was injured for Saturday’s game. “We had a lot of momentum that we’d been lacking in the past couple of weeks. … Overall, just the enthusiasm and the intensity was really high. A lot of people didn’t expect us to win this game — and we didn’t — but … I don’t think (the score) reflects the way that we played.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Big Red came out fast and netted a goal just 1:03 into the game. Then, just 14 seconds later, Cornell found the back of the net again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The opposition stretched the lead to 4-1 before Bruno brought the game to 5-3 at the half.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In its past two losses, Brown has fallen into early deficits. “It’s definitely a problem that we’ve had all season,” Paletta said. “I think we tend to just take a little time to get our heads in the game and get comfortable with our sticks and get comfortable with each other. … Especially offensively, adapting to the structure of the other team’s defense, I think it takes us a little while to figure them out.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hafsa Moinuddin ’19 finished an early second half goal to bring the game within one. But the next nine minutes saw Cornell score four unanswered goals to make the score 9-4.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno outscored the Big Red 4-2 in the final 17:38, but the lead proved to be too much for the Bears. Two saves by Cornell’s Renee Poullott and a free position shot and goal by Catherine Ellis — her fourth of the game — iced the win for Cornell.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Paletta led the way for the Bears with three goals. The junior midfielder is on a hot streak as of late, scoring nine goals in the last three games and finding the back of the net in all but one game this year. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’ve been feeling pretty good. My stick work’s been good and I really think our offense is starting to figure each other out more,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cornell picked up 21 ground balls to Brown’s 11, and Maggie Bigelow ’20 recorded nine saves in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown sits last in the Ivy League, but the Bears are remaining positive for the rest of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re really focused on belief,” Paletta said. “(It’s) our main mantra right now. We’re not officially out of the Ivy League Tournament, and we just need to play our absolute best in all of the next coming games and just believe that we are the stronger team, because we know that we have the potential and we know that we can beat these teams.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will look to grab their first Ivy League win against Harvard (6-5, 3-1 Ivy) Saturday at Stevenson-Pincince Field.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Three thousand miles apart, the men’s and women’s crew teams took to the water this weekend to compete in Cambridge, Mass. and Sacramento, Calif., respectively. Challenged by rough conditions, the men’s crew team competed early Saturday morning against Harvard for the Stein Cup. The annual 2,000-meter race between the Ivy League rivals was held on the Charles River. Each school sent five boats to compete in separate races. Though the Bears won three of the five events, the Crimson took home the cup after winning the deciding varsity race. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the water, the teams faced a challenging headwind. “Conditions were pretty wild to say the least,” said Peter Woolley ’17, who competed in the junior varsity boat. Woolley added that the strong wind can exacerbate mistakes. “If you make a single error, the headwind can throw the boat completely off course,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The conditions made the races very slow and technically difficult,” said Daniel Meyer ’17.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Going into the race, the team knew it would be challenging and competitive. Harvard is Bruno’s biggest rival, and this is the biggest race of the year, Meyer said. Moreover, Harvard’s junior varsity team was the defending National Champion, adding another level of competition.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Although the varsity boat lost, junior varsity snuck by the Crimson boat to win an exhilarating race. Coming from a boat length behind at the halfway mark, the Bruno’s boat overcame the deficit to win by just under a second. The conditions made it “easy to lose your head,” Woolley said. “But we had five seniors who brought a very high level of maturity to the race.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team saw the race as a building block for its future goals. “We know Harvard is fast, so competing well with them is a great sign for our program,” Meyer said. “We see each race as building towards the Ivy Championship and finding the fastest combination of guys for each boat.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“A number of seniors were in the Harvard (junior varsity) boat as well,” Woolley said. “We have been racing them for four years now, so it was fun to see them again and cap it off with a win.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the other side of the country, the women’s team competed in the Lake Natoma Invitational. Hosted by the Sacramento State Aquatics Center, the event featured nine teams from across the country. In addition to Brown, competitors included University of California at Berkeley and Stanford University. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was a great chance to see how we stack up against the California schools,” said Captain Monika Sobieszek ’17. West Coast schools are able to row on the water year round, giving them an advantage over East Coast schools forced inside by the winter, she said. The competition is “a great chance to see how we are doing at this point in the season,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Although Brown won all its races on the first day of competition, the second day saw more varied results. The second varsity and fourth varsity boats came in second while the main boat placed third in its races. Cal and Stanford, ranked second and sixth in the nation respectively, gave Bruno some very challenging competition, according to Sobieszek. But “second varsity and fourth varsity both beat Stanford, which is pretty incredible,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking forward, the men’s team faces Northeastern University and the women’s team will race against Cornell next Saturday at home on the Seekonk River in Providence. “Racing on the Seekonk is very different from racing out here in California,” Sobieszek said. “The conditions are always different and can be difficult. It will be fun coming back to Providence and racing at home in the challenging conditions.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"> The men’s lacrosse team continued conference play last weekend with a matchup against Penn Saturday at Stevenson-Pincince Field. Coming off a tough loss to Princeton the week prior, the Bears (5-4, 2-1 Ivy) hoped to secure a pivotal win to get the season back on track. But with 11:24 left in the second quarter, Bruno trailed 5-1.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Facing a four-goal deficit, the Bears’ defense rallied, led by a 19-save effort by first-year goalie Phil Goss ’20. Down the stretch, with the help of a strong defensive front, Goss allowed just three goals on 18 shots to help Brown mount a comeback in the 11-8 win.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> For his significant impact on the Bears’ come-from-behind victory, Goss has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: You had a career-high in saves in the win. What does that mean to you?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Goss: It’s a nice stat line on paper, but you really have to credit the defense. They did an incredible job of stopping guys — just allowing low angle shots. Penn took 41 shots but not many quality ones. The defense did a great job of keeping them out of the middle and down the alleys, and giving me shots that any goalie could stop.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Can you talk a little about the Penn game and Brown’s comeback?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I just try to focus on what’s going on right there immediately in front of me. The leaders out there are keeping everyone calm. We were just focused on keeping our cool and taking it one play at a time, getting back on top and doing the little things in hopes that they would compound and get us where we should be.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What’s it like starting as just a freshman?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Honestly, it’s a tough transition going from high school to college. The play is so much faster and the guys are so much more talented. But the older guys on the team have really been patient with me, helping out to the best of their abilities. There’s definitely some great leadership on the team.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How much of playing goalie is a mental challenge?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s definitely a huge component. I’ve worked a lot the past two or three years on that part of the game. As a goalie, you kind of have to forget about the swings and just tame your mental voice and focus on the task at hand. You really have to lock in. The defense has been an incredible part of it, and the coaches have been great all year. I really appreciate the team helping me get into a mental state where I can just focus on stopping the ball when I see a shot and not having to think about the next play or the next game or anything like that.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What’s the dynamic been like with a new coaching staff this year?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I’m incredibly happy with the coaching staff. I couldn’t have picked a better head coach or assistant coaches. It’s a really experienced, really well-rounded group. Coach (Mike) Daly is a legend and has achieved so much in his career. I couldn’t be happier about the guys that I’m playing for, and I think program-wide we’re all really impressed with what the coaches bring each and every day — their attention to detail and intensity. I have so much confidence with them, and hopefully we’ll see success.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What are some of the expectations like for the Yale game this weekend?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There’s definitely a tradition of the Brown-Yale rivalry, but we don’t really, as a team, try to think too much about the past or the future. The big hype behind the game for us is that we control our own destiny at this point. So, for us, it’s just one game at a time, one play at a time. We are locked in on this one game, because if we can take care of business, then we control our destiny. That’s what it comes down to for us.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>More generally, what are some goals for the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Coming into the season everyone has the goal of making the Ivy League Tournament, making the NCAA Tournament and winning the national championship. For us, those are all achievable goals. We know if we work hard and focus and take care of business, we can achieve all of those, and that’s the plan. It’s always been the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Taking a step back, when did you start playing lacrosse?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I started playing lacrosse in kindergarten, but I kind of hated it so I quit. I started playing again in third grade, fell in love with it, and have been playing ever since.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Why did you decide to come to Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When I toured the campus, I just fell in love with the community and the school spirit. At a lot of other schools, I saw a lot of people walking around, not really interested in what other people were up to. At Brown, everyone cares about how you are doing or what is going on in the room next door. I just loved the sense of the community that the school had to offer.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of every NBA season, the inevitable discussion surrounding the tactic of “tanking” emerges. For those who are unaware, NBA teams with no hope of reaching the playoffs “tank” — lose games on purpose — in order to secure a better position in the NBA draft lottery. The flawed lottery system, in which the worse a team’s record is, the higher its chance of getting a top pick, creates this phenomenon. The team with the worst record in the league has a 25 percent chance of getting the number one pick, the second worst team has a 19.9 percent chance, the third worst team has a 15.6 percent chance and so on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem with this system is that once a team knows they have no hope of reaching the playoffs, they will begin to tank. Tanking does not mean players playing badly and losing on purpose. Jobs are on the line and players have too much pride and incentive. Teams will rest their better players or hold them out with “injuries,” and bench players will get more playing time so the team’s performance will suffer. For example, the Lakers shut down Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng on March 15 for the rest of the season, even though both players have massive contracts. The Phoenix Suns, in their Tuesday night game against the Sacramento Kings, played 33-year-old guard Ronnie Price — who averaged 1.0 points per game on .167 percent shooting in 14 games — for 19 minutes. A look around the league’s basement-dwellers reveals similar tactics across the board.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And why wouldn’t teams employ this strategy? The NBA is a star-driven league, and stars are found at the top of the draft. The worst thing to be in the NBA is mediocre. The Oklahoma City Thunder rose to prominence thanks to high draft picks, such as Kevin Durant in 2007, Russell Westbrook in 2008 and James Harden in 2009. Their success would not have been possible without losing first.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the reign of Sam Hinkie as general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, tanking came under fire. Purposefully losing games season after season, Hinkie stockpiled assets above all else. Though the losing eventually cost Hinkie his job, the fruits of his labor have ripened. The 76ers now have the unfairly talented — albeit oft-injured — Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons alongside Rookie of the Year contender Dario Saric and a host of other advantageous pick swaps. Philadelphia is widely considered to have one of the brightest futures of all the current non-playoff teams.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The tactic of tanking puts fans in an awkward position. In many cases, it’s better for their teams to lose, but it is not much fun to root for a tanking team. The Lakers won five consecutive games toward the end of the season — and this upset Lakers fan. Tanking is a no-win situation. The fans don’t get to see their team’s best players, and the joy of short-term victory is tainted by long-term loss. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How can this be fixed? A number of theories have gained attention in recent years. One popular proposal is the “wheel,” in which teams would cycle through a certain series of picks, getting the first pick once every thirty years — thirty teams, thirty picks on the wheel — and one top-six pick every five seasons. The issue with this proposal is that it would be easy for bad teams to lose fans. A team could come in last and not have a top pick for another four seasons. As fans of the Brooklyn Nets know, it’s hard enough to wait two seasons — four would be an eternity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sports personality Bill Simmons popularized another possibility, which he calls the “Entertaining-As-Hell-Tournament,” a single-elimination tournament held after the end of the regular season for the eighth seed in the playoffs. While this certainly is a more exciting and intriguing idea, there are problems with its implementation. Scheduling would be an issue — a week-long tournament held after the regular season and before the playoffs would be a hassle for waiting fans of playoff teams. The biggest issue, though, is that this tournament simply wouldn’t matter very much. The NBA playoffs have less parity than other major sports’ postseasons, since it’s easier for stars to dominate the proceedings. A tournament for the honor of being obliterated in four or five games by the first seed isn’t intriguing enough for this to be sustainable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I suggest a far better option: A tournament among the lottery teams for the first pick. This tournament could run concurrently with the first round of the playoffs, eliminating the long waiting period. Fans would be far more invested in the possibility of taking the first pick, as there is a lot more at stake than a lowly first-round exit. Teams would no longer tank in the regular season, since seeding matters. Imagine the drama of a tournament championship next week — Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets versus Hassan Whiteside of the Miami Heat battling it out to play alongside potential number one pick Markelle Fultz in order to form a title contender.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As long as there’s no more Ronnie Price playing big minutes on a languishing, lackadaisical Suns team in front of a bored arena, it’s a win-win.</span></p>

		<title>Flax &#039;17: Fun with MLB’s small sample sizes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As of Wednesday, most Major League Baseball teams have played nine games this season. Any baseball fan could tell you that nine games is surely not enough to evaluate a team, but it is very hard not to fall into that trap when those are the only nine games you have. So let’s <a href="weblink: http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/fangraphs-2017-staff-predictions/">delve into the data</a> so far and see what fun things have happened that will definitely continue all year long.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Cincinnati Reds are 7-2 and have the best record in baseball. None of the 54 experts on the advanced statistics site FanGraphs picked them to make the playoffs. A .778 winning percentage would result in a final record of 126-36 or a full 10 games better than the all-time best 2001 Seattle Mariners.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At 1-7, the Toronto Blue Jays have the worst record in baseball. American League runners-up last season, the Blue Jays were projected by 33 of the 54 FanGraphs predictors to make the playoffs. The team is on pace to finish with a final record of 20-142, which would shockingly only tie them for the fewest wins of all time, matching the 1899 Cleveland Spiders. Of course, the Spiders only played 154 games as opposed to the modern 162, so the 2017 Blue Jays would take the, uh, crown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Reds are led by third baseman Eugenio Suarez, who has a batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage of .429, .529 and .750 respectively — good for a 232 wRC+. wRC+, or weighted runs created plus, is a stat that measures a player’s total offensive contribution and indexes it to a percentage of league average. Suarez is 132 percent better than the average hitter after being 7 percent worse than average last season. He is on pace to have the fifth-best offensive season of all time, only trailing two seasons each from Babe Ruth and Barry Bonds.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In fact, four Reds have a wRC+ of 178 or higher. The highest wRC+ in baseball last year belonged to AL MVP Mike Trout, at 171. Those four Reds have an average career wRC+ of 96. Of course, the Reds are not alone. Thirty-three players have a wRC+ of at least 171 so far this season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This pendulum also swings the other way. The worst full-season wRC+ of all time belongs to Jim Levey, who posted a putrid 23 in 1933. Eighteen players are worse than that so far this year, bottoming out with Byron Buxton’s eye-popping -58 wRC+.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In five at-bats this season, pitcher Madison Bumgarner has hit two home runs. Bumgarner’s career batting average is .186. Meanwhile, infielder Jose Reyes has just two hits in 37 at-bats. He is a career .288 hitter and hit .337 to win the NL batting title in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bumgarner also has more home runs than reigning MLB home run king Mark Trumbo, who launched 47 out of the park last year. But the league leader this year is Houston’s George Springer, who has five home runs in 10 games. At that pace, he would hit 81 home runs this year, shattering Barry Bonds’ record of 73 set in 2001. Or, if you’re less inclined to acknowledge the records of steroid users, Roger Maris’ mark of 61 set in 1961.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The scene is similarly wacky in pitching. Three pitchers so far have gotten every out via the strikeout, which is very impressive. But in their combined 2 2/3 innings, they have allowed eight runs including two home runs. That’s a collective earned run average of 27.00.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">New York Mets starter Noah Syndergaard is off to a hot start, with 0.8 wins above replacement, or WAR, through two games started. WAR is a stat meant to measure how many more games a team would win with a certain player as opposed to a player that could be acquired for nothing, such as from the minor leagues. Syndergaard is on pace to produce 12.8 WAR, which would almost equal the WAR of the top two pitchers from last season combined. Of course, one of those pitchers was him.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is also good and bad news for the league’s bullpens. Nine teams’ relief corps already have a worse ERA than the worst bullpen in baseball last season: the Colorado Rockies, with a 5.13 ERA. Baseball’s two Missourian teams, the Kansas City Royals and St. Louis Cardinals, are both plugging along with a 7.86 bullpen ERA. But 11 teams have a better bullpen ERA than the league-best Los Angeles Dodgers’ 3.35 mark last season. That pack is led by our old friends, the Reds, at 1.23.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So there you have it. Baseball is more polarized than ever, with some of the worst and best seasons of all time primed to happen across every stat category. Eugenio Suarez should start posing for his plaque in Cooperstown; the Blue Jays should start looking for cities to relocate to.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or maybe it’s too early to judge. I guess we’ll see.</span></p>

		<title>Bruno falls to Yale in its fourth Ivy League matchup</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The men’s lacrosse team faced Yale Saturday with the chance to take a pivotal win over the No. 15 Bulldogs (8-3, 5-0 Ivy) and remain in the top half of the conference standings. But despite a 7-7 score at halftime, Yale pulled ahead of the Bears (5-5, 2-2 Ivy) in the second half, defeating Brown 18-12.</p>
<p class="p2">“We had great energy coming into the game again this past weekend,” said midfielder Stephen Hudak ’18. “All of the Ivy games bring out the best in our players.”</p>
<p class="p2">Yale scored first, with Ben Reeves beating first-year goalie Phil Goss ’20 a minute and a half into the game. Reeves caused problems for Bruno through the course of the game, finishing with five goals and five assists. Brown quickly responded, with returning All-American and team co-captain Dylan Molloy ’17 feeding attackman Jackson Newsome ’19 for the score under a minute later.</p>
<p class="p2">With Yale leading 3-1, Hudak and co-captain defenseman Alec Tulett ’17 each added goals to even the score again</p>
<p class="p2">Yale took the lead for the third time with another two-goal run, bringing the score to 5-3. But like clockwork, the Bears’ offense struck twice with two goals in the final 90 seconds of the quarter by Michael Panepinto ’19 and long stick midfielder Larken Kemp ’17 to tie the game at five.</p>
<p class="p2">With four seconds left, Matt Gaudet converted after a quick face-off win for Yale, giving the Bulldogs<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a 6-5 lead as the first quarter closed. Yale kept its momentum, with another goal at 12:33 in the second quarter to take another two-goal lead.</p>
<p class="p2">Molloy contributed a pair of goals twenty seconds apart to tie up the game for a fourth time. The teams exchanged blows for the remainder of the quarter, but Goss made two saves and Phil Huffard notched one to keep the score even at seven going into halftime.</p>
<p class="p2">“We played a good first half,” Hudak said. “We battled at the face off X, we had good shots, and the defense had a great second quarter.”</p>
<p class="p2">Yale went on another offensive surge to begin the third quarter, taking a 10-7 lead that Brown could not erase.</p>
<p class="p2">With less than 10 minutes remaining, Molloy scored on a man up opportunity to bring the score to 15-11. But the Bears could not crawl back any further. Instead, the Bulldogs went on a 4-0 run to close out the remainder of the fourth quarter and take the 18-12 win.</p>
<p class="p2">“We made mistakes that they capitalized on,” Hudak said. “We still have not put together a complete 60-minute game this season and that is what we need to work on.”</p>
<p class="p2">Goss made 15 saves in the loss, one week after a career-high 19 saves against Penn. Yale took 54 shots to Brown’s 46 and held the advantage in ground balls, turnovers forced and face-offs .</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears currently sit in a tie with Cornell for the fourth spot in the Ivy League table and will continue their season Tuesday at Providence College. Saturday, Brown will host the Big Red (4-7, 2-2) for its final home game of the season. Brown will need to maintain its top-four position in the league in order to qualify for the Ivy League tournament and retain the chance to play in the NCAA Championship.</p>
<p class="p2">“We will focus on each day and not look ahead,” Hudak said. “Right now we’re focused on getting better tomorrow at Monday practice.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">The baseball team opened Red Rolfe division play with a four-game series at Dartmouth this weekend, falling to the Big Green Saturday by tallies of 5-1 and 7-1, and splitting Sunday’s contests with a 3-1 loss and a 9-8 victory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(We’re) obviously disappointed with the outcome, and I thought we certainly could have given ourselves a better chance in the games we lost,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles. “They’re a good team that took advantage of the mistakes that we made.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 1, Dartmouth 5</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saturday, the Bears (10-17, 4-8 Ivy) were unable to recover from an early deficit in the series opener. Outfielder Sam Grigo ’18 led Bruno with a pair of hits and a run, but the team could not generate enough offensive output to match the Big Green (18-12, 8-4).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dartmouth opened scoring with four runs — including two unearned on a fielding error — in the bottom of the second. First baseman Marc Sredojevic ’17 responded with an RBI sacrifice fly in the top of the third, sending Grigo home to narrow the deficit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Matt Feinstein added an insurance run in the bottom of the fourth — his third RBI of the contest — to put the game out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starter Christian Taugner ’17 allowed five runs, although just one earned, with two strikeouts in six innings for his fourth loss of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 1, Dartmouth 7</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saturday afternoon’s contest unfolded much like the first game.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sredojevic paced the Bears with two hits, while catcher Josh Huntley ’17 posted an RBI in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Huntley opened scoring in the top of the first, driving outfielder Rob Henry ’17 home on a sacrifice fly. But the Big Green slowly put the game out of reach, responding with multiple runs in each of the second, third and seventh inning. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starter Reid Anderson ’18 allowed five earned runs over two innings while Cameron Deere ’20 and Calvin Farris ’20 combined to limit Dartmouth to one earned run in six innings of relief.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 1, Dartmouth 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The following day saw the Bears fall to Dartmouth in a closer matchup. Five different players posted hits, but Bruno was not able to apply enough offensive pressure to top the Big Green.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Grigo crossed the plate on an error in the top of the first to give the Bears an early advantage, but Michael Ketchmark notched a two-run home run in the bottom of the fourth to reclaim the lead. Ketchmark added an insurance run in the bottom of the sixth to secure the victory for Dartmouth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starter Max Ritchie ’17 allowed three earned runs with two strikeouts over six innings in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 9, Dartmouth 8 (F/10)</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sunday afternoon, the Bears edged the Big Green in extra innings. Deere led the Bears with three hits and three RBIs, while third baseman Willy Homza ’19 notched a pair of hits and three RBIs, including a two-run home run in the ninth inning.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Led by Deere and Huntley, Brown jumped out to a four run lead in the first inning. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Homza added an RBI double in the top of the fifth, but the Big Green responded with four runs in the bottom of the inning to narrow the deficit. Michael Calamari’s RBI single in the bottom of the eighth sent the teams into the ninth tied at five.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After Sredojevic scored on a passed ball in the top of the ninth, Homza drove a two-run a home run to left. The Big Green then responded with three runs to send the game into extra innings. Huntley sent shortstop Rich Ciufo ’20 home on a single in the top of the tenth to clinch the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starter Will Tomlinson ’20 allowed four runs with three strikeouts over five innings, before Dante Bosnic ’18, JJ Sliepka ’19 and Garett Delano ’20 combined to finish the game in relief.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears return to action with a doubleheader at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell Tuesday, before resuming conference play against Harvard at home Saturday and Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s a good opportunity at home, it’s alumni weekend, there should be a lot of excitement,” Achilles said. “We’re just really looking to gain some momentum.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">After a narrow loss to the College of the Holy Cross Thursday, the softball team traveled to Hanover, New Hampshire to face off against Dartmouth in a four-game weekend series. The Bears (11-24, 3-9 Ivy) opened Ivy League North Division play with four losses to the second-ranked Big Green (10-21-1, 9-3 Ivy) and remain at the bottom of league standings.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Brown 1, Dartmouth 5</b></p>
<p class="p4">The first game of Saturday’s double-header remained scoreless until Dartmouth went up 1-0 in the bottom of the fifth. Bruno was able to hold the Big Green to a one-run advantage until the bottom of the sixth when Dartmouth racked up four more runs, bringing the score to 5-0. Grayson Metzger ’18 responded with a solo home run in the top of the seventh, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the four-run deficit.</p>
<p class="p4">Brown was held to just three hits by Dartmouth starter Breanna Ethridge, who threw a complete game with eight strikeouts.</p>
<p class="p4">“After the first game on Saturday, we knew we were close,” said Kaitlin Okimoto ’20. “We just wanted to string hits together because we were really proud of our defense, and we really wanted to up it a little bit on the offensive side.”</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Brown 3, Dartmouth 4</b></p>
<p class="p4">The afternoon game unfolded in similar fashion, as Dartmouth gained a one-run lead in the bottom of the first and clung to it. But in the top of the fifth, Okimoto evened the score with a RBI single. The Bears went up 2-1 the following inning with an RBI single from Julia Schoenewald ’17, but Dartmouth evened the score in the bottom of the frame. An error in the top of the seventh brought Sofia Venegas ’19 home to make the score 3-2.</p>
<p class="p4">But a walk-off two-run home run by Maddie Damore in the bottom of the seventh gave Dartmouth the victory.</p>
<p class="p4">“We adjusted a lot better to the pitcher, and we allowed ourselves to get runs off of consecutive hits, which helped us a lot,” Okimoto said.</p>
<p class="p4">Venegas led Brown with two hits, and starter Meghan Wimmer ’19 threw five innings, allowing two runs on six hits.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Brown 5, Dartmouth 13</b></p>
<p class="p4">Annie McGregor ’18 opened Sunday’s double-header with a two-run home run in the first inning, but Bruno struggled to contain the Big Green for the rest of the game. Eight unanswered runs in the first two innings from Dartmouth stunned the Bears until Cat Seitz ’19 knocked a two-run bomb into left center in the top of the fourth. Dartmouth closed the inning with five more runs, bringing the score to 13-4. Despite another home run from McGregor, the game ended in the fifth due to the mercy rule.</p>
<p class="p4">Dartmouth took advantage of five errors committed by Brown in the contest.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Brown 5, Dartmouth 7</b></p>
<p class="p4">The final game of the series was dominated by Dartmouth, who took a five-run lead into the fourth inning. Seitz and Wimmer each hit solo home runs to left field, and Okimoto followed with a three-run shot to left center, evening the score at five. The tie held until the bottom of the sixth when Dartmouth surged ahead by two, and Brown had no response in the seventh.</p>
<p class="p4">With the 0-4 weekend, Brown falls six games behind the Big Green for first place in the North Division.</p>
<p class="p4">“Our team played hard, and we did our best,” Okimoto said. “We’re going to try and come out against Harvard and in the next weekend against Yale. We still think we’re in this and that we can accomplish a lot more.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears will be back in action Tuesday for a double-header at the University of Rhode Island followed by a four-game series at home against Harvard over the weekend.</p>
<p class="p4">“During (the game against URI) we’re going to really have to try to make sure, as a team, we string hits together and play solid defense all around,” Okimoto said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">The women’s lacrosse team hosted Harvard Saturday at Stevenson-Pincince field in the first contest of a three-game April homestand. While the Bears kept it close initially, two unanswered six-goal runs spelled victory for the Crimson (8-5, 4-1 Ivy). Having lost five of their last six games and without a conference victory on the season, the Bears (4-8, 0-5) share last place in the Ivy League with Dartmouth (5-7, 0-5).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A competitive first eight minutes saw the Bears take a slight 2-3 advantage over the Crimson. But in the ensuing 5:30, Harvard mounted its first run, finding the back of the net six straight times to grab an 8-3 advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Despite the runs Harvard went on, we didn’t stop believing that we would come away with the win and trusted that we could bounce back,” said Hafsa Moinuddin ’19. “As a team, we tried to just revert back to playing Brown lacrosse, executing our game plan and trusting everyone to do their job as best they could.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A 5-0 run for Bruno, including two free position goals from Moinuddin, two tallies from Emma Dahle ’18 and a solo goal from KC Williams ’20, brought the Bears within one. But Harvard answered with three straight for a 12-8 halftime lead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The beginning of the second half saw Moinuddin bag another goal from a free position shot and Zoe Verni ’19 find the net off an assist from Dahle.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In response to their narrowing advantage, Harvard went on another run, again netting six unanswered to grab a 19-10 lead with only 5:51 to play in the second half. The run all but ensured the win for the Crimson.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rachel Vercillo ’20 and Carolyn Paletta ’18.5 tallied the game’s final two goals, but Bruno fell 19-12 ­— the team’s third straight loss.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Harvard picked up 20 ground balls to Brown’s eight and outshot Bruno by a 40-31 margin. Though the Bears were a perfect 2-2 from free position shots in the first half, Brown only finished two of its six free position shots in the second half to go 4-8 on the game. Harvard was a perfect 4-4 from free position shots.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The loss mathematically eliminates Brown from the Ivy League Championship Series. Still, Moinuddin was a bright spot in the defeat, tallying a career-high seven points with four assists and three goals.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I definitely felt good during the game and just kept trusting our systems, knowing we would find the openings,” Moinuddin said. “I knew I needed to challenge hard, and if I got fouled, I wanted to make them pay by finishing my free position shots. My teammates did a great job of getting open and finishing on the feeds I was able to get to them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Paletta and Dahle were also notable contributors to Brown’s offensive effort, each netting two goals and adding an assist.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno will play at home Wednesday under the lights of Stevenson-Pincince field, when the Bears take on the University of Massachusetts Lowell — a squad that has also lost five of its last six matchups.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Going forward, we want to finish out the rest of the season 3-0,” Moinuddin said. “Our team has immense pride in this program and in each other, and despite not being able to make it to the Ivy Tournament, it will still feel good to get wins against Columbia and Dartmouth.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The softball team found mid-week success in two six-inning contests against Ocean State rival University of Rhode Island Tuesday. After scoring only 14 runs in four weekend matchups against Dartmouth (10-21-1, 9-3 Ivy), Bruno (13-24, 3-9), rang up 24 runs in the double header.</p>
<p class="p4">A two-run shot by Annie McGregor ’18 gave Bruno an early 2-0 lead in the first contest. URI (6-29, 3-11) then drew level, scoring one run in each of the first two innings.</p>
<p class="p4">The third inning saw an offensive surge for the Bears. They hammered home six runs, four of which were unearned.</p>
<p class="p4">URI chipped away at Bruno’s 8-2 lead with a solo shot in the bottom of the third and three runs on three hits in the fourth.</p>
<p class="p4">The score remained 8-6 going into the top of the final inning, with Brown holding the two run lead.</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears closed out the contest strong and did not allow Rhody to sneak its way back into the game, and a no-out, two-run bomb by Catherine Seitz ’19, stretched the lead.</p>
<p class="p4">Then back-to-back walks by Christina Andrews ’17 and Grayson Metzger ’18 and an ensuing single by Meghan Wimmer ’19, juiced the bases for rookie Raquel Blanchard ’19. Blanchard knocked a single to left field to score Metzger and Andrews and make the score 12-6.</p>
<p class="p4">A walk and a fielder’s choice put three ducks on the pond again. McGregor stepped up to the plate and cracked a double to center field, bringing home three runs and making the score 15-6.</p>
<p class="p4">Katie Orona ’18 said that much of the Bears’ success came from their patience at the plate. “The other pitchers weren’t throwing as many strikes as what we typically see, and I think we were getting our walks in,” she said. “Then when they would throw strikes or make a mistake we would capitalize on that. So I think offensively we really came through.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears blanked the Rams in the bottom of the sixth to take the first game. The game was called after six innings due to the mercy rule.</p>
<p class="p4">“We came out swinging in the first game,” Andrews said. “We were able to score runs in multiple innings in both games, we played great defense, and we had great pitching to back it up.”</p>
<p class="p4">Kaitlin Okimoto ’20 was a perfect 3-3 in the first game. McGregor (3-4) and Seitz (3-5) also added three hits of their own in the first game.</p>
<p class="p4">Wimmer pitched her sixth win of the season to move her record to 6-8, and Emily Waters ’20 got the save, pitching 2.1 scoreless innings to close out the game.</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno’s bats stayed hot in the second game of the day. Seitz got the Bears started with a two RBI single in the top of the first, scoring Okimoto and McGregor. URI got one back in the bottom of the opening inning on a bases-loaded walk.</p>
<p class="p4">In the top of the second, Okimoto nailed a solo shot — her second home run of the day — to give Brown a 3-1 lead. Both Bruno and Rhody would tally a run in the third, bringing the score to 4-2.</p>
<p class="p4">Five runs on six hits in the final two innings w<span class="s3">ould extend the lead for Brown. URI was unable to drive home a run in the last minutes of the game, and the Bears grabbed the 9-2 win before the game was called for darkness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">McGregor led the Bears offensively in the second game, going 3-4 again. Andrews contributed two hits to Bruno’s efforts as well.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gina Cheiffallo ’17 recorded her first win of the season in a six-inning complete game in which she allowed four hits and only one earned run.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was great to go out there mid-week (and) get some wins after some tough games at Dartmouth and before Harvard this weekend,” Andrews said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With only two weekends left of play in the regular season, the team will square off against Harvard and Yale in a pair of four-game series.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“These two wins were really important to get the momentum going in our direction again, going into this weekend. Harvard’s obviously a big weekend for us, so I think it’s really good that we were able to pull through these two games and invigorate the team’s spirit,” Orona said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re excited,” Andrews said. “We’re going to take the last two weekends we have and see what we can make of it and see if we can make a run farther for the Ivy Championship.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The track and field team collected 10 individual first-place finishes Saturday, as they co-hosted the Ocean State Invitational with Providence College at Brown Stadium. Tosin Oyewole ’18 nabbed two of those titles, with wins in the 400 meter and the 4x100 meter relay. Oyewole also set a new collegiate personal record in the 100 meters with a time of 10.83 seconds, finishing second in the event.</p>
<p class="p2">For his performance, Oyewole has been named The Herald’s athlete of the week.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Herald: Congratulations on winning the 400 meter and the 4x100 relay! How did that feel? </b></p>
<p class="p2">Oyewole: It felt good. It’s nice seeing your hard work pay off during the week and during the off season. For the 4x100 specifically, our anchor leg actually got hurt, so we had to replace him with a freshman, and the freshman did very well. He stepped up, and he executed very well, so I was very proud of him. Then, the 400 went very well. I executed well. I was listening to my coach — he was yelling at me a lot during the race, but that helped me a lot.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Which leg were you in the relay? During your leg, did you know that you were going to win the race?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I was second leg. Second’s a little bit early, but the first leg had a very good start, and by the time I got the baton, I was already past two people. So, at that point, I knew we were in a pretty good spot to win.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>You run quite a few events. Which one is your favorite and why?</b></p>
<p class="p2">The 200 by far. It’s not too short and not too long — I can just sprint the whole way. It’s a lot of fun, a lot of good competition, too.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How do you prepare for meets?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Music — just getting in my zone. I listen to a lot of hip-hop, rap and dubstep to get in the zone. I’ll wake up, usually get some eggs or oatmeal to eat, and then put the earbuds in and get in my zone.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Who’s your favorite artist to listen to?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Kendrick (Lamar), definitely.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you have any pre-meet rituals or superstitions? Good luck charms? </b></p>
<p class="p2">I’ll pray before every single race. Before the meet, I’ll pray for the whole team — like every single competitor — to make sure there are no injuries and that everyone can perform to the best of their ability.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you get nervous before races?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Oh yeah, all the time — I always get nervous. I don’t like losing, so I get a little nervous the night before and the morning of, but after our warm-up, when I step on the track, that fades away.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What are your goals for the rest of the season?</b></p>
<p class="p2">My number one goal is to qualify for regionals in the 400 or the 200. I just want to run 46 seconds in a 400. I’ve run 47 seconds before, so I’m trying to dip into that 46 range, and I know if I do that, I can definitely qualify for regionals. Another goal of mine is to win the 400 at the conference championships. I came in second in indoor, so I’m gunning for the person who won.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Indoor versus outdoor? Which do you like more?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Definitely outdoor. I think the environment in the indoor is better because it’s a closed space, so you can hear the fans more, but I just like the outdoor events more. I don’t like the 60 meter dash indoors — I like the 100 better; I like the 200 better.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b></b>Searching for their first April win, the women’s lacrosse team braved a cold and rainy night for a contest against UMass Lowell on Stevenson-Pincince Field Wednesday. A strong defensive effort propelled the Bears (5-8, 0-5 Ivy) to a 12-6 win over the River Hawks (6-8, 2-5 America East).

Bruno grabbed three early, unanswered goals, the first coming from Hafsa Moinuddin ’19 and the next two from Zoe Verni ’19. The River Hawks grabbed one back on a goal from Jane Dudley, but Bruno tallied three more unanswered finishes to take a 6-1 lead. Dudley scored again, but Emma DeGennaro ’20 responded to give the Bears a 7-2 lead into the halftime break.

Conceding only two goals in the first 30 minutes of play, Bruno’s defense was solid throughout the night.

“It’s a veteran crew (that) was playing smart,” said Head Coach Keely McDonald ’00. “We had a good game plan by our defensive coach, … (and) it was an overall team effort that was strong.”

The beginning of the second half was a defensive gridlock, and for 10 minutes, neither team netted a goal. Dudley scored again to break the drought for the River Hawks, recording a hat-trick in the process.

McDonald attributes Bruno’s lack of early scoring in the second half to over-excitement. We were “probably pushing a little too fast (and) getting a little too excited to generate shots,” she said. “It’s always important once you’ve scored a bunch to stay really poised and maintain discipline and offensive sets.”

Carolyn Paletta ’18.5 snagged Brown’s first goal of the second half with 15:07 remaining in the game, but UMass Lowell’s Hana Caster scored again on a free position shot just two minutes later to bring the score to 8-4. The goal gave the River Hawks the momentum, and they threatened to score more.

But Bruno halted the comeback with goals from Verni and Paletta. Then, with 2:36 remaining to play, Moinuddin collected a pass on a cutting run from behind the net and bounced a shot off the turf to give Bruno a 12-4 lead. It was Brown’s third three-goal burst of the night, and it all but sealed the win for the Bears.

UMass Lowell’s Caster netted two goals in the waning minutes of the half to collect a hattrick, but Brown’s lead proved insurmountable, and the Bears grabbed the 12-6 win.

Moinuddin and Verni led Bruno to victory, each recording four goals in the win.

Brown outshot the River Hawks 31-19, but converted only three of its eight free position shots.

Preparing to finish off the season with two conference contests against Columbia and Dartmouth, the Bears are looking to build off the win.

“We’ve kept improving all season long,” said McDonald. “We want to continue to do that for our final two games.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro ’19: MLB uses a double standard on replay reviews</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Mets played an exciting game last week against the Marlins: Deadlocked at 8-8, they fought into the 16th inning before a Travis d’Arnaud home run and a Hansel Robles save. Hidden within that marathon of a game was a less visible issue, but one that may well be more important. In the top of the seventh, on a bang-bang play at the plate, Yoenis Cèspedes was called <a href="http://m.mlb.com/nym/video/topic/63817564/v1282289683/nymmia-cespedes-out-at-home-after-call-overturned">out</a>. The way in which the conclusion was reached poses a remote but real threat to baseball’s integrity.</p>
<p class="p2">I’ve previously <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/10/21/schapiro-19-lets-clear-convincing/">written</a> about replay in baseball. That time, Adrían Gonzàlez — who was called out at the plate — contested the required “clear and convincing evidence” standard and thought that the call should have been changed. But I disagreed.</p>
<p class="p2">“While it may appear that Gonzàlez may have touched the plate before being tagged, I can’t say definitively that he did,” I wrote.</p>
<p class="p2">That time, the replay umpires got the call right — they avoided the temptation to rule by instinct, and instead, examined the actual evidence available. This time, they did the opposite.</p>
<p class="p2">As Cèspedes sprinted home, Marlins catcher J.T. Realmuto caught the throw and reached back to make the tag. Watching the play live, it wasn’t clear whether he’d made contact with Cèspedes or not. Home plate umpire Àngel Hernàndez thought he had not. Hernàndez called Cèspedes safe, and the Marlins challenged. And that’s when “clear and convincing evidence” came into play.</p>
<p class="p2">Watching the enhanced, slow-motion replays, I had no idea whether Realmuto had tagged Cèspedes or not. If he had, it had been by the absolute slightest of margins: His glove hadn’t changed direction at all. If he had missed him, it was not by much: No space was visible between Realmuto’s glove and Cèspedes’ pants. The replay lasted almost four minutes, and not one shot on the broadcast provided a definitive answer.</p>
<p class="p2">On replay, it looked like Cèspedes was probably out. A preponderance of evidence pointed that way — but barely. Fortunately, replay reviews aren’t determined by the balance of evidence: Rather, by rule, a call can only be changed if replay umpires detect “clear and convincing evidence” that the original call was wrong. It’s essentially the baseball equivalent of the justice system’s “beyond a reasonable doubt” — no call can be changed unless it is certain the change is correct.</p>
<p class="p2">So, by standing replay procedure, there was no way that Cèspedes could have been out. The clearest shot of the play was a zoomed in, blurry, overhead shot — barely Zapruderian in quality — certainly not clear and convincing.</p>
<p class="p2">But Cèspedes was called out. On the basis of a tag that looked like it was there, but that no one could actually see, they changed the call and took the pivotal go-ahead run off the board.</p>
<p class="p2">But what’s the issue with this? What’s wrong with calling it as you see it, and not worrying about showing clear and convincing evidence?</p>
<p class="p2">Once again, I’ll look to the justice system. There’s a reason we require proof beyond a reasonable doubt: no person’s status should ever be changed from “innocent” to “guilty” unless guilt is beyond doubt. If it appears likely that someone committed a crime, that doesn’t mean they can be convicted for it: So long as there’s any level of doubt, a defendant remains innocent. It’s not hard to see that branding a person a criminal and sentencing them to receive punishment is unjust if there is doubt as to whether they actually committed the crime.</p>
<p class="p2">Return to baseball, and the parallels are clear. Baseball doesn’t have such a default: There’s no “innocent until proven guilty.” Rather, its default is simple: the call on the field. If the call on the field cannot be clearly and conclusively disproven, then it stands.</p>
<p class="p2">Why is this correct? Because a call should never be changed from one that might be right to one that might be wrong. If there’s no conclusive evidence either way, then the call cannot be conclusively made either way — which means the original call on the field must stand. There’s no justification for switching it.</p>
<p class="p2">When an MLB manager challenges a call, there are three possible outcomes: call confirmed, call stands or call reversed. Call confirmed means that replay proved the original call correct, and call reversed means that the original call was proven wrong. Call stands is in the middle — and it’s what should happen in the vast majority of cases. It means that there’s no evidence on replay to make a definitive call either way — so the officials stick with the original call, because that’s all they can use.</p>
<p class="p2">I still don’t know whether Realmuto really tagged Cèspedes. I believe that he may have, but that’s not the question. The question is whether I, and the umpires reviewing the play, can tell for certain. In this case,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>­ they could not. No one who saw the replay could have, because there’s simply no evidence either way. He may not have made the tag — and if that’s the case, as it very well may be, the umpires changed a call and cost the Mets the go-ahead run, despite making the correct call all along.</p>
<p class="p2">That should never happen. And that’s why we need the “clear and convincing evidence” standard — and why replay officials need to actually uphold it.</p>

		<title>Blasberg ’18: Has Chris Sale escaped the fate of other first-year Red Sox?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It has become common knowledge that any highly touted player coming to the Red Sox from another team will struggle in his first season. Josh Beckett, Carl Crawford, Hanley Ramírez, Rick Porcello, David Price — the list goes on. Many players attribute their lack of initial success in Boston to the heightened stakes and ruthless fans and media. As a result, when Chris Sale arrived in Boston this offseason, I was not expecting him to pitch to his full potential in his first starts with the Red Sox. Sale proved me wrong, allowing just three runs in his first four starts. His auspicious opening begs the question: Has Chris Sale broken the trend of underperforming first-year Red Sox?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sale has been nothing short of spectacular this season. In four starts for the Red Sox, he has surrendered three runs and struck out 42 in 29.2 innings. Pitching at least seven innings in each of his starts has been invaluable this spring, as the Sox staff has been routinely pummeled in the opening innings, causing the bullpen to be overworked. The one loss on his record is misleading, as he pitched a gem that day — working 7.2 innings and giving up just two runs. Sale’s ability to limit opponents’ contact and to work into the late innings of games will be invaluable to the Red Sox down the road.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sale does most of his damage by getting ahead early in counts. He rarely starts batters off with balls and has only allowed six walks this season. He began Thursday’s start by throwing 32 of his first 36 pitches for strikes and recorded seven strikeouts in the first four innings. His 67.8 percent strike rate keeps his pitch count low and, once ahead in the count, Sale has three primary put-away pitches. His slider and changeup are so effective because his fastball routinely reaches the high 90s, while his off-speed pitches can be in the low 80s. His tall stature and his three-quarter, left-handed delivery often make sliders impossible to hit. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many have compared Sale’s first few starts with the Red Sox to early Boston seasons of Pedro Martínez. Like Martínez, Sale has shown the willingness to pitch inside. Sale, in fact, led the American League in hit batters in both 2015 and 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Of course, it is too early to tell whether Sale will fall victim to the fate of Price, Craig Kimbrel and Ramírez, but he is off to a good start. Generally, when players from other teams come to the Red Sox and struggle in their first years, they begin the season struggling and level out their performance by the end. When Porcello had a disastrous season in 2015, he finished with a string of quality starts through August and September. The same was true for Kimbrel, who had a mediocre start to the season last year, but bounced back from his knee injury and was able to pitch well in August and September.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sale, up to this point, has not needed time to adjust to the Red Sox, even after coming from the Chicago White Sox, a medium-market team whose fans and media coverage do not rival Boston’s. Sale has handled the media gracefully by delivering a consistent message — that his sole focus is winning baseball games. This offers a clear counterpoint to David Price’s soaking up the big stage in Boston. He featured his dog Astro in numerous promotional videos and appeared in Dunkin’ Donuts commercials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sale sees his role in Boston as a pitcher and veteran leader on the Red Sox, not as a media personality. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Based on his hot start on the mound and ability to resist media spotlight outside of baseball, Sale could very well have shattered the mold of first-year Red Sox players who failed to translate success in other cities to Boston.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">After besting Ocean State rival University of Rhode Island in a doubleheader Tuesday, the softball team looked to carry its momentum into a pair of Ivy League North Division doubleheaders against Harvard over the weekend. The Bears (13-27, 3-12 Ivy) returned to the Brown Softball Field for the first time since April 13, but could not capitalize on home field advantage, dropping three straight games to the visiting Crimson (18-16, 9-6 Ivy). </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno opened the series Saturday with a 7-4 loss to the Crimson, despite holding a two-run lead going into the seventh inning. The Bears took an early lead after an RBI groundout from Cat Seitz ’19.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After Harvard evened the score, Seitz responded in the bottom of the fifth with an RBI single. With the score even again at two, Annie McGregor ’18 drove a two-run double to left center to push the Bears ahead in the bottom of the sixth, but Harvard sealed the victory with five unanswered runs in the seventh. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We just couldn’t finish it,” Seitz said. “We still were right there in the last inning and couldn’t finish as strong as we started.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Four Bears had multiple hits in the contest, and Brown held a 10-9 advantage in hits as a team. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After Brown honored the 1997 softball team for the 20th anniversary of its Ivy League Championship,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>officials decided to postpone the second game Saturday due to rain. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears struggled to generate offense in Sunday’s games, dropping the first contest, 4-0. The Crimson pushed across a pair of runs in each of the first two innings and stifled Bruno at the plate. Brown was held to just two hits in seven innings by Harvard starter Taylor Cabe. Katie Orona ’18 threw a complete seven innings, surrendering four earned runs on five hits </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Harvard took an early lead in the final game of the weekend, scoring two runs in the top of the second. McGregor put the Bears on the board with an RBI single, and Seitz knocked an RBI double into center field to tie up the score in the bottom of the third. The game remained tied until Harvard’s Maddy Kaplan doubled with the bases loaded to put the Crimson ahead by three. Despite three singles in the bottom of the sixth, Bruno could not catch up and ended the series with a 5-2 loss.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Meghan Wimmer ’19 took the loss for Brown, throwing a complete game while allowing five earned runs on eight hits.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“After Saturday, we knew we could beat them because we were there in the seventh inning, and we just had little flukes on defense,” Seitz said. “Coming in (on Sunday), we had a ton of confidence that we could be right there with them again, and we showed that in both games up until the very end.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Brown has been eliminated from contention in the North Division and will close its season this weekend against Yale. Brown will travel to New Haven for a doubleheader Saturday before returning home Sunday to play the Bulldogs in another doubleheader on Senior Day.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I just hope we finish strong and finish strong together and give it all we have for our six seniors,” Seitz said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The baseball team continued Red Rolfe division play with a four-game series at home against Harvard this weekend, splitting Saturday’s contests and falling to the Crimson twice Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Harvard 3, Brown 2</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Saturday, the Bears (12-21, 5-11 Ivy) were unable to recover from an early deficit against the Crimson (16-20, 5-11). Outfielder Rob Henry ’17 led Bruno with a 4-4 showing at the plate, scoring two runs.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Harvard opened scoring in top of the second with three runs. Outfielder Sam Grigo ’18 and catcher Josh Huntley ’17 had RBI’s in the third and fifth, respectively, but Bruno was unable to generate enough offense to match the Crimson.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“We had opportunities that we didn’t capitalize on, and they did,” Henry said. “That’s happened to us all year. We just have to find a better way to execute one through nine.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“We had too many strikeouts in key spots with guys in scoring position,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles. “They had that one big inning, and we just couldn’t bounce back and continue to score.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Starter Christian Taugner ’17 took the loss, allowing three runs and striking out three over seven innings.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 7, Harvard 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The afternoon’s contest saw Bruno mount a comeback from an early three-run deficit. Huntley led the Bears with three hits and two RBIs — including his third home run of the season — while Henry notched a trio of hits and scored twice. Brown posted 11 hits in the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Harvard struck first, recording three runs in the opening two innings to claim the early advantage. But Brown responded with six runs in the bottom of the third, capitalizing on two errors, to put the game out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Henry crossed the plate on an error before Huntley hit a two-run home run to even the score at three. Outfielder Garett Delano ’20 and third baseman Willy Homza ’19 added back-to-back RBIs before Homza scored on an error.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“You’ve got to respond when they score,” Henry said. “When you score, you’ve got to shut them down the next inning, and we take pride in that as hitters.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Starter Will Tomlinson ’20 allowed three runs with six strikeouts over six innings before Sam Hauser ’17 and Dante Bosnic ’18 combined for three scoreless innings in relief.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“We got a great team win,” Achilles said. “For the guys to be able to throw seven straight zeros after giving up three in the first two innings was clutch.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Harvard 4, Brown 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Sunday, the Crimson edged the Bears in a closer matchup. Harvard starter Simon Rosenblum-Larson kept Bruno off the basepaths with eleven strikeouts and allowed only one run in six innings.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The Crimson opened scoring with two runs in the top of the second before adding runs in the sixth and the seventh to secure the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">After scoring twice in the bottom of the seventh to bring the game within a run, the Bears hit into a double play with the bases loaded to end the game.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“I have, in my years of playing and coaching, never seen a game end like that,” Achilles said. “The best thing for me was how our guys competed.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Starter Max Ritchie ’17 allowed four runs with two strikeouts over seven innings.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Harvard 7, Brown 6 (F/11)</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The afternoon contest saw Bruno overtaken by the Crimson in a tight, extra-innings contest. Henry led the Bears with two hits and a pair of runs scored, while Grigo posted one hit and two RBIs.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Harvard scored two runs in the first three innings, but Bruno responded in the bottom of the seventh when Homza sent Cameron Deere ’20 home on an RBI groundout. The Crimson answered with a three-run eighth inning, but Deere narrowed the deficit with an RBI single in the bottom of the inning.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Brown had a run taken off the board in the eighth inning after the umpire ruled that Huntley failed to touch third base before crossing home on a single from Delano, sending Brown into the ninth inning down three runs. Achilles was ejected from the game following an appeal of the call.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“If anything, what that (call) did is it brought our guys closer,” Achilles said. “It brought them to a point where they weren’t going to let anything affect them negatively that they couldn’t control.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Harvard added a run in the top of the ninth, but Bruno answered with four runs — led by Grigo, Marc Sredojevic ’17 and Huntley — to send the game into extra innings tied at six. Trent Bryan hit a home run to left center in the top of the eleventh, securing the victory for the Crimson.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Delano started the game on the mound and limited Harvard to two runs with five strikeouts over seven innings before Hauser and Reid Anderson ’18 combined for four innings of relief.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“They continued to battle,” Achilles said. “Our guys were always delivering, (but) we just didn’t get the big one when we needed it.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The Bears will return to action Tuesday with a home doubleheader against Siena College, before finishing the season with a pair of doubleheaders against Yale Saturday and Sunday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">With only two Ivy League games left its season and sitting at .500 in conference play, the men’s lacrosse team headed into its last home game against Cornell needing to pick up a win in order to keep its postseason hopes alive. The Bears (7-5, 3-2 Ivy) did just that, taking a 13-10 victory over the Big Red (4-8, 2-3 Ivy) at Stevenson-Pincince Field Saturday. Brown was lifted by a four-goal, three-assist performance by returning All-American and team co-captain Dylan Molloy ’17.</p>
<p class="p4">“We were excited after our win against Providence Tuesday,” said Jack Kniffin ’20. “We felt that we had momentum coming into the game against Cornell. Although it was Senior Day, we wanted to focus on pulling out the win against a very good team.”</p>
<p class="p4">Cornell started off scoring, with Connor Fletcher beating goalie Phil Goss ’20 to put the Big Red on the board. But the Bears responded immediately after midfielder Ted Ottens ’17.5 secured the ensuing face-off and scored just six seconds later to tie the game at one.</p>
<p class="p4">For the remainder of the first quarter, the teams traded goals, with Luke McCaleb ’20, Michael Panepinto ’19 and Molloy all contributing to give Bruno a 5-4 lead after 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="p4">After Brown broke a 5-5 tie with a two-goal run from Jackson Newsome ’19 and Molloy,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the Big Red cut Bruno’s lead to one heading into the second half as Jeff Teat slotted one in with just 21 seconds remaining</p>
<p class="p4">“We traded blows all the way through the first half,” Kniffin said. “Cornell wasn’t going to hand us a win, we were going to have to earn it.”</p>
<p class="p4">Once again, the Big Red opened up scoring, with a goal by Jake McColloch to the game at seven. But Bruno’s offense surged, as the team embarked on a three-goal run, capped by Molloy at 7:31 to complete his ninth hat trick of the season.</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears’ 10-7 lead did not last long, as a solo effort by Jordan Dowiak brought the Big Red within two. But a pair of goals from Panepinto and Stephen Hudak ’18 gave the Bears a 12-8 lead, the team’s largest of the game.</p>
<p class="p4">“We came out in the second half and capitalized on our opportunities,” Hudak said. “Ted had an amazing day at the face off X and Phil played well in goal again.”</p>
<p class="p4">Cornell rallied in the fourth quarter with two goals at 8:55 and 7:44 to cut the Bears’ lead to two. But this surge was too little, too late.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the remaining minutes, Brown’s defense held fast, with Goss making seven of his 14 saves in the fourth quarter to hold Cornell at 10.</p>
<p class="p4">“The third quarter, we started to pull away,” Kniffin said. “Our defense played fantastic in the second half. Phil Goss came up with some huge saves, and at one point in the fourth quarter, our defense strung together three or four great defensive possessions in a row to preserve the lead.”</p>
<p class="p4">Individually, Molloy led both teams in the win with four goals. The performance brought his career total to 191, putting him in a tie for fifth-all time on the NCAA Division I scoring leaderboard. Molloy’s 37-game scoring streak — dating back to April 4, 2015 — is also the longest in the nation.</p>
<p class="p4">Long stick midfielder Larken Kemp ’17 also made an impact in the contest, with four caused turnovers and four ground balls. Kemp’s 112 career caused turnovers ranks seventh in NCAA history.</p>
<p class="p4">With the win, Brown clinches the third seed in the Ivy League tournament and will face second-ranked Princeton in the first round. The Bears will head to Bryant Tuesday and finish off regular-season play at Dartmouth Saturday.</p>
<p class="p4">“Everyone always gets pumped up for conference games, and this one will be the same,” Hudak said. “Having the opportunity to finish 4-2 in conference obviously also gets the team a little more jacked up.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b>Hot off a 12-6 win over the University of Massachusetts Lowell, the women’s lacrosse team took the field Saturday for its penultimate contest of the season against Columbia. The matchup was Bruno’s last home game of the season, and the seniors — Jillian Lee ’17, Mollie Lane ’17, Kerianne Hunt ’17, Sarah Peters ’17 and Ali Kim ’17 — were honored before the game. After a hard-fought, overtime contest in which neither team would lead by more than three goals, Brown (6-8, 1-5 Ivy) won the matchup 14-13 to snag its first conference win.</p>
<p class="p4">A pair of goals by each team in the first 10 minutes knotted the game at 2-2 . Then, back-to-back goals by the Lions (7-7, 2-4) were answered by a pair from Bruno to tie the game again at four apiece.</p>
<p class="p4">Brown went into the halftime break down 7-5. At the half, Columbia was 3-4 from free position shots, while Brown was 1-1.</p>
<p class="p4">The Lions scored again out of the break, netting their fourth straight goal and grabbing an 8-5 lead — Columbia’s largest of the game. But Brown fought back, and four unanswered goals from Hafsa Moinuddin ’19, Bri Irons ’18, KC Williams ’20 and Zoe Verni ’19 gave Bruno an 11-10 lead with 16:42 to play.</p>
<p class="p4">Brown eventually took a 13-11 lead after a pair of goals, one each from Emma DeGennaro ’20 and Marissa Hudgins ’18. Columbia’s Laine Parsons netted two goals in the final 3:07 to draw the Lions level and force the game to overtime.</p>
<p class="p4">DeGennaro nailed an unassisted goal 5:22 into the overtime period to give Bruno the 14-13 win.</p>
<p class="p4">“It was just like a rush of adrenaline,” DeGennaro said. “We were a man down, and our coach just kept saying ‘if you get doubled, it doesn’t matter, just go to the cage,’ and I just knew when I got that ball that’s what I needed to do.”</p>
<p class="p4">Columbia narrowly outshot the Bears in the contest by a 33-30 margin. The Lions also scooped up 24 ground balls to Brown’s 12, and both teams were 4-8 from free position shots. Both the Lions and the Bears spilled 23 turnovers apiece.</p>
<p class="p4">DeGennaro tallied three goals and two assists, Moinuddin added two goals and one assist and Lee contributed one goal and two assists in the effort.</p>
<p class="p4">DeGennaro said that Senior Day provided extra motivation for Bruno. “It was our last game on Stevenson with the seniors, and … that energy just gave us the edge,” she said. “Of course, we’re sad that the seniors are leaving but also excited to take on our last home game with them.”</p>
<p class="p4">“Just knowing how far they’ve pushed us this season, … just knowing that they leave everything they have on the field, … we wanted to do the same thing for them,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno faces its final test of the season Saturday when it takes on Dartmouth. While the team is out of postseason contention, they are still motivated.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’ve been talking about playing out the rest of the season for Brown pride,” DeGennaro said. “Despite any of the losses we took this season, we just knew we wanted to finish out … strong, get these two Ivy wins and just never stop playing Brown lacrosse.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">Three years ago, Bre Hudgins ’14 netted a game winning overtime goal against Princeton to give Bruno its first win over the Tigers since 1991.</p>
<p class="p4">Hudgins went on to score a Brown single-season record 40 goals in her senior year and earned consecutive Second Team Northeast All-Region honors in 2013 and 2014. She is “just an extremely reliable competitor,” said Head Coach Keely McDonald ’00, who coached Hudgins for four years. If the “game’s on the line, she wants the ball,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">Now a few years removed from her glory days as one of Brown’s most prolific women’s lacrosse players, Hudgins has the opportunity to continue her career at the professional level — she was drafted by the Boston Storm of the United Women’s Lacrosse League April 17.</p>
<p class="p4">The UWLX was co-founded by Digit Murphy, former head coach of the Brown women’s hockey team, in 2016, The Herald previously reported.Entering its second season, the league consists of four teams located in Long Island, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Boston.</p>
<p class="p4">Hudgins currently works as a third grade teacher in Providence and is in her third year as an assistant coach for women’s lacrosse team. Her younger sister, Marissa Hudgins ’18, plays attack for the Bears.</p>
<p class="p4">After graduating, Hudgins leapt at the opportunity to continue working with the program. “I learned a lot from Brown lacrosse,” she said. “It’s not like I owe a lot to Brown lacrosse, but I was in Providence and the chance to still be a part of the program — but play a very different role — was very exciting for me. On top of that, I never got to play with my sister Marissa, so this is the closest that we’ve ever been to playing (together).”</p>
<p class="p4">Hudgins stays in shape by practicing with the team whenever she can, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">Hudgins is “even better as a coach, if possible,” McDonald said. “She cares so much about the players, and her sister’s on the team, so obviously she’s really connected to the group. She’s really family at this point — family for the program, family for the coaching staff.”</p>
<p class="p4">In teaching and in coaching, Hudgins applies similar techniques: motivating students or players, reminding them of their strengths and helping them see the bigger picture, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">McDonald has no doubt that Hudgins will fit in well with the Storm. Many of Hudgins’ skills will translate well to the next leve, such as “her game sense, her ability to finish left and right handed, … her level of competition,” McDonald said. “And and once she’s around all those great players, I think she’ll fit seamlessly with the crew there.”</p>
<p class="p4">The UWLX season is a ten-week campaign that runs from May to August. This allows Hudgins to continue teaching and coaching throughout the offseason.</p>
<p class="p4">While she is not sure if she will get paid for her play in the UWLX, Hudgins is pleased to have the opportunity to play professional lacrosse. “(It’s) a great chance for women in general, and now that I have the chance to play in it, it’s super exciting,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Hudgins and the Boston Storm kick off their 2017 season May 27.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Berman ’77 reflects on time at Brown, ESPN</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This past January, longtime sports broadcasting icon Chris Berman ’77 P’08 P’09 announced he would be assuming a less-involved role at ESPN after the 2016 National Football League season. Berman has been with the network since its inception in 1979 and has covered 31 NFL seasons as ESPN’s studio programming host. The upcoming 2017 NFL Draft will be the first televised draft not hosted by the six-time National Sportscaster of the Year. Over his career, Berman has also been involved with ESPN’s golf and MLB coverage. The Schwami — as he has been affectionately referred to by coworkers, athletes and fans alike — has been featured on the video screens before Brown football games and has remained tied to the University and its athletic department since he graduated. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In an exclusive interview with The Herald, Berman discussed his career development, his time at Brown and his plans moving forward.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: Reflecting on your career development and your time at ESPN so far, what parts stand out to you the most?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Berman: All of them, because I had fun in all of them. I always look longingly back to the ’80s. By the end of the ’80s, (ESPN got) the (NFL), which people thought was a pipe dream when we went on the air. And I was the main anchor for the NFL — that’s a pretty good gig. I had dreamt about it in college watching Brent Musberger, and I was doing it. But this year, I knew before the public knew that it would be the last time. It was a really fun season. It’s hard to say — there are so many different eras and times, and so much that you learn. There’s no period that I wondered, ‘What I am I still doing here?’ Imagine getting a promotion every year but never having to leave. That was ESPN in the ’80s and ’90s. Imagine a place that got bigger as you got bigger. It was a perfect storm, and I was lucky enough to be a part of it.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>How did you to get into sports broadcasting?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4">(My family) went to New York Jets games the year they moved to Shea Stadium — I was nine. The tickets were eight dollars for box seats. When I was ten, (the Jets) got Joe Namath. When I was 13, they won the Super Bowl. … It was in my blood. I was an okay athlete — played high school sports, but that was it. We even had a little radio station in high school, and on Saturday were the football games, so I announced them to the 100 people that might have been listening. … My freshman week (at Brown), in addition to the orientation, I went up to the radio station, introduced myself and said ‘I’m here to help.” But WBRU was my start — I became the voice of the Bruins. We were the Bruins then, … and by the time I was done with Brown, I had long known that I wanted to do it for a living if I was lucky enough. At WBRU, I definitely cut my teeth there.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Why did you decide to come to Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I spent one night at Brown, and I felt at ease with the students. I felt like it was an Ivy League school where no one was overly impressed with themselves, and I didn’t find the same thing anywhere else. You knew that you were with intelligent folks from everywhere. You knew that the opportunities were boundless. I felt a comfort. I found everything to be very natural. I ended up applying early to Brown, and they were foolish enough to accept me. I smile every time I come up there.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>What were you involved in while here at Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I wrote for the BDH my freshman year every week. You can go back to the ’73 fall, and you’re gonna find a lot of articles on Brown football and basketball. I did that and the radio. I hope I wrote in complete sentences.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>How did your trademark style as a broadcaster develop?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I was always upbeat. See, my style is really just an extension of me as an upbeat guy, excited about sports. That stuff came out in my early days at ESPN, not as a design to be “famous” or even funny. ESPN needed a few of us young ones to talk about sports, in my case at 2:30 in the morning — which was 11:30 in California — since I was the junior guy. I was on for half an hour a night, and at 2:30 in the morning, you are taking some chances, as the bosses aren’t awake. When I started, there were only 70 of us. There are 7,000 now. I think Brown is kind of “sink or swim” a little bit, and it was that way at the radio station. At ESPN, we were figuring things out on our own — to just to have the confidence to go out and do it, just as we did at school. I think Brown really helped me that way subconsciously.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Do you continue to follow Brown sports?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4">I actually went to (the NCAA men’s lacrosse semifinal) against Maryland. I went to Philly for it. I was so proud of us. I know we lost, but so what? I spoke to the team afterwards. I told them how proud of them I was as an old alum. Football, I am certainly quite involved with. (Head Coach Phil Estes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>P’19) is wonderful, and Brown couldn’t have a better ambassador.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Moving forward, what are your plans professionally and personally?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4">Moving forward professionally, I want to keep my hand in (ESPN). I have some good friends in baseball, football and golf — making sure that I keep my relationships. That’s important. I want to have an ear to the fans still. But boy, I have a lot to smile about. I guess it’s most important to keep things in perspective. I don’t have a plan yet, I guess it’s almost like taking the air out of your tires, but you can still drive.</p>

		<title>Three Bears selected in Major League Lacrosse Draft</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/06/07/three-bears-selected-major-league-lacrosse-draft/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three seniors decided to forego the ceremonial commencement march through the Van Wickle Gates Sunday, instead opting to hear their names get called elsewhere.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They had good reason. Former Brown Lacrosse standouts Dylan Molloy ’17, Larken Kemp ’17 and Alec Tulett ’17 were selected in the Major League Lacrosse draft.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first Bear off the board was Molloy, selected number one overall by the Florida Launch. His selection in the draft was a culmination of his efforts at Brown over the past four years.  “Coming out after getting my name called and holding up the jersey — that was really surreal,” Molloy said. “(It was) just an honor, really.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bruno attacker garnered many honors in the 2016 season, winning the Tewaaraton Award, United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) Outstanding Player and USILA Outstanding Attackman. Molloy racked up 118 points and led the nation in goals and assists that season. He is also the all-time leading scorer in program history.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Launch also selected defenseman Alec Tulett in the fourth round with the 29</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overall pick. Tulett earned second-team USILA All-American honors his junior year, and he was named a USILA honorable mention this past season.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Molloy and Tulett will be joining former Bear and face-off specialist Will Gural ’16 in Florida. Molloy is looking forward to playing with some familiar faces. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tullett’s been one of my roommates, so I’m close with Alec” he said. “And reconnecting with Will Gural, that’ll be a lot of fun. He’s great on the faceoff-X, and we both really enjoy playing with Will and with each other, so we’re going to have a great time,” he added.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While Molloy and Tulett bookended the draft for the Bears, Kemp was drafted as well. Kemp, a midfielder who was named Second-Team USILA his senior season a year after receiving first-team honors his junior year, was selected in the second round, 17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overall, by the Denver Outlaws.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kemp will be joining two former teammates — Jack Kelly ’16 and Bailey Tills ’16 — who play for the Outlaws. Tills and Kelly have already found success in the league, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/21/pro-lacrosse-team-reunites-two-mens-lacrosse-alums/">previously reported</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kelly was named Rookie of the Year last season – the first goalie to receive the honor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’ll be pretty fun going against a couple of guys that you’ve suited up with for so many years,” Molloy said, noting that he is especially looking forward to playing Kemp, Kelly, and the Outlaws.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The former Bears don’t have much time to revel in their accomplishments, as their first professional seasons have already begun.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Right-handed pitcher Christian Taugner ’17 and outfielder Rob Henry ’17 were drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers Wednesday, marking the first time multiple Bears were selected in the same year since 2005.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a record-setting career with the Bears, Taugner was chosen in the 37th round of the 40-round draft.. He led Bruno with a 2.64 career ERA over 170 innings. As a senior, he totaled 35 strikeouts and just 12 walks in a team-high 60.0 innings. He was awarded Second Team All-Ivy honors and had was second in the league in conference ERA at 2.65. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taugner has been on the team’s regular weekend rotation since his freshman year. After a promising rookie year, he missed his sophomore season <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/26/taugner-17-recovers-from-ucl-tear-to-lead-brown-pitching-staff/">after undergoing Tommy John surgery on his elbow</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m speechless,” Taugner said. “It’s always been a dream to get drafted, and it finally happened.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“My time at Brown made me grow a lot as a pitcher,” he added. “It was a really tight-knit community, and everyone wanted everyone to succeed.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry was drafted in the 39th round after starting in center field in all 37 of Bruno’s games this season. In 2017, he posted a .390 batting average in conference play and led the Bears with 31 runs scored and 9 stolen bases overall. Henry earned unanimous First Team All-Ivy honors this season after being named to the Second Team during his sophomore campaign. He finished with 176 hits in 152 career games.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m very happy to have the opportunity to keep playing baseball,” Henry said. “I’m just glad that all the work I’ve put in in the last four years and beyond has paid off.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s not one thing you can do to help yourself play at the next level — there’s a thousand things you have to do,” Henry added. “It’s a journey.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Taugner and Henry played in the Cape Cod Baseball League in summer 2016. Taugner represented the Wareham Gatemen and Bourne Braves, while Henry also took the field for the Braves.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Attanasio ’79, the owner of the Brewers, donated the main gift for the recent renovation of Brown’s baseball and softball fields<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/06/30/construction-begins-on-new-baseball-softball-complex/"> at Erickson Athletic Complex.</a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taugner and Henry follow left-handed pitcher Austin French ’16, who was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 27th round of the 2016 draft. In 2005, Matthew Kutler '05 and Eric Larsen '05 were chosen in the 24th and 44th rounds, respectively.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Brown player has not appeared in an MLB game since 1988, when Bill Almon '75 suited up for the Philadelphia Phillies in the last season of his 15-year career. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The women’s soccer team (3-1, 0-0 Ivy) opened its 2017 season strong by winning three of its first four games.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 2, Maine 1 F/OT </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">A pair of solid performances from rookies Star White ’21 and Zeinab Kante ’21 fueled the Bears to an overtime victory in its season opener Aug. 25.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Kante scored the golden goal in the 98th minute, launching a shot into the back of the net from just outside the box.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Scoring that goal felt like a championship win,” Kante said. She was later named Ivy League Rookie of the Week for her performance. “Everyone got up on their feet celebrating, and it felt really nice, but also, I had to remember to not let that get to my head — that was literally my first game and first goal.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">White’s 82nd-minute equalizer had sent the teams into overtime deadlocked at one. White and Kante registered an assist on each other’s goals.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Brown peppered the Maine goal with shots, accruing ten to the Black Bears’ three.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 3, Rhode Island 2 F/2OT</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Two days after its season-opening win, Brown faced off with Rhode Island in an in-state rivalry match. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Celia Story ’19 led Bruno with a pair of goals, including the game-winner in double overtime.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Story converted a penalty kick in the 104th minute after Rhode Island matched Brown’s early lead in the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Veteran goalkeeper and 2016 Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year Christine Etzel ’18 made eight saves in the matchup, blocking back-to-back shots on a breakaway and corner kick four minutes into play.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 4, Hartford 0</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Veteran Mikela Waldman ’18 posted her first career hat trick as Bruno earned its first shutout at Hartford Aug. 31.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“All the goals that we scored that game were really team goals,” Waldman said. “They were all really good buildup plays. … Jennifer Caruso ’19 did a really good job of getting the ball on the line and getting it to the middle, and it made it easy for me to tap the ball in.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Abby Carchio ’20 added a goal in the 34th minute as Brown’s offense dominated the field. Bruno doubled Hartford’s shot total, eight to four.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In net, Etzel shared her first season shutout with Rylee Shumway ’18.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 1, Vermont 2 F/OT</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Despite outshooting the host Catamounts 13-11, the Bears were unable to capitalize as the team’s winning streak came to an end in overtime.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Caruso scored Bruno’s lone goal of the evening, slipping a left-footed shot past the goalkeeper in the 72nd minute.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Our team still hasn’t really found the fluidity yet that is going to come in the rest of the season even though we’ve gotten good results the first four games,” Waldman said. “It’s really good to be able to get those results early on, but I still think our team is very much aware that we haven’t played anywhere close to our potential.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The squad will seek to build on the successes of the 2016 season, which resulted in a second-place conference finish.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Last year (Brown) came really close to being first place, so this year, as a team, we have to prove ourselves,” Kante said. “It’s nice coming in that everyone believes that we’re going to be winning this year — it’s a lot of pressure on the freshmen coming in, but it’s a good thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Brown hosts Providence College at 7 p.m. Thursday at Stevenson-Pincince Field before Lafayette comes to town Sunday. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Following an overtime loss to Vermont Saturday, the women’s soccer team returned home to Stevenson-Pincince Field to play its crosstown foe Providence College. While Brown (3-2) leads the overall series 20-9-0, PC (2-4) has dominated as of late. In their 29th matchup, PC emerged victorious for the fifth straight year, leading for the entirety of the game with a 3-1 win. Star White ’21 prevented the shutout by scoring her second goal of the season on an empty net in the second half, but the Bears weren’t able to capitalize on their late offensive surge.</p>
<p class="p3">“I’m excited that I was able to score but disappointed that it was at the end of the game because we didn’t have as much time to go off the momentum,” said White.</p>
<p class="p3">Prior to White’s tally, the opening half was highlighted by shots from multiple Brown players including midfielder Jennifer Caruso ’19. But Providence controlled the game on offense, outshooting the Bears eight to six and netting three goals in the half. Co-captain and 2016 Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year Christine Etzel ’19 made a clutch save at 37:56, stopping the Friars from going up by four before halftime. Abby Carchio ’20 made the Bears’ final offensive effort in the first half in the 39th minute of play but was blocked by Providence’s Shelby Hogan.</p>
<p class="p3">Brown came out strong in the second half, outshooting PC 10 to four and putting pressure on the Friars in the midfield. Etzel also recorded 4 more saves. But this effort was not enough for the Bears to overcome the two-goal deficit, with the score reading 3-1 as the final buzzer sounded.</p>
<p class="p3">“Every year, this game is a battle,” Head Coach Kia McNeill said. “I thought the game itself was better than the score indicated. It was the tale of two halves. They had the better run of the game in the first half, and we had the better run in the second half. It just comes down to finishing your opportunities.”</p>
<p class="p3">Coach McNeill also suggested potential formation changes for the upcoming games. “We have a lot of dangerous players in the attacking third. I think playing a little bit more of an offensive formation will help that. … Despite the loss, I’m really proud of our team. We were resilient in the second half. We could have hung our heads and dipped out of this game, but we didn’t. We kept fighting back.”</p>
<p class="p3">The Bears will continue their season Sunday hosting Lafayette College. Bruno’s first Ivy League contest will fall against Dartmouth September 24.</p>
<p class="p3">“These games are really trying to get us primed and ready for Ivy League play,” McNeill said. “We’re trying to get better and better every game and to put the pieces of the puzzle together to make sure that we have the best formation going forward into our first game against Dartmouth. We want to peak at the right time.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The New England Patriots are expected to dominate this NFL season. The team had the best Vegas odds, 6-1, to win the Super Bowl as of Monday, and many pundits give New England an even better shot than that. Though the Pats recently lost wide receiver Julian Edelman for the season to an ACL tear, the team is still an intimidating force after a few key offseason additions. The acquisition of wide receiver Brandin Cooks via a trade with the New Orleans Saints stands out especially. Cooks accumulated 1,173 yards and eight touchdowns last season and should see an improvement in both figures with Belichick and Brady relying on him as an important part of New England’s offense. Cooks could become the Patriots’ best receiver in several years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it goes without saying that New England will dominate the AFC East on the way to the playoffs — unfortunately so for this sad New York Jets fan — the question remains whether any team can stop the Pats from yet another Super Bowl win. After all, talk of a 19-0 season has already popped up. The following teams are the best hope for the rest of the country to avoid another New England celebration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Atlanta Falcons were only a few minutes away from winning the Super Bowl before their collapse. Up 28-3 at one point in the second half, the Falcons choked throughout the fourth quarter before losing in overtime. Atlanta’s blueprint for this season is similar to last year. Matt Ryan and Julio Jones need to overpower the Pats’ defense for the Falcons to win, along with a solid running game from Devonta Freeman. The Falcons almost won the Super Bowl without incredible performances from those three: Ryan threw for 284 yards and two touchdowns, Jones compiled 87 yards and Freeman went for 75 yards and a touchdown. Better games from them could put the Falcons over the top. A more balanced defense would work wonders as well. Atlanta felt pressured to score a lot last year to make up for the defensive side of the game, forcing themselves into offensive mistakes during the Super Bowl.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, it remains to be seen whether Atlanta can emotionally come back from the Super Bowl letdown. To come so close to a championship only to watch it slip away is brutally painful. The first couple weeks of the regular season will be telling in regards to the Falcons’ mental response.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Green Bay Packers are tied for the fourth best Vegas odds at 12-1 for one reason alone: Aaron Rodgers. Any team that has the best quarterback in the world on its roster has a chance to win it all. The NFL playoffs, with their do-or-die format, are ripe for surprise postseason runs from teams that get hot at the right moments. Rodgers has done it before: he led the Packers to a 2011 Super Bowl Championship, winning the most valuable player award in the big game. The 33-year-old is still at the peak of his powers. Last season’s performance was one of his best yet with 4,428 passing yards, 40 passing touchdowns, only seven interceptions and two playoff wins, including a dramatic victory over the favored Dallas Cowboys.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the other players around Rodgers will need to step up for the Packers to win this season’s Super Bowl. At the end of the day, one player can only do so much, an issue that surfaced when the Falcons demolished the Packers 44-21 in the NFC Championship. If running back Ty Montgomery can take his game to the next level, he could become a huge part of this Packers team. Suddenly, defenses would have more to look out for than just Rodgers, Jordy Nelson and new tight end Martellus Bennett. Green Bay’s defense needs to improve as well — they allowed the 11th most yards in the NFL last season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Seattle Seahawks are another team that almost beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl before losing in devastating fashion. The Seahawks are stacked with their usual suspects. Quarterback Russell Wilson is right in his prime. Cornerback Richard Sherman, and safeties Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas are ready to lead Seattle’s fearsome defense once again. And defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson, acquired in a trade with the Jets, can bring another boost to the Seahawks’ defensive line. But he needs to bounce back from a couple of poor seasons in New York and play up to his potential without being a divisive force in the locker room.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Seattle has fallen short during the playoffs in the past couple of seasons, letting opposing offenses dominate. In back-to-back years, Cam Newton and Matt Ryan overwhelmed the Seahawks in the first half. The Seahawks will need to show up ready to play from the beginning if they want to take down the Patriots.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Pittsburgh Steelers, Dallas Cowboys and Oakland Raiders also have a chance to defeat New England. But that chance is tiny. The Patriots are the favorites for good reason, and it seems more than likely that New England’s powerful offense and stingy defense will run roughshod over the rest of the National Football League. Belichick, Brady and company are on track to win their third Super Bowl in four years.</span></p>

		<title>Blasberg &#039;18: How Long Can These Red Sox Last in October?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From the beginning of spring training, the 2017 Red Sox have had realistic playoff expectations. The offseason acquisition of ace pitcher Chris Sale solidified the Red Sox as a premier World Series contender before the season even started. Though they boast a 79-61 record ­— good enough for first in the American League East — the Red Sox have had a season riddled with injury, inconsistency and immaturity, raising serious questions about how far they can make it in the postseason. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Red Sox pitching staff has risen to the occasion all season and will be the engine behind the team come October. The biggest key to winning in the postseason is pitching, and that is something the Red Sox have in spades, though not in the form many would have expected. The rotation doesn’t look how it was drawn up in April, but has still managed 79 quality starts, the second most in baseball, and a solid team Earned Run Average of 3.73, which ranks fourth in the Major League Baseball. Buoyed by Cy Young favorite Chris Sale and shutdown closer Craig Kimbrel, the rest of the pitching staff<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>has followed suit. Despite injuries to David Price and Stephen Wright, the starting rotation has managed remarkably well, with Doug Fister and Drew Pomeranz assuming major roles. Fister<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>has not yielded more than two runs in his last four starts while Pomeranz has been remarkable since mid-May.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The bullpen is also a huge asset, evidenced by the 13 scoreless innings posted in Tuesday’s extra-inning marathon against the Blue Jays. It is rife with hard throwers like Joe Kelly and Matt Barnes and equipped with effective lefties Addison Reed and Robbie Scott. The Sox’ stingy bullpen and the advantageous match ups it offers will be instrumental come October, when runs are at a premium and high-leverage, late-game situations come around more often.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While Mookie Betts, Xander Bogaerts and Hanley Ramirez have been struggling offensively this season, the pitching staff has been able to keep games within striking distance down the stretch. This has given the team the ability to come back from early deficits as well as walk off ten times this season. The Red Sox have a remarkable 13-3 record in extra-inning games, and much of the credit goes to the pitching staff — especially the bullpen ­— for keeping the team in the game long enough for the offense to come up with game-winning runs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">John Farrell has been heavily criticized for mismanaging the pitching staff over the last two seasons, but he has improved these efforts by defining clear roles in the bullpen and not overusing starters. His refined management style will suit the Red Sox well in October. Last postseason’s series between the Red Sox and Indians showed how Terry Francona’s effective use of Andrew Miller ­­— the Indians’ best reliever ­— was able to squash late inning threats from the Red Sox. Likewise, if Farrell uses pieces like Kelly, Reed and Kimbrel strategically, the Red Sox will be well suited to hold leads in meaningful games.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is much uncertainty surrounding these Red Sox, but the pitching has been consistent and effective. Despite scandal, controversy and under-performing offensive pieces, the team has still managed to secure breathing room from the second-place Yankees. The Red Sox have many tools in their pitching arsenal for September and October; it will be up to John Farrell to decide whom to use at which points, as those moves will have important repercussions for the 2017 Red Sox’ playoff chances.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The women’s soccer team bounced back from a pair of losses last week with a 2-1 victory over Lafayette College at Stevenson-Pincince Field Sunday. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Celia Story ’19 and Mikela Waldman ’18 scored a goal each, fueling Bruno (4-2) to victory. Story put the Bears on the board in the eighth minute, netting a cross from Waldman at the right post.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We were doing well getting wide — we had some success with Mikela getting some crosses in,” Story said. “We were just aggressive to the ball. We just wanted to win the ball, and that gave us some energy up top.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Waldman widened the lead in the 53rd minute, redirecting a cross inside the box from Jennifer Caruso ’19 past the goalkeeper. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A one-on-one goal from Alexa Buffa brought the game closer in the 77th minute, but Bruno held onto the lead until the final whistle.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown dominated offensively, taking 21 shots for Lafayette’s eight. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“You saw a lot more creativity in the attacking third today,” said Head Coach Kia McNeill. “There (are) not a lot of schools that are generating opportunities like that. We got a lot of our attacking players confident on the ball (and) got them a lot of minutes in the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Veteran goalkeeper Christine Etzel ’19 made her sixth appearance of the season, blocking one shot.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With Ivy League play looming, McNeill emphasized the importance of capitalizing on offensive plays and building confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We got a lot of chances on goal, now we’ve got to put them away,” McNeill said. “You get confident through scoring goals and having strong opportunities in front of the net, and … solidifying things in the back third as well. We can’t be giving up easy goals in the Ivy League, so we’ve just got to continue to tighten things up that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will face conference rival Dartmouth to open league play at home Sept. 24. Since the beginning of its season in August, the team has become more comfortable playing with one another, McNeill said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s amazing how well the freshmen have come in and kind of integrated themselves and made an impact into our lineup here,” McNeill said. “You’re starting to see the chemistry come together between a lot of them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When you come in, you have freshmen you haven’t played with — we get started right away,” Story said. “We have some great freshmen, and everyone on the team really likes hanging out and playing together. The more time we get to play together, the better we get.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno visits Massachusetts Thursday before hosting Central Connecticut State Sunday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">The men’s soccer team’s three-game winning streak continued as Brown (3-0) defeated Holy Cross 2-1 in overtime Sunday evening. Goals from Quinn English ’18 and Toby Howell ’19 sealed the Bears’ third victory, which followed a 2-0 win over Quinnipiac Friday night. For the past three seasons, Bruno has opened up 3-0, though the results of the remaining 14 games have been mixed. This year, the team hopes the rest of its season will follow suit. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We went 3-0 last season and then went 5-8, so it’s about maintaining that consistency. 3-0 is a great start, but it’s three out of 17,” English said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the Bears outshot the Crusaders (1-1-1) five to four in the first half, missed opportunities plagued Bruno’s offense. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Holy Cross got on the board first. In the 11th minute, a defensive breakdown by Bruno resulted in a Crusader goal that was last touched by a Brown player. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We started off fine. We were doing well, and then we scored on ourselves,” said Head Coach Patrick Laughlin. “We went into a funk a little bit and weren’t playing as well.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But it would be the only goal for Holy Cross. Multiple crucial stops by goalkeeper Joey Cipicchio ’18 kept the Crusaders at bay, and the Bears entered halftime with just a one-goal deficit. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In the locker room, we got together and decided we weren’t going to go 1-0,” English said. “Our energy took over in the second half.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The newfound intensity was evident as Brown retook the field for the final forty-five minutes of play, displaying better possession and working their offense well. English’s first goal of the season evened the score at 1-1 in the 71st minute, and two big saves by Cipicchio forced overtime. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Five minutes into overtime play, Howell drove a header into the Holy Cross net off a long cross from English to secure the win.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The assist I feel better about, actually, because it was the game winner,” English said. “It’s also nice to get someone else a goal. It’s better for me to get an assist than a goal.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will travel to Oklahoma and Texas to play Tulsa and Southern Methodist University, respectively, next Friday and Sunday before returning home to play in-state rival University of Rhode Island Sept. 23.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Football open season at home Saturday against Bryant</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">It’s been 300 days since the football team finished the 2016 season at Brown Stadium. Saturday, it will return to the gridiron to face off against in-state rival Bryant University. The Bears have won two of the last three against Bryant (1-1), but the Bulldogs have an advantage in starting their season two weeks earlier. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The unknown is that we have to play a team with two games under their belt that probably know what they are and who they are and have been able to make corrections,” said Head Coach Phil Estes P’18. “That’s where most teams make the most improvements — after the second game. We’re not going to know that … I’m more worried about our team and how we execute than I am about our opponent.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite all the uncertainty surrounding the opening game, one thing is clear: The Bears are hungry for a win and have high expectations for 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I really want to go out there and just destroy this team,” said co-captain Isaiah Thompkins ’19. “We want to go 10-0 and win a championship. We have a lot of guys coming back who are really passionate about football, so I’m optimistic about this season.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After finishing last season fourth in the league with a 4-6 record, Bruno will have a chance to start fresh and rise from the ashes, literally. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was a disappointment,” Estes said. “There were games that we could’ve won that we let go, and I don’t think we played completely up to our capabilities. But that’s over with. We dealt with it. We had a ceremony, and we burned that. We burned the media guide. We burned everything. We do it every year, so we can get rid of last year and move on.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since leaving the 2016 season behind, the Bears have reshaped themselves, implementing a dry season and adopting the team motto, “Be Elite.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This year, our team is all in,” said co-captain Richard “Dewey” Jarvis ’17.5. “Everyone is committing to the team and committing to the season. I like our resilience. After the Yale scrimmage — it wasn’t a great scrimmage for us — our team’s just bounced back with so much energy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nicholas Duncan ’19 is set to lead the Bears’ up-tempo spread offense as the starting quarterback. He’ll be supported by running back David Moodie ’19, whose impact on the field was<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>cut short by injuries last season. On the defensive side, veteran standouts like Terrell Smith ’18, Connor Coughlin ’18 and Jarvis ­— who led the league in tackles for loss in 2016­­ — will ensure opponents don’t venture too close to the redzone. Numerous unique and complex defensive schemes will also prove troublesome for opposing offenses. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One offense Bruno hopes to stop short is Harvard. The Crimson bested the Bears by just ten points a year ago, but Thompkins is anticipating a hard-fought game in Cambridge Sept. 23. And in November, Brown will return to the city for the most highly anticipated matchup of its season against Dartmouth at Fenway Park, the home of the Boston Red Sox, which holds over 37,000 spectators.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It gives me chills just being able to play on that field,” Thompkins said. “It’s legendary.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though Brown Stadium does not have a Green Monster, the Bear Den, a new student section located in front of the video scoreboard, will feature free t-shirts, free food and a live DJ.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“I want to get into the endzone and have a crowd there that’s excited about having some fun and being into the game,” Estes said. “If we can get as many people as possible there, I’m all for it. I’d love to make the Bear Den a den of angry bears.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A free shuttle to the stadium will be running Saturday, and students have access to all home games with their Brown ID. Kickoff for Saturday’s game is set for 12:30 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Breaking down the impending MLB playoff stretch</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the Major League Baseball season enters its last month of regular season play, the landscape of the league is clear. There are a few contenders at the top, some teams scrapping for wild card spots in the middle and more awful teams playing the year out with only pride at stake. While arguing the merits of teams such as the San Francisco Giants or Philadelphia Phillies can be entertaining, far more important is the question of which contender will actually take home the championship. I have decided to include in that conversation the following teams: Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros, Washington Nationals, Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers. While the Arizona Diamondbacks, St. Louis Cardinals, Colorado Rockies and Minnesota Twins all may have a shot at the crown, these teams seem destined to battle in wild card games.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Beginning in the American League East, we have the two historical favorites contending for the lead divisional spot once again: Boston and New York. The Red Sox have not come together as smoothly as expected this season, and several key players — outfielder Mookie Betts, shortstop Xander Bogaerts and designated hitter Hanley Ramirez — have significantly underperformed. Pitcher Chris Sale has been fantastic for the majority of the season, but as currently constituted, the Red Sox do not have a great chance at winning the World Series.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Yankees may be 3.5 games behind the Red Sox, but they are better built for a lengthy playoff run than Boston so long as the Yankees win the division and avoid the wild card game. Outfielder Aaron Judge has drawn most of the headlines for his first-half dominance and second-half collapse, but New York’s supporting cast is what really stands out. Catcher Gary Sanchez is a star, and players such as shortstop Didi Gregorius, second baseman Starlin Castro and outfielder Brett Gardner protect him in the lineup. The midseason addition of Sonny Gray bolstered a starting rotation already filled with talent. Make no mistake, the Yankees are back and dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Houston Astros started the year on fire but have since cooled off. Their .826 team OPS is the best in baseball by a wide margin, propped up by MVP candidate second baseman Jose Altuve, shortstop Carlos Correa and outfielder George Springer. But pitching will be a major concern for Houston in the postseason. The staff ranks 12th in the league with a 4.26 ERA, a mark that pales in comparison to the other contenders. Justin Verlander, recently acquired from the Detroit Tigers, and Dallas Keuchel lead the rotation, but Houston’s bullpen is shaky at best. In postseason games — where scoring is decreased due to the quality of starting pitching — late-inning bullpen work is all the more important. It will be hard for the Astros to advance far in the postseason with their relief pitching’s penchant for blowing games.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Even though there are genuine threats in the American League, the Cleveland Indians are the most impressive squad in the league by far. With a current 21-game winning streak as of Wednesday night, the Indians boast a roster of star power that crosses all facets of the game. Pitcher Corey Kluber might be the best in baseball, with a ridiculous 2.44 ERA and 0.87 WHIP in the year of the home run. The lineup is loaded from top to bottom: third baseman Jose Ramirez, shortstop Francisco Lindor, first baseman Carlos Santana, designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion, outfielder Jay Bruce — the list of names goes on and on. Looking at the American League as of now, it would be an upset if the Indians were not back in the World Series again.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Heading over to the National League, it is the same old story for the Washington Nationals. They have put together another dominant regular season, but Washington has been unable to carry that success over to the playoffs in the past few years. There is little reason to believe, especially with outfielder Bryce Harper’s knee injury, that this year will be any different. Second baseman Daniel Murphy, third baseman Anthony Rendon and first baseman Ryan Zimmerman will continue to try to make up for Harper’s absence. Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Gio Gonzalez form baseball’s best 1-2-3 pitching punch, creating a postseason rotation no one wants to face. But it is hard to trust this team after so many years of playoff failures. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Chicago Cubs may have won the World Series last season, but they have not shown enough this year to be considered favorites by any stretch of the imagination. The team started slowly out of the gates and only got hot after the All-Star break. First baseman Anthony Rizzo and third baseman Kris Bryant remain the club’s best players, and catcher Willson Contreras has enjoyed a breakout season, but several key members of the team have underperformed. Outfielder Kyle Schwarber was even sent down to the minors for a stretch to find his swing again. His batting average has hovered around the Mendoza line all year. Second baseman and World Series MVP Ben Zobrist and pitchers Jon Lester and John Lackey have struggled as well. Though the Cubs obviously have the talent to win it all, they will enter the postseason as underdogs. But in a year when the Los Angeles Dodgers were a heavy favorite for the vast majority of the season and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>then lost 16 out of 17 recent games, it is hard to know who the real favorites are. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though it is easy to reject the Dodgers’ chances after such an awful stretch, it is important to keep in mind the talent Los Angeles still possesses. First baseman Cody Bellinger, third baseman Justin Turner and shortstop Corey Seager make up the heart of a dangerous lineup. Pitchers Clayton Kershaw, Alex Wood and Rich Hill form a fearsome starting rotation. If Yu Darvish can return to his usual performance, that rotation becomes even stronger. Closer Kenley Jansen’s numbers — a 1.29 ERA and 0.75 WHIP — speak for themselves. Los Angeles may not be one of the best teams in the history of baseball, but they can still win a World Series. One would be wise not to bet against the Dodgers come October. They are too good to continue playing at their current level.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The men’s soccer team extended its winning streak to three after a 2-1 victory over Holy Cross in overtime Sunday. Toby Howell ’19 netted the golden goal in the 96th minute, keeping the Bears undefeated ahead of their trip to Texas to play Tulsa and Southern Methodist University this weekend. Howell earned Brown Student-Athlete of the Week honors and was named Ivy League Player of the Week for his achievements, which included an assist against Quinnipiac Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Howell’s overtime game-winning header was his first goal for the Bears. He transferred from Marquette University this year after starting sixteen games and recording eight points during his two seasons as a forward with the Golden Eagles. Howell was also a Big East All-Academic selection in his rookie year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For his game-winner against Holy Cross and strong start in his first season with the Bears, Howell has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: You scored the game-winner against Holy Cross in overtime last weekend. What was that game like for you?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Howell: For the most part it was pretty frustrating up until that point. But what made the goal so special was that we didn’t play our best, but we were still able to pull a result out of it. I was of course really excited when I scored, and I was just really happy that we could win even when we didn’t play our best.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How has the transition from Marquette to Brown been?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s been awesome, I’m really excited to be here. I love all the guys on my team and the coaches have been great. I felt so welcomed from the minute I got here, and all my nervousness and fears went away the moment I set foot on campus because I feel like this is the right place for me to be.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What do you like most about Brown so far?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I love all my teammates, so I guess just the people here — the people here are all just so interesting and diverse and I just feel like they’ve been so welcoming to me.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What were your expectations going into this season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I definitely had high expectations because as soon as I got to training, I realized that we had a lot of very good players. Personally, I just wanted to contribute to the team as much as possible. So I would say that our expectations were pretty high going in, and right now we’ve been able to live up to those expectations, but we’ve got to keep it going.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>When did you start playing soccer?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Probably since I could start to walk. I was at the YMCA kicking balls, so from the minute I started walking.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Did you play any other sports growing up?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I play a lot of sports. I played a little tennis, I ran cross country and track in high school, and I play a lot of golf now, but not so much seriously anymore. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have a favorite game day breakfast or meal?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Probably my favorite breakfast right now is a breakfast sandwich from Bagel Gourmet, that’s what I’ve started getting addicted to.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have any pregame rituals or things you do to get in the zone? Are you superstitious at all?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not so much superstitious, but I’ve been growing my hair out for a while and I said that I’m growing it out until we lose. So hopefully I end the season with a really long mane of hair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you like to listen to music when you work out? What do you like to listen to?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I’m a big Kanye West guy — I love his new album Life of Pablo so I listen to that a lot. Basically any Kanye West gets me going.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>The team has made a strong start to its 2017 campaign. What are your individual aims for the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My goal is always to score goals but also play well on a consistent basis — not play well in these beginning games, but play well in the Ivy League games, the ones that matter the most. I guess it’s just to play at a high level for the whole season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears play Tulsa and Southern Methodist University Friday and Sunday, respectively. The team will return home to face the University of Rhode Island at Stevenson-Pincince Field September 23.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following a pair of victories over Lafayette and Massachusetts last week, the women’s soccer team extended its winning streak to three with a 2-1 win over Central Connecticut State (3-5-0) at Stevenson-Pincince Field Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Goals from Celia Story ’19 and Star White ’21 powered Bruno (6-2-0) to victory, erasing an early, one-goal lead for the Blue Devils.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We came back from a deficit and then were able to put another goal away,” said Head Coach Kia McNeill. “Our team has a lot of resilience and you saw that tonight. That just says a lot about our leadership on the team and our attacking personalities, who were able to dig us out of that hole.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">White scored the game-winning goal in the 55th minute, heading in a cross from Story on the right side.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In the first half, we had a lot of opportunities on goal, so I knew we were going to come back and score some more,” White said. “When Celia had that ball, I backed up and I just kind of headed it in —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it happened so fast. We just had the willpower and said we were going to win, so we brought it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Story tied the game in the 24th minute, sending the ball into the left corner of the goal off a cross from Mikela Waldman ’18. Waldman recorded two assists in the contest.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Blue Devils took an early lead in the 11th minute, when Yo Tachibana followed up an initial block with a shot past Brown goalkeeper Christine Etzel ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We came out in a 3-5-2, which is a little bit more of an aggressive offensive formation,” McNeill said. “Any time you play that, you’re a little bit vulnerable in the back.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Etzel made four saves for her sixth season victory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With Ivy League play looming, McNeill emphasized the importance of maximizing both the team’s defensive strength and offensive output.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We want to solidify things on the defensive side, but we want to continue to get better offensively as well — you can’t win games unless you score goals,” McNeill said. “Getting more efficient (and) more aggressive in front of the goal is really going to be a strength of this team going forward.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mentally, the Bears are well-poised to open conference play against Dartmouth at home Sunday. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We all believe in each other, we had a lot of players playing in different positions tonight and everybody’s very confident,” McNeill said. “That’s definitely where we want to be heading into Ivy League play.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We can just become even more connected and tighten it as a group because we’re still getting used to how one person plays versus the other,” White said. “We’ve been constantly building and I don’t think we’ve reached our peak yet, so I think this was a good game to put our confidence up as a team.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will host Sacred Heart Wednesday before facing Dartmouth at home Sunday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Starting quarterback Nicholas Duncan ’19 had a strong showing in the football team’s home opener, accounting for three of the Bears’ (1-0) four touchdowns in a 28-23 victory over Bryant University Saturday. Rookie Scott Boylan ’21 woke up the Bear Den with a 95-yard kickoff return for the Bears’ first touchdown. Though penalties plagued Bruno’s offensive efforts, big plays on defense by co-captains Richard “Dewey” Jarvis ’17.5 and Isaiah Thompkins ’19 kept the Bulldogs under control.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s huge to start off with a win,” Jarvis said. “Everyone’s feeling good about it. We’re going to clean up all the mistakes we made … It’s just nice entering the season on a high.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown came out of the gates flying as Jarvis sacked Price Wilson for an eight-yard loss on the first play of the game. After swapping punts, the veteran defensive end recorded an identical sack on the Bulldogs’ second offensive possession. Later in the series, Bryant escaped a sticky 3rd-and-16 after a costly penalty negated an interception by Sebastian Dovi ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno stopped the Bulldogs before they could reach the end zone, forcing Bryant to kick a field goal for the first score of the game. Boylan responded instantly, scoring on his first collegiate touch on the ensuing kickoff. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bryant had success in the passing game early, outgaining Brown 76 yards to 10 in the first quarter. But Duncan eventually found his rhythm in his first start, finding a reliable target in Jaelon Blandburg ’20. After a Bryant field goal went wide right early in the second, Duncan connected with Blandburg for a 24-yard gain. A six-yard completion to Livingstone Harriott ’20 moved the Bears to midfield. On the next play, Duncan rushed into the endzone untouched for his first score, putting Brown up 14-3.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bulldogs secured a touchdown of their own to close out the second quarter, and the teams headed to the locker room with Brown leading 14-10.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears started off the second half with a trick play. A fake fourth down punt that featured a direct snap to Thompkins fooled Bryant, and the junior rushed for 17 to pick up a new set of downs. The Bears burst into the redzone after Duncan found Harriott for a 21-yard gain. Duncan held onto the ball for his second rushing touchdown, putting Brown up 21-10 after the extra point.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bryant answered with a score of its own. But in the Bulldogs’ next series, Brown’s defense forced and recovered a fumble, resulting in Duncan connecting with Isaac Whitney ’18 for a touchdown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the Bears’ defense started feeling the heat late in the fourth quarter as Bryant converted mu</span>ltiple fourth downs.</p>
<p class="p2">“I don’t think I’ve ever sweat this much before in-season,” Jarvis said. “Usually it’s not this humid, and a lot of guys were catching cramps all throughout the game … Everyone bore down and kind of dug through it. It was a huge test of resilience, and everyone stepped up.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bulldogs managed one final touchdown but failed a two-point conversion, leaving the score at 28-23. Brown’s defense got a second wind and cut Bryant’s last offensive drive short with a sack by Jarvis and a game-ending interception by Thompkins.</p>
<p class="p2">“Knowing you got that win under your belt, you have a little bit of swagger and a little bit of confidence going into the next game,” Jarvis said.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears travel to Harvard to open conference play Saturday at noon, and Head Coach Phil Estes P’18 has clear expectations: “win.”</p>
<p class="p2">“We haven’t had a win in a long time ag<span class="s1">ainst Harvard,” Estes said. “We had a lot of penalties called against us, so we have to clean that up. If we can do that, then we’re going to have a game.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein ’20: Is the NFL in trouble?</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/21/klein-20-nfl-trouble/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NFL is back, and that is cause for celebration among sports fans. Yet something was not quite right in the opening games of the season. TV ratings dropped, for one thing. According to CNN, over the first two weeks, Monday Night Football was down 5 percent and Sunday afternoon games on Fox and CBS dropped 11 percent and 19 percent, respectively. The quality of play and the recent hurricanes have been cited as reasons for the ratings dip, but the drop has carried over from last year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the whole, last year’s NFL regular season ratings were down 9 percent and playoff ratings 6 percent. The election cycle and the continuing “cord-cutting” phenomenon were blamed. But at what point is it time to dig deeper instead of passing off lowered viewership as a temporary trend?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Quality of play is a valid reason, as anyone who watched last Thursday’s 13-9 snooze between the Houston Texans and Cincinnati Bengals knows well. The issue was a hot topic last year also, but the problem appears to have worsened. After two weeks, it has become apparent that there are just five to seven teams with a legitimate shot to take home the title. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even worse is the fact that almost half of the league is simply horrendous. Any person who takes a peek at the NFL standings can find two bad teams in almost every division. A glance at the AFC, for example, reveals the Bills, Jets, Browns, Bengals, Texans, Colts and Chargers. Yikes! Who wants to watch any game between two of those teams, except for their very dedicated fan bases?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And the problem could be here to stay for years to come, just like a more sinister issue: concussions. While concussions have been highlighted in the news for years, the actual level of play has not been affected. Still, early retirement has become more prominent. Offensive lineman John Urschel left the NFL this year, linebacker A.J. Tarpley last year and talented linebacker Chris Borland the year before that.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The harsher effects, however, will be felt as the next generation of players rises through the ranks. More and more parents are refusing to let their children play football, as cases of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, CTE for short, pervade retired NFL athletes — and even some college and high school football players. CTE, commonly called “punch-drunk” syndrome among the boxing community, is caused by repeated blows to the head, as happens over and over in football.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The talent pool has not been hurt so far, but what about a couple of decades from now? It certainly will not help the quality of play issue. A smaller collection of talent makes it easier for a handful of players to dominate. Parity could be completely wrecked ­—<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>not to mention the actual gameplay. Will the NFL be as popular with more Josh McCowns and other New York Jets-level players? The most talented athletes would gravitate more toward safer sports such as basketball or soccer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, the NFL may not be worrying about the game’s future since the league office keeps bungling the present. Commissioner Roger Goodell continues to mess up every key decision, all while being paid ridiculous sums of money. Deflategate, obviously, made national headlines, but the subject has been talked about ad nauseam, so let’s move on. Far more troubling is the NFL’s uneven pattern of punishment. Compare Ray Rice’s infamous 2014 two-game suspension after assaulting his wife on video with Darren Waller’s 2017 one-year suspension for smoking marijuana. It is not a pretty picture. The NFL, after facing the public’s criticism for its incredibly weak stance towards Rice, has cracked down on everything else.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Waller is not alone. He was the fourth player within a year to be suspended for that long due to a weed-related violation of the league’s substance abuse policy. With all the powerful painkillers that have been plunged into players’ bodies before games, leading many on the path to addiction, weed should be low on the list of NFL drug-related concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The NFL is still America’s top sport. But problem after problem keeps popping up and, eventually, a breaking point will come. When that happens is anyone’s guess, though with the NBA gaining in popularity, the NFL could face some real competition for its gold medal position in 20 years or so. The MLB has an inability to connect to younger audiences, but the league has been around since 1903 and will not be going anywhere for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But what fate lies in store for football? Boxing, another brutal, head-trauma inducing affair, was perhaps America’s most popular sport in the early 20th century. But now it lies on the fringes, far away from any sort of competition with the “Big 4.” If history is any indication, I do not feel so sure about what the NFL’s place in the sports world will be in 2117.</span></p>

		<title>Duncan ’20 leads football to victory in home opener Saturday</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Nicholas Duncan ’20 made the most of his first collegiate start, rushing for two touchdowns and throwing for a third to secure the victory over Bryant in the football team’s season opener last Saturday. The dual-threat quarterback completed 14 of 27 passes and carried the ball 10 times. Duncan lead Brown (1-0) in passing and rushing with 152 and 73 yards, respectively.</p>
<p class="p2">For his performance in the season opener, Duncan has been named The Herald’s athlete of the week.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Herald: How did you get into football? </b></p>
<p class="p2">Duncan: I started playing in first grade. My dad played in college, so he introduced me to the game, and I’ve been playing ever since.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p2">It was my first offer. It was either commit here or just be a regular student somewhere else.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What’s it like to be the starting QB?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I enjoy being part of the team and enjoy playing, so I can’t complain at all.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How did it feel to score three touchdowns in your first collegiate start?</b></p>
<p class="p2">It’s a team effort. It’s a bunch of the guys making plays. Anyone could’ve scored those three touchdowns. We were just put in a good position by the coaches and the players.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Was the 50-yard touchdown the result of a great play call or more of you thinking on your feet?</b></p>
<p class="p2">It was a draw play, and we just got lucky that it was a great play call. They brought on a lot of blitz with man coverage behind, and I was just able to split the backers and score on that play. Once I missed the linebacker, and it was all green, I thought I could make it.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Are you making any changes to your game for Harvard?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Our game plan changes every week. I’ve got to complete a little more passes this week, be more accurate and stay calm and collected in the pocket.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What’s on your pregame playlist?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Whatever they play in the locker room. Usually there’s a few guys who have the playlist, so whatever they like.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Have you ever wanted to play another position besides quarterback?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Not really. I love the position. I love having the ball in my hand, so it fits well.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Is there another player you try to model your game or playing style after?</b></p>
<p class="p2">There’s a lot of good athletes right now like (Oklahoma’s) Baker Mayfield and (Trace) McSorely at Penn State. They both have the dual-threat capability and are great in the pocket too. Those are players who I like to watch.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>If you could play any other sport, what would it be and why?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I played tennis in high school, so I’m big into tennis. I love it. I love the game.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>This interview has been edited for clarity and length.</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">Following the men’s soccer team’s first loss of the season to Southern Methodist University last Sunday, Brown (4-1-1) returned home to write the next chapter of their intrastate rivalry with the University of Rhode Island Saturday. Bruno was unable to get back to its winning ways, as the Rams (3-2-2) managed to battle the Bears to a scoreless draw.</p>
<p class="p4">“We did really well defensively,” said co-captain James Myall ’18. “We were pretty strong in the back, especially on set pieces.”</p>
<p class="p4">Both URI and Brown started fast, as the offenses threatened with several corner kicks, shots barely high and wide and passes that were inches off the mark. The first half demonstrated the physicality of both teams; the Bears and Rams both earned early yellow cards and combined for 17 first-half fouls.</p>
<p class="p4">The most notable first-half scoring chance for Bruno came when Jack Hagstrom ’19 was able to soar above the defense on a corner kick for a header that was mere inches wide of the net.</p>
<p class="p4">As the second half began, the Rams came out with urgency, creating a quick shot from the top of the goal box that required a diving save from Brown goalie Joey Cipicchio ’18, sending the shot rolling barely outside of the goal post.</p>
<p class="p4">But as the second half continued, the Bears were able to settle in and respond offensively. Nico Lozada ’18 started to breathe life into the Bears’ offense with the first two shots on goal of the game in the 56th and 58th minutes.</p>
<p class="p4">The tension of the rivalry boiled over in the second half, as the referees needed to stop the game to separate players from each team at midfield.</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears came excruciatingly close to breaking the ice in the final five minutes of regulation. Quinn English ’18 was able to get behind the Rams’ defense twice but was unable to convert on the scoring opportunities.</p>
<p class="p4">“We could be a little better in the final third,” Myall said. “We obviously had quite a few chances up there. Just putting the ball in the net — that’s something we need to do better.”</p>
<p class="p4">After 90 minutes of hard-fought soccer, this Ocean State rivalry went to overtime for the second year in a row. Regulation was remarkably even, as the Bears led the Rams in shots 10-9 and both sides were knotted with seven corner kicks each.</p>
<p class="p4">The first overtime featured numerous opportunities for both teams, but neither squad was able to find the game-winning goal. Brown’s strong defense was aided in part by another diving save in the 99th minute from Cipicchio off of a corner kick.</p>
<p class="p4">“We just couldn’t get around them,” said co-captain Louis Zingas ’18. “They were solid in the back, winning 50/50s. They just did a really good job of shutting us down.”</p>
<p class="p4">In the second overtime,the fatigue of playing a 100-minute game seemed to get the best of both squads. There were no major offensive opportunities as the clock wound down on a tough, physical game.</p>
<p class="p4">“It showed we could grind out good results,” Zingas said. “It’s hard against a team like (URI), who is super physical. But we matched them, intensity- and effort-wise.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears will return to the pitch Tuesday for a matchup against Boston University before beginning Ivy League play on the road Saturday against Columbia at 1:00 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The Brown men’s cross country team tested themselves against national, regional and conference-caliber competition at the Coast-to-Coast Battle in Beantown Friday, hosted by Boston College at Franklin Park.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Though the weather was wet and cheerless, the outcome of the meet was sunny for Brown. In its strongest showing of the season, Bruno tallied 117 points to place fourth out of 18 teams. Only nationally ranked programs outpaced Brown: No. 3 Syracuse, No. 27 Illinois and No. 21 Indiana, which finished in that order. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Brown handily defeated cross-town rival Providence College, which finished seventh. It was a major coup for the Bears, marking the first time in five years that Brown has triumphed over the Friars. Brown also enjoyed victories over Ivy League foes Dartmouth and Harvard, who finished ninth and 11th, respectively. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Co-captain Matthew Mahoney ’18 said the team was pleased with the result. “Going into the meet, we were expecting to beat Harvard and Dartmouth fairly easily. We weren’t really sure about Providence … they’ve got a great team and a great coach. So that was pretty exciting.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mahoney scalped a few athletes in the late stages of the race to lead his team home with an eighth place finish. Mahoney covered the eight-kilometer course in 24 minutes, 28 seconds — just 15 seconds slower than the individual winner, Jesse Reiser of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Head Coach Tim Springfield’s plan had been for Mahoney to run alongside co-captain Martin Martinez ’18 in the lead pack, keeping stride with the frontrunners for as long as possible. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“When we went through 5K, some of the Syracuse and Illinois guys started dropping the pace a little bit,” Mahoney said. “My last two miles were my fastest miles — I was able to pass three or four guys. Martin faded a bit, but still finished pretty strong.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Brown’s next three runners crossed the line in a cluster: Martinez — in his first major cross country race since undergoing surgery over a year ago — finished 22nd in 24:47; Cameron Daly ’20, 23rd in 24:50; and Michael Wyman ’18, 25th in 24:56. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The captains were excited about the strong showing by Wyman — a middle-distance specialist on the track — as this was his first 8-km cross-country race in nearly three years. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The training (Wyman) has done the past few years has been more 800 meter to mile-oriented,” Mahoney said. “He got his mileage up this summer and this fall. He’s going to play a big role on the team going forward.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A gap in Brown’s pack followed Wyman. Precious seconds ticked away as the squad waited for its crucial fifth man to finish; all the while, runners from other teams were pouring into the finishing chute. Eventually, Gabe Altopp ’20 staunched the bleeding for the Bears, finalizing Brown’s score by finishing in 43rd place. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The Bears competed without their usual number three man, senior Andrew Foerder ’18, who was absent due to academic commitments. Had Foerder finished near Martinez and Daly, as he has in past meets this season, Brown would have scored roughly 15 fewer points and leapfrogged Indiana in the standings. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Martinez emphasized the importance of senior leadership in regards to the improvement that the team has shown this year. “We have a lot of upperclassmen who have been injured in the past, who’ve finally been able to put the pieces together and figure out what’s right for them in terms of training and racing,” he said. “They know this is their last year, and they’re putting all their cards on the table.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Bears’ postseason prospects are bright. In the latest edition of the U.S. Track &amp; Field and Cross Country Coaches Association Division I NCAA Coaches’ Regional Rankings, Brown is ranked sixth in the Northeast, while Providence is ranked fourth. Given the Friars’ defeat at the hands of Bruno, it is reasonable to assume that this order will reverse in the poll’s next edition. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Brown has not finished as high as fourth place at the NCAA Northeast Regional since 2007. Finishing fourth or better this year could potentially earn the Bears their first ticket to NCAA Nationals since 1996. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Bears will lace up their spikes again Oct. 13, when the team hosts its annual home meet, the Rothenberg Cross Country Invitational, at Goddard Memorial State Park in Warwick. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following a victory over Sacred Heart Wednesday, the women’s soccer team extended its winning streak to five with a 1-0 overtime win over Dartmouth (4-5, 0-1 Ivy) at Stevenson-Pincince Field Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Star White ’21 scored the golden goal — her fourth of the season — in the 92nd minute. White controlled a looping cross from Celia Story ’19 in the left side of the box before launching a shot to the right corner of the net.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The whole game we were dominating — you could tell we were the leaders of the game in terms of possession, and we had a bunch of chances on goal,” White said. “I knew it was coming, and we deserved a win.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears (8-2, 1-0) applied consistent offensive pressure throughout, outshooting the Big Green 23-6.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve got to finish our opportunities when they come, and there were a couple of opportunities earlier in the game where I felt we rushed our shot a little bit,” said Head Coach Kia McNeill. “What you saw out of Star at the end (was) a little bit more composure.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A strong defensive showing enabled Bruno to shut the Big Green down and compensate for the drawbacks of the 3-5-2 formation the Bears recently adopted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Playing a 3-5-2 — it leaves you a little bit more vulnerable in the back, so there was a lot that we wanted to clean up this week,” McNeill said. “Our defenders really implemented the game plan well and executed everything that we wanted them to do tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Goalkeeper Christine Etzel ’19 made two saves — including a leaping catch off a header in the second half — for her second shutout of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the Bears delve deeper into conference play, they seek to develop greater fluidity on the field and conviction in the final third.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We need to continue to find chemistry up top in terms of finishing the ball, knowing where to cross it, where your runs are and just finishing off the game early,” White said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Bruno’s recent wins are a major source of optimism, the team remains diligent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re confident, but we’re not complacent, and we’re still hungry to keep getting after the next one,” McNeill said. “Right now we’re just focused on getting everybody’s bodies rejuvenated and ready for next weekend.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears continue Ivy League play at Columbia Saturday before hosting Princeton Oct. 7.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">It’s rare that the scoreboard at a football game displays less than three points. But as Brown battled against Harvard for the 117th time Saturday, it played under a brightly lit two — the only points the Bears (1-1, 0-1 Ivy) managed until the final quarter. A last-minute four-touchdown effort led by quarterback Thomas “TJ” Linta ’18 wasn’t enough for Bruno to overcome the Crimson (1-1, 1-0 Ivy) as Brown fell 45-28.</p>
<p class="p4">“We really had to execute on offense and we just weren’t getting it going in the first half,” Linta said. “In the third and fourth quarters, we started to pick it up on offense as a whole. We started to execute, and we put some points on the board.”</p>
<p class="p4">Harvard posted seven on the scoreboard midway through the first quarter, but co-captain Richard “Dewey” Jarvis ’17.5 helped the Bears respond by sneaking into the backfield for a safety. But the momentum didn’t stay on Bruno’s side for long, as starting quarterback Nicholas Duncan ’19 threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown on the following offensive drive.</p>
<p class="p4">Turnovers and poor execution continued to plague Brown’s offense for the remainder of the first half and Harvard found the endzone for a third time to take a 21-2 lead going into the locker room.</p>
<p class="p4">“All the guys at halftime were like, ‘We’ve got to pick it up. We’re not playing how we are supposed to play,’” Linta said. “We scored two points in the first half, and that’s definitely not acceptable. …We’ve been here before. We’ve been in these situations. Every drive is like it’s 0-0 and every drive you’ve got to go out there with the will to score.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Crimson scored 17 unanswered points in the third quarter, prompting the Brown coaching staff to substitute out Duncan for Linta. Though this was the first time Linta saw action in the pocket this season, the senior racked up 253 passing yards on 20 completions and three touchdowns. Bruno’s first TD came on a 15-yard strike to Demitri Jackson ’20 after a forced fumble by Kenari Drayton ’19. Harvard responded with a touchdown of its own, bringing the score to 45-9 with six minutes remaining.</p>
<p class="p4">But Linta had an answer, connecting with Jaelon Blandburg ’20 for his second passing score of the night. Bruno’s next offensive series ended in Linta keeping the ball for a four-yard scamper into the endzone. A successful onside kick set up the Bears for their final score as Linta hit Scott Boylan ’21 for the rookie’s first receiving TD with 34 seconds left in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="p4">With the score 45-28, another onside kick gave Brown its final opportunity to chip away at Harvard’s lead. But incomplete passes spelled the end of Bruno’s offensive resurgence.</p>
<p class="p4">Despite losing their first conference game of the season, the Bears still have their eyes on an Ivy crown.</p>
<p class="p4">“We have the mindset of going and winning every game,” Linta said. “If we win every game, we should be able to still win the title. … Today, we had a tough game, but we’ve just got to put it behind us. What happened happened, and we’re on to next week.”</p>
<p class="p4">Next week brings in-state rival University of Rhode Island to Brown Stadium for the 102nd Governor’s Cup. After giving away the Cup to the Rams (1-3) last season, the Bears look to reclaim the trophy, but the victory won’t come easily as Rhody’s sole win came against Harvard last week. Kickoff is set for Saturday at 7 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3">For Head Coach Diane Short, Friday’s volleyball match against Princeton isn’t just a chance for the Bears to move up in the Ivy League rankings, it’s “an evening of hope.” For the sixth year, Brown is hosting a “Spike ALS Match” to raise awareness about the disease. The fundraising event has added significance for Short, as she lost her mother to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 12 years ago while two of her siblings currently have the disease.</p>
<p class="p4">At the time Short’s mother passed away, there was no cure for the neurodegenerative disease. But as advancements in research have continued, and with the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge bringing attention to the cause, Short is optimistic that a breakthrough is on the horizon.</p>
<p class="p4">“I’m very proactive about trying to improve the situation,” Short said. “It’s not only going to help ALS, it’s going to help a lot of the neurological diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s” and multiple sclerosis. For me, it’s even bigger than ALS. Because ALS has hit me personally, I’m a fighter. I want to fight it. I’m very hopeful there will be a cure.”</p>
<p class="p4">The entire volleyball team came together this year in support of Short and her efforts to generate awareness surrounding ALS.</p>
<p class="p4">“This season in particular, our team has really rallied around this cause,” said co-captain Melissa Cairo ’18. Short “means a lot to us. We’ve learned a lot about the disease through her and through having this game. … She’s so positive all the time and so proactive about it. It reflects on our team a lot.”</p>
<p class="p4">Last season, the team received a visit from Short’s brother, who was a source of inspiration for the student-athletes.</p>
<p class="p4">“It was incredibly powerful,” Cairo said. “He came to a couple of our games, and even though he could hardly move and was talking to us through an iPad, it was so powerful. All the things that he said and his outlook on the entire experience had a profound effect on our entire team.”</p>
<p class="p4">Short has already raised $5,000 of this year’s $6,000 goal, but she doesn’t plan on stopping any time soon.</p>
<p class="p4">“This is not the end of what I’m doing,” she said. “To me, the money is not the biggest deal. The biggest deal is to have something like this to show awareness.”</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno will try to knock off the reigning Ivy League champion Princeton 7 p.m. Friday. Short and her team are looking forward to packing the Pizzitola and ask all fans to wear red. Admission is free and t-shirts will be given to the first 200 students.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following its season opener at the Columbia Invitational in New York Sept. 8, the men’s cross country team traveled to Boston to participate in the Coast-to-Coast Battle in Beantown hosted by Boston College Friday. Bruno finished fourth overall with 117 points, trailing only No. 3 Syracuse, No. 27 Illinois and No. 21 Indiana. Veteran Matt Mahoney ’18 delivered a standout performance, placing eighth individually out of 157 runners with a time of 24 minutes, 28 seconds on the eight-kilometer course. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For Mahoney, the turf at Franklin Park was familiar — he finished fourth in the same event last season. His career with the Bears has been highlighted by a second-place finish<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and personal record time of 24 minites, 23.9 seconds in the 8K at the New England Inter-Collegiate Amateur Athletics Association Championship in 2016. Mahoney took the 3,000-meter crown in the 2015 Brown Springtime Open after competing in the Ivy Championships in his rookie season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For his outstanding performance in Boston, Mahoney has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: You placed highly at the Battle in Beantown last weekend. What was that race like for you?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mahoney: It was a pretty deep race — there were three ranked teams in the race, so my goal going in was just to stay with the top pack. I was kind of expecting the Syracuse guys to hang back for the first three miles or so and then really start picking up pace in the last couple miles and that pretty much happened. I was able to respond to that surge later in the race pretty well and passed a few guys in the last mile to get into the top ten.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What were your expectations going into this season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We have a lot of seniors this year on the team who are running well and who are pretty fit, so the expectations were high coming in. We’re trying to place highly in the Ivy League meet, and we’re also shooting to try to make the (National Collegiate Athletic Association) meet. That’s been a goal and Friday was just a big confidence booster. We were 11 points away from beating Indiana, who was ranked 21st in the country at the time, and we were missing one of the guys in our top five — he had an academic commitment, so without him we were that close. It’s just a pretty big confidence builder, and it reaffirms that the training is going well.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>When did you first get into running?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I didn’t really start getting serious about running probably until ninth or 10th grade. I had done a little bit of running before that but nothing too serious. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Did you play any other sports growing up?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yeah, I played soccer and baseball growing up.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>You have competed in multiple distance events. Do you have a favorite distance to run?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I like cross country races most probably — in college they’re either eight kilometers, which is pretty much five miles, and then the NCAA meets regionally and nationally are 10K. I’d say cross country races are probably my favorite, and, on the track, I’d say my favorite race is the 5K.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have a favorite meet day breakfast or meal?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not really, I know a lot of people have a go-to meal and they eat it a certain amount of time before the race. But I don’t really have that — I try to eat something light and try to not eat like three hours before the meets. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have any pre-race rituals or things you do to get in the zone? Are you superstitious at all?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">No, I’m not superstitious. We do the same thing before every race with the warmup routine. We do the same stretches and the same drills; we always go for a 20-minute warmup run before that, so that’s all the same. But outside of that, I’m not really superstitious. I don’t have any weird quirks or anything else I do before the race.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you like to listen to music when you work out? What do you like to listen to?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the good things about being on a college team is that there are always guys to run with, so I don’t really listen to music that much because (I’m) mostly running with other people.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you feel that you have developed as a runner in your time at Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yeah, I have. I’ve physically matured a lot with the training — three years ago to right now I’m a much better runner. … The mental part, the psychological part of running, I’m a lot tougher. … That’s a big part of running that when you’re only in high school you don’t really realize. (With) these long races, there’s a big mental aspect that you can cultivate and grow, (and) being part of this program I’ve been able to do that. I’ve also run personal bests in pretty much every distance here; I’ve beaten guys that beat me in high school pretty routinely. The race on Friday — Syracuse is the number three ranked team in the country, and they held out their best runner, but I broke up their top five; I beat some of their scores. I wasn’t expecting to be at that level coming out of high school, but it’s been exciting.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Spanning 45,000 nautical miles, four oceans and six continents, the Volvo Ocean Race is the world’s premier long-distance sailing event. It takes place every three years and puts the world’s top sailors in an around-the-clock, around-the-world pursuit of history.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the second time, Charlie Enright ’08 and Mark Towill ’11 will take to the sea as teammates in the event. Both were stars on the men’s sailing team and kept their passion alive after graduation. With Enright skippering the boat in 2014, the two finished fifth of seven in their first Volvo Ocean Race, sailing for team Alvimedica. With experience under their belt this time around, Enright and Towill are chasing an overall victory in the 2017-18 race. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">All the while, this event operates against the backdrop of a larger issue: Sporting events create large amounts of waste, especially from the food and beverages served in single-use containers. The Guardian estimates that each fan consumes about 4 kilograms of CO2 when attending a sports event, and this number jumps up if fans drive to the event or consume food there.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But the sport of sailing, perhaps because of its reliance on the ocean environment, is leading the charge in sustainability efforts in sports. In all levels of sailing competition, single-use plastic water bottles are banned. In collegiate sailing, a race committee has the power to disqualify a sailor that they see littering in the water. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Enright and Towill are entering this race with their own sustainability message. The team has two title sponsors: Vestas and 11th Hour Racing. 11th Hour Racing, based in Newport, is a foundation that promotes eco-friendly marine activity, especially in sailing and recreational boating. While sailing events can often have unintentional consequences for marine ecosystems, Enright and Towill, through their partnership with 11th Hour Racing, aim to be the most sustainable team in the race. Furthermore, 11th Hour Racing is working closely with the Volvo Ocean Race as a whole to devise more sustainable ways to transport supplies. It has also banned single-use plastic in the race and is providing a model of sustainability for other world sporting events to follow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Volvo Ocean Race’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>partnership with 11th Hour Racing is a huge step for the sport and sends a clear message regarding the priorities of sailors and sailing events as a whole. For the Volvo Ocean Race, 11th Hour Racing has taken on the role of consulting on waste removal in stopover cities and throughout the race.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">More generally, most international sporting events disrupt the environment by building stadiums, stands and other structures that must be disassembled after or are not met with long-term demand. One striking example of this is the infrastructure built for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. With the exception of the famous Bird Nest, which primarily serves as a tourist attraction rather than an event space, the vast majority of stadiums, fields and bleachers assembled for the event have simply been abandoned. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Event organizers and venues need to realize that outsourcing waste removal to sustainability organizations is a clear and surefire way to minimize this environmental harm. Few events involve these groups to clean up the stadium’s waste after the event has finished. Recently, the Rio Olympics took a step where Beijing and Sochi fell short by partnering with local sustainability organizations to manage recycling and waste removal from event areas. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Volvo Ocean Race circumnavigates the globe over eleven legs, separated by stopovers at host cities. In each host city, the teams engage in an in-port race, which tests the sailors’ tactics and boat handling on a smaller course. With a more experienced team this year, Enright and Towill look to improve their ocean racing tactics as well as familiarity and comfortability with the longer legs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While the sailing world waits with baited breath for this epic race to begin next month, the Volvo Ocean Race has built a model of sustainability for other sporting events to follow. These occasions are too important to society to be eliminated; the challenge is to adjust our mentality surrounding them so that we are as environmentally concious as possible. The Brown community should be heartened to see two graduates taking on such an extreme athletic challenge while promoting sustainability practices in sports.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following a victory over Dartmouth last weekend to open conference play, the women’s soccer team had its five-game winning streak snapped, falling<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to Columbia 1-0 in overtime Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Columbia’s Natalie Neshat scored the evening’s lone goal in the 97th minute, tapping a first-touch shot in the back of the net from the left side of the box.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A strong defensive showing allowed the Bears (8-3-0, 1-1 Ivy) to fend off a persistent Lions (6-4-1, 2-0) offense in regulation. Veteran goalkeeper Christine Etzel ’19 made a season-high seven saves in a busy night as Bruno was outshot 18-8 overall and 8-4 in shots on goal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our defensive unit was very solid — we handled them well,” Etzel said. “We needed to push the game offensively a bit more and put away some of our chances.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Defensively, we’re getting better every game, taking our roles a little bit more seriously and being more aggressive,” said Head Coach Kia McNeill. “The most disappointing part is that I didn’t feel like we threw our full arsenal at them — I didn’t think we had much of an attack.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Offensively, the Bears struggled to capitalize early and establish themselves with enough conviction in the final third to generate goals.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“As the game wore on, we didn’t get enough connection from our backs to our forwards, and that was ugly,” McNeill said. “It forced us to play a more defensive game than I would have liked. Columbia did a good job of trying to disrupt our rhythm as a team and really disrupt our attacking presence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mikela Waldman ’18 led Bruno with two shots on goal in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the stakes of conference play rise with five games remaining, the Bears remain confident and focused on securing an Ivy crown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We know every Ivy League game is just like a championship because we only play each team once,” Etzel said. “The mentality we have going into every game is … really pushing the game, doing our best to try and get the result we really want.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The pressure builds with every game, but our team is confident in ourselves and in our ability,” McNeill said. “We just have to play to our potential and we know that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">McNeill emphasized the importance of effective practice in preparation for this weekend’s clash against a Princeton team that sits tied with Columbia in first place.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We need to have a really focused week of training and really execute a couple things that will make us dangerous,” McNeill said. “We know what’s on the line, and our team will rise to the occasion.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will host Princeton at Stevenson-Pincince Field Saturday. Kickoff is scheduled for 3:30 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3">Coming off of a victory against Boston University Tuesday, the Bears took to the road for their Ivy League opener against the Columbia Lions. Bruno (5-2-1, 0-1 Ivy) was unable to capitalize on scoring opportunities and was dealt a 3-0 loss.</p>
<p class="p4">The Lions (5-0-2, 1-0), who are defending Ivy League co-champions and currently ranked 23rd in the country, were hot coming into conference play after three straight victories.</p>
<p class="p4">“We created enough chances to win the game,” said Toby Howell ’19. “But we were overall second best to them in and around the box.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears started fast, trying to exploit their height advantage against the Lions with high throw-ins toward the 18-yard box. But Columbia struck first on a counterattack in the sixth minute after a throw-in. The Bears were unable to clear the ball out of their 18-yard box, allowing Dylan Mott to take advantage of Bruno’s defensive breakdown to create a one-on-one with the goalkeeper and score his first goal of the season.</p>
<p class="p4">Following the goal, the Bears could not get into an offensive rhythm and failed to consistently get the ball out of their defensive zone. Mott threatened again with a header, but this time it was easily handled by Joey Cipicchio ’18.</p>
<p class="p4">Columbia looked primed to add a second goal in the middle of the first half, as Cipicchio came out of his box to defend, leaving the net wide open. Fortunately for the Bears, their strong defense was able to shut down the scoring opportunity.</p>
<p class="p4">The Lions continued to dominate possession of the ball and create shot opportunities throughout the first half. Disaster struck for the Bears in the 35th minute when Columbia forward Arthur Bosua was fouled in the 18-yard box on a corner, leading to a Lions penalty kick. Alex Bangerl took the penalty and placed it perfectly in the top right corner to put the Lions up a pair of goals late in the first half.</p>
<p class="p4">The one-sidedness was clear in the stats, as the Lions outshot the Bears 10-2 and led 5-3 in corner kicks. As the second half began, both teams traded shots, but none were close to a scoring opportunity.</p>
<p class="p4">Conor Gregory ’20 nearly put the Bears on the board in the 57th minute with a rocket off of a throw-in by Quinn English ’18 that just barely missed the net.</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears had a much more determined attack in the second half, but the Lions kept Bruno without a shot on goal for most of the period with timely blocks.</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno’s strong second half was not enough; after a Bears defensive turnover in the 79th minute, the Lions scored again. The goal from Bosua, off a pass from Beto Carillo, doomed any possibility of a Brown comeback.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’re frustrated, but we know what we need to work on now, so we’re not leaving completely empty-handed,” Howell said. “We knew going into this game that our season wasn’t going to be won or lost in the next 90 minutes.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears will look to rebound when they return home for their second Ivy League match against the Princeton Tigers at 7 p.m. Saturday at Stevenson-Pincince Field.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">At the annual Strike ALS match Friday, the volleyball team fell three sets to zero against Princeton, the defending Ivy League Champions. Despite the outcome, standout performances from Shirin Tooloee ’18 and Joanne Won ’21 and a near-comeback in the third set kept the crowd excited.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the first set, Bruno’s (5-9, 0-3 Ivy) high energy manifested itself into crisp passing and sharp attacks that kept the Tigers (10-3, 3-0) on their toes. A five point streak bolstered by Tooloee’s dominance from the baseline gave Brown a 14-12 lead. But the advantage was short-lived ­— after leveling the score at 15, Princeton kept the lead and ultimately won the set, 25-21.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hope of a fresh start in the second set did not last long. Bruno dropped the first three points and never recovered the lead. Princeton’s blocking was nearly impeccable, particularly against attacks from Bruno’s right side hitters, while the Bears’ blocking faltered more than it succeeded. The Tigers won the set 25-16.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In the first set, they fought really hard,” said Head Coach Diane Short of her team. “In the second set, we ran into a bad rotation that seemed to suck all the energy out of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The third set saw a complete reversal. After regrouping in the locker room, Brown found its rhythm again. A solo block by Courtney Palm ’19 followed shortly by a kill from Tooloee — her ninth of the match — set the pace, as Bruno took a 2-0 lead in the set.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We realized that we all need to come together and bring our energy back up,” Tooloee said. “That was the big difference. In the first and third sets we had so much energy and we were so excited to play. In the second set we just kinda lost it a little bit.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite the Bears’ rally, the Tigers got a second wind after calling timeout trailing 17-20. Bruno became scrambled on court, losing rallies on attack errors and miscommunications. Ultimately, Princeton scraped by in the set with a 25-23 win to claim the match.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the loss, Tooloee had a .310 hitting percentage and led the team with 12 kills. Won registered a team-high 13 digs in only her second Ivy League apperance as Brown’s libero.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite the loss, Coach Short, Tooloee and teammates have reason to be optimistic. For one, the Spike ALS Match raised over $9,000 — far exceeding the $6,000 goal — to support ALS research. The Bears are also eager for the chance to test themselves on court again. “If anything, this makes us just want to win more,” Tooloee said. “We have fueled the fire now.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown dropped Saturday’s match to Penn in five sets. The team will continue conference play, hosting Cornell Friday and Columbia Saturday. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the floodlights illuminating Brown Stadium Saturday night, quarterback Thomas “TJ” Linta ’18 orchestrated a three-touchdown comeback to seal Brown’s 24-21 victory over the University of Rhode Island and reclaim the Governor’s Cup. After falling to Harvard last weekend, the Bears (2-1, 0-1 Ivy) bounced back by besting the Rams (1-4), who handed the Crimson its only loss. Linta finished with 28 completions for 226 passing yards on the day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s something about the Governor’s Cup that brings out the best in Brown football,” said Head Coach Phil Estes P’19. “I knew we were going to get that cup back.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first half was reminiscent of last week’s loss to Harvard, as Bruno’s lone score came off a field goal and turnovers hindered offensive execution. A fumbled punt in the return in the first quarter gave the Rams the ball back on their own 46 yard line. URI followed with a 54-yard rush into the endzone to put the Rams up 7-0 in the first quarter. The Bears responded by recovering a fumble of their own but settled for three points. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhody capitalized on a another fumble recovery late in the second quarter, taking a 14-3 lead before halftime. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second half was an entirely different story, as Brown hung 21 unanswered points on the Rams in the third quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno went 74 yards in four plays on its first offensive possession after the half as Linta hit Jakob Prall ’20 for a 41-yard bomb to open the scoring drive. Darius Daies ’21 recorded his first collegiate touchdown in his first appearance this season, rushing 22 yards and flipping into the end zone to cut Rhody’s advantage to four. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The leaders in the locker room really stepped up at halftime trying to get everyone composed,” said free safety Connor Coughlin ’18. “It was still a ball game. We knew we were playing very well and that we just needed to execute a little better than we did in the first half.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once the Bears’ offense clicked, there was no stopping it. A pair of rushes from Daies and another clutch reception by Prall put Brown back in the red zone, where Linta found Issac Whitney ’18 for 18 yards and a touchdown, giving Bruno a 17-14 lead — its first of the game. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To cap off the comeback, Daies notched his second rushing touchdown of the night with 2:57 left in the third quarter, bringing the score to 24-14. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re trying everything we can now to get the best people on the field who can give us a spark,” Estes said. “The Darius adjustment was really good. He became our secret weapon.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the lead, Brown’s defense kept URI in check, allowing only one more score in the final quarter. A desperate attempt to tie the score resulted in a Rhody field goal sailing wide left as the game clock dwindled. Coughlin broke up three passes on the night but made his presence especially known in the fourth quarter, disrupting a completion on a crucial URI fourth down to settle the final score. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo presented co-captains Isaiah Thompkins ’19 and Richard “Dewey” Jarvis ’17.5 with the Governor’s Cup, as the team celebrated Brown’s 73rd victory in 102 all-time matchups in the series. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears are back on the road Saturday, traveling to Florida to face off against Stetson University before returning home to reopen conference play against Princeton Oct. 14. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Blasberg &#039;18: Who is the Red Sox’s best option as Game 3 starter?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Phew. After a stressful two weeks of the Red Sox fending off the surging Yankees, Boston finally won the American League East on the penultimate game of the season. But the Red Sox did not have much time to rest or celebrate, as its American League division series matchup against the Houston Astros began Thursday afternoon. Squaring off against the dangerous Astros offense presents a difficult challenge for the Red Sox pitchers. Their starters for the first two games were decided early, and the team decided the third Thursday afternoon: ace Chris Sale, Drew Pomeranz and Doug Fister, respectively. Sale and Pomeranz have had spectacular seasons and are the unequivocal two best pitchers on the team. Heading into the series, the pitcher that would start for the third game was up for debate among the media. The Red Sox must play the first two games of this best of five series in Houston, and Game 3 will undoubtedly be a high-leverage game.</p>
<p class="p3">With David Price now pitching out of the bullpen, the Red Sox had three real options to round out the playoff rotation: Eduardo Rodriguez, Rick Porcello and Doug Fister. While each player has the potential for a great start but also has major weaknesses. After Sale and Pomeranz, the Red Sox don’t have a starting pitcher who can threaten the Astros in the playoffs.</p>
<p class="p3">In my mind the most probable starter for Game 3 would have been Rick Porcello, last year’s Cy Young Award winner. He has the most recent postseason experience of the three. Despite last year’s success, Porcello has struggled this season and in prior playoff appearances, racking up an earned run average of 5.66 over seven postseason starts. Last year’s nightmarish flop in Game 1 of the 2016 ALDS against the Indians is still fresh in the minds of Red Sox fans. His struggles this year boil down to his fastball lacking movement and his breaking pitches hanging up. While his fastball, especially his two-seam fastball, had a really nice tail to it last season, it has been flat in 2017. Likewise, his sliders, which resulted in many groundball outs last season, haven’t been breaking as hard. As a result, Porcello yielded career highs in home runs, hits, runs and losses. Furthermore, he is particularly susceptible to giving up big hits, which can be lethal in the postseason. While he has shown glimpses of the pitcher he was last year, Porcello is a major gamble to put on the mound in a potentially series-deciding game, especially against a team as offensively savvy as the Astros.</p>
<p class="p3">Fister was strong for much of the second half of the season and is a viable choice as a postseason starter. He has been to the playoffs four times and actually owns a respectable 2.60 ERA through 55 innings. But two major issues have arisen, in Fister’s recent outings. The first is fatigue. It is evident that his arm has been ailing him this September, as he has not finished the sixth inning in any of his last four starts. Those recent starts were highlighted by giving up six runs to the Oakland Athletics and four to the Baltimore Orioles. Fister’s other weakness is the first inning. Fister has yielded first inning runs in eight of his last nine starts. And playing from behind is never a situation a team wants to be in, especially during the playoffs when runs are at a premium. If Fister gets the Red Sox in an early hole, its offense, which lacks home run power, will likely struggle to come back.</p>
<p class="p3">Eduardo Rodriguez is perhaps the least accomplished of these three pitchers, but he is the starter I would have liked to see at home in Game 3. Though he has been struggling with similar fatigue issues as Fister, he has shown tremendous positives through the first five innings of his starts during the season. Trouble generally seems to arise when Rodriguez stays in the game with his pitch count high, but he does have a knack for keeping the Red Sox close through five innings. In the playoffs, there is no need for Rodriguez on the mound late in games, seeing as the Red Sox now have two strong multi-inning relievers in Joe Kelly and David Price.</p>
<p class="p3">The bullpen has been one of the Red Sox’ major strengths throughout the season and the team would be wise to ease the load on the Game 3 starter by leaning on relief pitchers. Especially if the starter is Rodriguez or Fister, the bullpen will definitely play a role in the game. Red Sox manager John Farrell has his work cut out for him this weekend both on and off the field. If the Red Sox are to advance in the postseason, he must constantly manage his starters well.</p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: How Kevin Durant can shake his haters</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Golden State Warriors are on top of the basketball world. They dominated last season by an incredible margin, losing only one playoff game on their path to the championship. To make things even easier, thanks to Kevin Durant taking less money on his contract, the team was able to re-sign all of its players facing free agency. Golden State actually improved over the offseason, adding Nick Young and Omri Casspi to their already spectacular bench. Without a catastrophic series of injuries, the Warriors are almost sure to capture another championship this year and are likely to add two or three more in the future. Everyone in the organization should be riding high.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But one person is not riding so high right now — superstar Kevin Durant himself. One would assume that the Finals MVP spent his summer enjoying his status as champion. After all, Durant left the Oklahoma City Thunder and co-star Russell Westbrook for the Warriors and was rewarded with an easy championship run. With four of the NBA’s top 15 players, a dynamic second unit and a roster without any weaknesses, the Warriors were expected to roll over the rest of the league — and that is just what they did. No other team came close to touching them. Why should Durant care what some angry fans have to say about him and his perceived sell-out move? His team won.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Durant has said he does not care. But his actions tell another story. Durant cares so little that his new shoes feature insoles with common criticisms of him written on them — so he can effectively “stomp” on his haters. Durant cares so little that a commercial appeared after the Finals all about him “proving his critics wrong.” Durant cares so little that he spent his summer engaging in Twitter wars against fans who insulted him and created a series of alternate Twitter and Instagram accounts to compliment and defend himself in arguments with other random users.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Warriors were reportedly “perplexed” by his offseason activities, which makes sense. Someone like his teammate, Draymond Green, cannot possibly understand Durant — Green feeds off hate and performs best when treated with hostility on the court. Durant, on the other hand, just wants to be liked.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Durant mistakenly thought that a championship would turn public opinion around. The commercial, mentioned above, showed him hushing up his critics by winning the Finals. That is the whole issue, though. Everyone believed the Warriors would win the championship from the day of Durant’s decision. The entire reason everyone was mad at Durant was because it would be so easy for him to win, joining the team that knocked him out of the playoffs in 2016 and won the championship in 2015. He did not prove anyone wrong by going 16-1 in the playoffs. He proved the public right. The championship was never in doubt, not even for a second, and I’m saying this as a Cleveland Cavaliers fan.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The reaction to the victory rattled Durant. He expected to be loved again, especially after watching LeBron James gain back the admiration of the sports world by toppling Golden State in the 2016 Finals. When fans continued their criticism of his move to Golden State, among other things, he lashed out on Twitter more and more, sometimes spending hours arguing with trolling fans.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Everything came to a head when he was caught bashing the Thunder organization. Durant forgot to switch to an alternate account and tweeted from his main account that he “didn’t like playing for Billy Donovan. His roster wasn’t that good.” The story went nationwide. Durant said, when apologizing, that he had not eaten or slept over the past two days. In what should have been the happiest summer of his career, Durant was miserable and at his lowest point.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Believe it or not, Durant was a free agent this summer as well. He re-signed with the Warriors, of course, as was planned last year. But by doing so, he lost his escape route. Durant wants to be liked again, a superstar without polarization. More championships with Golden State certainly will not help him in that cause. If Golden State wins 70 games and sweeps through the playoffs this season, the hate will only increase. Same thing if they win the 2019 championship. And so on in 2020. That is why Durant should have left the Warriors this past offseason.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Durant needed to take more time to consider his decision to re-commit to the Warriors. If he had left and signed with his hometown Washington Wizards, or the Miami Heat, or the Los Angeles Clippers, or even the Boston Celtics, then the hate might have faded away. In that case, a championship would truly shut the haters up. The Warriors and Cavaliers, after all, would still be the favorites. A single championship victory like LeBron’s in 2016 or Dirk Nowitzki’s in 2011 would do far more for Durant’s legacy than the three or four he will probably win in Golden State.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But Durant lost his chance and now he is stuck. In the end, he made the best possible decision for the Golden State Warriors and the worst possible decision for Kevin Durant. As this season unfolds, watch out for Durant’s off the court antics — they could become even bigger stories than the Warriors themselves.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Before the football team’s victory over the University of Rhode Island Saturday, rookie running back Darius Daies ’21 hadn’t recorded a single collegiate touch. But after somersaulting into the end zone for Bruno’s first touchdown of the Governor’s Cup, Daies became the team’s secret weapon. He led the Bears’ rushing attack with 16 carries for 95 total yards and two touchdowns. Despite playing only two quarters all season, Daies is now Bruno’s overall leading rusher.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Daies was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week and one of the Brown Athletics student athletes of the week, and he received recognition from FCS Stats as an honorable mention nominee for National Freshman Player of the Week. For his game-changing performance and impressive acrobatics, Daies has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Herald: Before Saturday, you didn’t have a single collegiate carry. What were you thinking when Coach Phil Estes ’18 called your number to go into the game?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Daies: I was kind of confused at first because there was about a minute left in the first half. I thought he was just going to put me in just so the other running backs wouldn’t get too tired or hurt.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>You went on to score two rushing touchdowns that gave Brown a chance to beat URI. What was that like?</b></p>
<p class="p4">That was super exciting — probably the most exciting thing that’s ever happened to me in football. It just felt surreal.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Was that flip into the endzone really necessary?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Looking at it now, no. But I thought it was then!</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I was looking between here, Harvard and Columbia, and I just really liked the atmosphere here a lot more than I liked the other ones. The other ones — at least Harvard — seemed a little more cutthroat and intense. Here, it’s a really chill vibe. No matter if you play a sport, if you’re in clubs or if you’re just a regular student, everybody is easy to get along with and talk to. I like that a lot.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>How’d you get into football?</b></p>
<p class="p4">My dad played defensive back at the University of Florida, so it’s just a thing in my family. I started playing in first grade.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Do you have superstitions or pre-game rituals?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I just like to listen to my music.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>What’s your go-to pre-game song?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Right now it’s “I Get the Bag” by Gucci Mane. It’s our team song sort of, so I listen to it a lot.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>Is there another athlete you model your game after?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">In St. Louis I was good friends with (Dallas Cowboys running back) Ezekiel Elliott’s family, so he was always a mentor to me growing up. He was my big brother for our track team growing up, so I’ve always wanted to be like him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>You went to the same high school as Boston Celtics rookie and third overall pick in the NBA draft Jayson Tatum. What was that like?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">We were pretty good friends. We were in the same homeroom for two years, so we got to know each other. I have his number still and his snapchat and everything. He’s a really cool guy. He’s funny as heck.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>Who’s on your fantasy football team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">I’ve never played in my life and still don’t play. But if I had a fantasy team, I’d have Kareem Hunt, Julio Jones and Tom Brady because he’s amazing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><i>— This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bears edged by first place Ivy rival No.11 Princeton</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The women’s soccer team took a lead into the half against No. 11 Princeton last Saturday at Stevenson-Pincince Field, but surrendered a pair of goals late in the second stanza and dropped a pivotal Ivy League contest to the nationally-ranked Tigers. The 2-1 loss follows last week’s overtime defeat at Columbia and puts Brown in a tie for fifth place in the conference standings. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jennifer Caruso ’19 gave the Bears (8-4-0, 1-2-0 Ivy) an early lead in the 10th minute, driving in a rebound through traffic in front of the net. Star White ’21 picked up an assist on the play, after Celia Story ’19 played in a corner kick from the right side.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Facing its second defeat of the year, Princeton (11-1, 3-0) answered, scoring two goals in one minute to reclaim the advantage. Courtney O’Brien accounted for both tallies, finishing off a header from Natalie Larkin in the 75th minute and driving in a rebound 56 seconds later.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Princeton hasn’t gone down much this season — I think they’ve gone down once. We wanted to test them in that situation and let them face a little bit of adversity,” said Head Coach Kia McNeill. “Our forwards did well — I wish we put a couple more opportunities away, and, in games like this, it comes down to finishing your chances.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The teams matched one another with six shots on goal, although Princeton led with a 17-8 advantage in total shots. Goalkeeper Christine Etzel ’19 made three saves in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the team enters its final four conference games of the season, it seeks to maximize possession and capitalize on scoring opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I still think that we can minimize some of our unforced errors when we’re playing out from the midfield and moving the ball up top,” McNeill said. “The last thing is just being more clinical in front of the goal. We’ve just got to be a little bit more hungry in the (18-yard box) … get on the ends of crosses and follow things up.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the loss, McNeill said she was optimistic about the team’s ability to challenge the nationally-ranked Tigers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The positive from this is the fact that that’s the number 11 team in the country,” McNeill said. “Anybody who was here watching the game can see that we can play with anybody in the country, and, if anything, I think that this should just set a new standard for what Brown women’s soccer can play like.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The matchup also served as Bruno’s “Think Pink” game in support of cancer research. The Bears took the field in pink socks and warm-up gear to raise awareness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno continues conference play with a visit to Harvard Saturday. The Bears return home to host Penn at Stevenson-Pincince Field Oct. 28.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Returning home to the comfort of Stevenson-Pincince Field after losing to Columbia last week, the Bears faced the Princeton Tigers in their first home conference game of the season. Both teams came into the game with 0-1 records in the Ivy League, which created a must-win playoff atmosphere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a game that honored the Brown National Collegiate Athletic Association Final Four teams from 1973, 1975 and 1977 at halftime, Bruno (6-2-1, 1-1 Ivy) was able to capture the magic of those squads in a 1-0 victory. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We brought a lot of really high energy to the game,” said Quinn English ’18. “We set the tempo, and we set the pace. They had trouble keeping up with us.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno’s offense pushed the Tigers (2-6-2, 0-2 Ivy) to the limit in the first half, earning six corner kicks in the first 17 minutes of the game. The Bears threatened early as a well-struck corner kick by Jackson Goebel ’20 in the second minute resulted in a shot from Jack Hagstrom ’19 that soared barely wide of the net. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Brown was unable to capitalize on these early opportunities. The Tigers countered with their own chances, but they were all handled by Brown goalkeeper Joey Cipicchio ’18. Most notably, Cipicchio made a diving save in the 28th minute on a low, rolling shot by Benjamin Issroff to keep the score knotted at zero. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Bruno had a major scoring opportunity in the 35th minute on a corner kick. Tigers goalie Jacob Schachner fell down in the goal box but was able to gather himself in time to make a save on a header by Will Hayward ’21. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">At halftime, the teams were both scoreless while the Bears led in shots 5-4 and in corner kicks 7-1. The first half was also very physical, as both squads accrued a combined 14 fouls and two yellow cards. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just as they had earlier in the game, Brown created several scoring chances in the beginning of the second half, earning two corner kicks in the first three minutes. But, unlike the first half, Brown converted the opportunity. In the 49th minute, English notched his second goal of the season on a one-timer on an assist from the left side of the field by Daniel Schiller ’20 to give the Bears a 1-0 lead. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s no better feeling in the world than scoring in front of the fans and on our home field,” English said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the half continued, both teams exchanged shots without many notable chances on goal. On a shot by Gabe Welp ’18.5 after a throw-in from English in the 64th minute, Schachner was forced to make a challenging save on a promising Bears opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In the 83rd and 84th minutes, Schachner made a few more key saves on a well-placed header by English and a powerful shot from outside the 18-yard box by Connor Gregory ’20. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The Tigers were unable to score<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as the clock ran down, giving the Bears their first Ivy League win of the season. Brown finished with a 14-6 advantage in shots and an 11-2 lead in corner kicks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno will take to the road to face crosstown rival Providence College Wednesday before continuing Ivy League play at Harvard Saturday. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Football falls in nonconference game against Stetson University</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Newcomer Jeffrey “Mitchell” Jonke ’21 became Brown’s third quarterback to see time in the pocket this season as the football team fell to Stetson University 17-13 Saturday. The Bears (2-2, 0-1 Ivy) traveled over 1,200 miles to DeLand, Florida<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to wrap up nonconference play against the Hatters (1-5) as the teams faced off for the second consecutive year. A late comeback effort led by Jonke and rookie running back Darius Daies ’21 was cut short as the Bears missed an extra point attempt and fumbled on their final offensive possession. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(The loss) was disappointing because that was a team that we could have beaten, and it would have been nice to have some momentum going into Ivy League play,” Jonke said. “But I’m confident in our team and how we’re responding to it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Quarterback Thomas “TJ” Linta ’18 secured the start for the Bears coming off his performance last week against the University of Rhode Island. The veteran was in for three quarters, totalling 143 passing yards and a touchdown on 14 completions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The game remained scoreless for much of the first quarter as missed field goals terminated both teams’ opening drives. The Hatters went up by three with 28 seconds left in the quarter after intercepting a pass by Linta. But Linta shook off the turnover and hit Jaelon Blandburg ’20 for a 40-yard reception on the first play of Bruno’s next offensive possession. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Then a 19-yard reception by Anton Casey ’19 and rushes by David Moodie ’19 and Daies inched the Bears to the Stetson six where Linta connected with Demitri Jackson ’20 on a slant in the endzone, putting Brown up 7-3 early in the second quarter. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After two punts from each team, Stetson returned to the endzone to retake the lead late in the half. Bruno got the final possession but failed to generate much on offense before the clock expired, giving the Hatters a 10-7 edge going into the locker room. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We knew that you’re not losing a game just because you’re behind at the half,” Daies said. “We just said that we had to play better in the second half.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The momentum appeared to swing in Bruno’s favor at the start of the third quarter as co-captain Richard “Dewey” Jarvis ’17.5 forced a fumble on the Hatters’ opening drive, but Stetson was able to reclaim possession four plays later when Linta threw his second interception of the game. The pick resulted in Stetson’s second touchdown, solidifying the 17 points it would cling to for victory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jonke got his first collegiate touch late in the third quarter and managed to give Bruno six more points with 8:55 left in the game. A 25-yard reception by Daies put the Bears in the red zone, and a 12-yard run on the next play gave the freshman his third collegiate TD. The field goal after sailed wide left, spelling the end of Brown’s comeback and settling the final score at 17-13.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was disappointing, but it’s nice to get that out of the way before we step into the Ivy League completely,” Daies said. “Everything gets way more intense now that we’re all in the Ivy. We know the Ivy League is wide open right now because a lot of teams are winning, and a lot of teams are losing. … Our eyes are still wide open for finishing as high as we can.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno is 2-1 against nonconference opponents but will turn its attention to league matchups for the remainder of the season, looking first to Princeton Saturday. The Bears will host the Tigers (3-1, 0-1) at Brown Stadium for Homecoming. The kick-off is set for 12:30 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The volleyball team fell one set to three against Cornell Friday but rallied the next day to break a four-game losing streak with a 3-1 victory over Columbia. Courtney Palm ’19, Melissa Cairo ’18 and Makena Ehlert ’20 made large individual contributions over the weekend, and Head Coach Diane Short praised her team for its offensive balance and the trust teammates had in one another.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Friday, though Bruno (6-10, 1-4 Ivy) took a tight first set 26-24, a defensively scrambled second set put the Bears behind Cornell (6-8, 2-3) for the rest of the match. Bruno entered the fourth set down 2-1, but battled the Big Red to 24-24 down the stretch. But the Bears slipped in the last two rallies to drop the match. Outside hitters Ehlert, Sabrina Stillwell ’19 and Shirin Tooloee ’18 combined for more than half of Bruno’s total kills with eight apiece.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next day, Bruno dramatically improved against the Columbia Lions (5-9, 0-5). “The best thing about this match is (that) we had a balanced offense, and we haven’t had that in a couple weeks,” Short said. “Defensively, less collisions than last match.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cairo and Ehlert lead Bruno’s defense with 18 and 16 digs respectively, making competitive diving plays to thwart many of Columbia’s attack attempts. Their hard work, in turn, gave Brown the opportunity to execute textbook bump-set-spike sequences.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Tonight was really good on setting and passing,” said Palm. The middle blocker led the team with 14 kills and a .410 hitting percentage. “Our team vibe was really good. We were communicating well, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This communication resulted in many successful Bruno attacks, which stymied the Lion defense. Columbia lost a significant number of rallies on uncontrolled dig attempts that went out of bounds or prevented the Lions from setting up a proper offensive attack.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the second set, Bruno turned a slow start into a five-point streak that set the tone for most of the match. Bruno did not trail Columbia until the Lions took the lead at 19-18, at which point attack errors and small missteps culminated in the Bears losing the set, with the game tied at one set apiece.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Between the second and third game, Bruno had the opportunity to refocus in the locker room. “I talked a lot about trusting their teammates,” Short said. “I told them, ‘Trust in each other.’”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And trust they did. Catching up after a 6-3 Columbia lead, the Bears did not look back, winning the third set 25-12 on the momentum of two five-point streaks and a seven-point streak to finish.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This time around, the team focused on maintaining the momentum from the win. “We were saying at the end of the third game, pretend that it was a time out, and that we were just going to keep grinding,” Palm said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Bruno did not have the same point-streaks in the fourth set as in the third, after tying at 4-4, the team never trailed Columbia and clinched the match with a decisive 25-14 victory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When asked how the first conference win felt, Palm said, “We’ve definitely been waiting on this one for a while, and it feels really good to finally get that. … We’re really happy things are finally gelling.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Short echoed Palm’s sentiments. “They know what they are now, and they will repeat it,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno’s next match is away at Harvard Oct. 13 at 7 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Women&#039;s hockey to play game against Chinese professional team</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">While the women’s hockey team will skate on a familiar arena Friday night, a new set of blades will also take the ice.</p>
<p class="p3">For the first time ever, the Bears will face off against a professional team in an exhibition game. Bruno will host the Kunlun Red Star, one of two teams based in China that are new members of the Canadian Women’s Hockey League, at Meehan Auditorium.</p>
<p class="p3">The Red Star is over 7,000 miles from its home in Shenzhen, China, but its head coach will be well-accustomed to the view from the bench at Meehan. Margaret Degidio “Digit” Murphy returns to Brown, where she spent 18 seasons as the head coach of the women’s hockey team from 1994-2011. Murphy later served as head coach and general manager of the Boston Blades of the CWHL before taking her position with the Kunlun program this year.</p>
<p class="p3">In the 2006-2007 season, Murphy became the winningest coach in NCAA Division I women’s hockey history and would collect six ECAC and five Ivy League titles during her tenure. She has long been an advocate for the advancement of women’s sports, co-founding the United Women’s Lacrosse League, the first professional women’s lacrosse league in the U.S., in 2015.</p>
<p class="p3">For Murphy, the decision to coach women’s hockey internationally was not a career choice but a calling. With this position, she seeks to expand opportunities in hockey for young women globally and combat inequality in the sport.</p>
<p class="p3">“I feel like my whole body of work in my life has led up to this global initiative,” Murphy said.</p>
<p class="p3">Presently, there are fewer opportunities for women to play hockey professionally than there are for males. “A lot of times when you look at sports, the resource distribution is skewed heavily still towards men,” Murphy said.</p>
<p class="p3">“You’ve got to be very fearless in finding your voice and always advocating for doing the right thing, and the right thing is to have women play sports,” Murphy said. “My sons and my daughters should be equal when it comes to that.”</p>
<p class="p3">For another member of the Red Star, the ice at Meehan will be familiar. 2016-17 women’s hockey Captain Maddie Woo ’17 spent her collegiate career with the Bears before being drafted by the Red Star in the seventh round of the CWHL draft this summer.</p>
<p class="p3">Despite her illustrious record, Woo’s goodbye to Meehan was abrupt, coming when an injury sustained in the fifth game of the 2016-17 season brought her time in a Bears uniform to an end. Tonight, she will return to the ice she once called home for the first time since.</p>
<p class="p3">“I would never have imagined being able to come back to Brown so soon, let alone playing a game,” Woo said. “It’s unreal to think, but it’s even more exciting to come back with a team and a greater mission.”</p>
<p class="p3">Woo’s decision to play professionally in China takes on a deeper significance for her as well, as she reflected on her own personal desire to be a part of the effort to expand youth hockey for women on a global level.</p>
<p class="p3">“Having us all come together for the sheer purpose of growing hockey globally, having a love for the sport, wanting to compete and wanting to get better is just truly exciting,” Woo said.</p>
<p class="p3">The Kunlun Red Star and its Chinese peer, the Vanke Rays, were established in June 2017 as part of an effort to develop the Chinese women’s national ice hockey team ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="p3">Both the Red Star and Rays have a roster comprised of three goalies and twenty skaters, half of which are native to China, a quarter Chinese North Americans and a quarter North Americans. The North American women<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>provide guidance both on and off the ice, teaching the game to teammates and giving advice on nutrition, Woo said. The Kunlun Red Star features two Olympians — Finnish goaltender Noora Räty and American forward Kelli Stack — and several athletes that have competed at the world championship level.</p>
<p class="p3">“We’re taking these teams and trying to grow hockey from the grassroots level in China so that they have an understanding of the game,” Woo said.</p>
<p class="p3">While player development is a major emphasis, the Red Star’s mission is also one of discovery. China’s one-child policy, introduced in 1979, led to the adoption of many young Chinese girls by North American families in the late ’90s. Kunlun seeks to find those who have come of age playing hockey in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p class="p3">“If we can find one, two, three, four, five of them that play hockey, they could play for China,” Murphy said. “There’s a lot more that goes into this than just developing hockey players, it’s actually finding them.”</p>
<p class="p3">Despite facing challenges like the language barrier, the team is galvanized by a drive to learn from one another and a passion for advancing the sport in new communities.</p>
<p class="p3">0The Red Star and the Rays are currently travelling around the U.S. to compete against collegiate teams, with Vanke facing off against Cornell women’s hockey team in Ithaca Friday as well. During the teams’ American visits, they seek to gain publicity and attract fans in the nascent stages of their development.</p>
<p class="p3">“Being able to give (the Kunlun Red Star) the exposure here in the U.S. on a college campus and being able to attract more students to come out and watch and see the game grow internationally is just a wonderful experience,” said Brown Head Coach Bob Kenneally ’90. “There’s a lot of growth on the men’s side in different countries, and to continue to grow the game in women’s hockey is just really exciting.”</p>
<p class="p3">For the team, fans, players in other countries and young girls who dream of suiting up and skating out beneath the lights, the only way is up.</p>
<p class="p3">“Women have to find their voice. We’re over half the population, we need to be strong, we need to be proud and we need to advocate,” Murphy said. “To now be on a global stage to do this is a dream come true for me, and I’m just going to continue to step up on behalf of women.”</p>
<p class="p3">Face-off against the Kunlun Red Star is Friday at 6 p.m. at Meehan Auditorium. The first 50 students to arrive at the game will receive free t-shirts that feature a pink Brown logo in support of breast cancer awareness month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Led by middle blocker Courtney Palm ’19, the volleyball team snapped a four-game losing streak with a 3-1 victory over Columbia at home Saturday. After claiming the first set 25-19, the Bears (6-10, 1-4 Ivy) dropped the second to the Lions in a narow 25-22 finish. But Palm recorded nine kills in the last two frames, giving the Bears a huge advantage in an otherwise close game. She led the team in kills and finished the match with a career high of 14 on .417 hitting. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For her career-best performance and contributions to Bruno’s first conference win, Palm has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the win over Columbia. How did it feel to get that first Ivy victory of the season? </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Palm: It feels really great. It’s been a long time coming. We’ve been waiting on it, and we’re really happy to finally have everything come together and figure out what we need to do to win. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How did you first start playing volleyball?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I started playing volleyball sophomore year in high school. I was really late to the game because I was always playing softball, and I was a competitive skier and ran track. My high school team was really good. They had won state the past five years in a row, so they were trying to recruit me to play because I was tall and athletic. They finally convinced me to play, and then I fell in love with the game. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The environment overall is very welcoming. I just love the vibe. The atmosphere is really great. You get to be a part of everything, and there’s no social divide between students and athletes. You can be a member of any group you want to be. You get to customize your own experience.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What’s the best part of being a member of Brown’s volleyball team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Our team dynamic is probably one of the best in the Ivy League. All the girls are great, and it’s like having a second family. Everyone is really sweet, and we all care about each other. We all play for each other.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What has been your most memorable moment playing for the team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That game on Saturday. It was one of the best performances in my career. It was so great to have the trust between my teammates to give me the ball, and for us to succeed was really rewarding. It was really exciting to see it all come together. It was one of the top experiences of my volleyball career. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What are your goals for the rest of the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Personally, I’m just going to keep trying to push myself in the middle and work on my specific skills. I want to get better on offense and become an offensive threat to other teams. Normally, blocking is my strong suit, so I’m hoping to branch out and be able to build my offensive skills. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What’s the team’s mentality going into the remaining conference matches?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Stay determined. We had the losing streak for a while, and it was really awesome that we were able to stay mentally tough and come back and win on Saturday. We’re just looking to win in the future. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will look to improve their conference record against Harvard and Dartmouth Friday and Saturday before returning home to host Yale Oct. 20.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">— This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein &#039;19: Draft drama a welcome development for NBA All-Star Game</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NBA announced a total overhaul of the perrenially-disappointing All-Star Game last week;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>two teams, drafted by captains, will play the in game, instead of the customary Eastern Conference and Western Conference teams. The players in the draft pool will be the 24 selected for the All-Star Game via last year’s process — 12 from each conference, 10 starters selected by vote and 14 chosen by coaches. Additionally, proceeds from the game will now be donated to charities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reaction to the dramatic changes was mixed. The players who negotiated the move spoke out in praise. “I’m thrilled with what the players and the league have done to improve the All-Star Game, which has been a priority for all of us,” said National Basketball Players Association President and Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul. Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James said “We had to do something. … The All-Star Game has been pretty bad the last couple years just from a competition standpoint.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There was still some criticism leveled at the changes. The idea of team captains was found to be problematic — with the potential to cause unnecessary turmoil. Cavaliers guard J.R. Smith hoped that the league would not televise the draft process, saying also about the draft: “That’s a hard situation to put guys in. … I don’t think they really thought that thing through all the way.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But at the end of the day, regardless of the players’ potentially hurt feelings, changes needed to be made to the All-Star Game. The new format is a massive improvement in every way, and there will probably be further tweaks made over the next couple of years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The All-Star Game has been in decline for over a decade. The games in the early 2000s, while obviously not as competitive as a meaningful NBA game, were spirited affairs. Players took pride in representing their respective conferences and the closing minutes were intense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 2001 All-Star Game ended in a thrilling 111-110 Eastern Conference victory. Trailing 21 points with only nine minutes remaining, the East mounted a stunning comeback to win. Guard Stephon Marbury hit the game-winning shot with 28 seconds remaining.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 2003 contest, considered by many to be the greatest iteration of the game, was a 155-145 double-overtime Western Conference win. Michael Jordan sunk a shot with 4.8 seconds remaining in the first overtime to give the East a 138-136 advantage, but Kobe Bryant sunk two free throws after being fouled on a three pointer, tying the affair back up. The West took control in the second overtime and came away victorious.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2017’s version of the “competiton” was a 192-182 snooze. While one would assume that a game with such a high score would be a sight worth seeing, the points came so easily that there was little reason to watch. Players chucked up threes and lounged around the court, converting on a few open dunks. There was no defense to be seen whatsoever. Stephen Curry actually laid down on the floor instead of guarding a fast break opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The difference between past and present is clear. The game precipitously worsened in quality and grew more boring with each new year. There is simply no incentive for players to risk injury in a completely meaningless game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The new format provides the necessary motivation and for good causes. While it is not exactly clear yet what the charity component entails, we know for sure that each team will play for a Los Angeles-based charity, which should encourage players to actually make an effort. And of course, the more money that goes to those who need it, the better.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Motivation will come too from the new All-Star Game draft. Though some players may worry about hurt feelings, the All-Star Game is supposed to be entertaining, and the potential drama a draft could create could capture everyone’s attention. The Kevin Durant-Russell Westbrook and LeBron James-Kyrie Irving feuds will generate most of the headlines, but there will be fun tension no matter what the teams are. Whoever is picked last will have a giant chip on his shoulder, and nothing motivates athletes like disrespect.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">New rivalries can form as well. Maybe LeBron James passes on taking Giannis Antetokounmpo for his buddy Carmelo Anthony. Or maybe Stephen Curry picks teammate Klay Thompson instead of James Harden. What if someone passes on a teammate to take a better player? The possibilities are endless.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The All-Star Game, with its new format, has become a reality television version of the NBA, which will be a lot more thrilling to watch than NBA players lackadaisically jogging. Dunks and three-pointers are fun when they occur in a competition. A Stephen Curry three-pointer from almost half court against the Oklahoma City Thunder? Awesome. A Stephen Curry three-pointer with no one near him as LeBron James half-heartedly walks in his direction? Less awesome.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No matter what happens next February, at the very least, the All-Star Game coverage is now worth watching. Change has been a long time coming and the format will only get better in the future as the league finetunes the game, learning what worked and what did not. The NBA has once again proven its admirable ability to adapt.</span></p>

		<title>Grigo &#039;18: Is Clayton Kershaw due for a peak playoff performance?</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/13/grigo-18-clayton-kershaw-due-peak-playoff-performance/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following his outing last Friday against the Arizona Diamondbacks — a six-and-a-third-inning effort in which he surrendered four earned runs on four solo homers — Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw is now 15 starts and 95 and-a-third innings into his playoff career. That’s about a half-season’s worth of pitching, a sample large enough to warrant entertaining the possibility that Kershaw’s pedestrian playoff performance might be due to something other than random variation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kershaw owns a 4.63 earned run average in the postseason, a mark nearly double his career regular season 2.36 ERA. While fewer than 100 innings aren’t sufficient for ERA to stabilize near a pitcher’s true talent level, consider this: Since the end of his rookie season in 2008, Kershaw has had just two halves of seasons — the first halves of 2011 and 2009 — where his ERA has risen above 3.00.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The main cause of Kershaw’s playoff struggles has been his propensity to give up the long ball. He’s allowed more than twice as many home runs per nine innings in October as in the regular season. This could be connected to his poor playoff strand rate, the percentage of batters who reach base that fail to score, which sits 15.1 percentage points below his career regular season rate. It is tempting to blame Kershaw’s inability to keep teams in the yard on his inflated home run per fly ball percentage, as balls lifted in the air against him in the postseason have left for home runs nearly twice as often than over the rest of his career. HR/FB percent is notoriously volatile, and it could very well be the case that Kershaw has simply been a victim of the randomness of baseball.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Still, there are real concerns to be had about Kershaw’s playoff mediocrity. Hitters have popped more balls into the air with more authority against Kershaw in the postseason: Per Baseball Savant, batters have recorded an average launch angle 7.1 degrees higher off him in the playoffs with an average exit velocity 3.7 mph faster. Those numbers go a long way toward explaining Kershaw’s playoff HR/9 numbers, but it’s unclear how much of the uptick in opposing batters’ quality of contact is noise and how much can be attributed to something unique about the postseason.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The issue doesn’t seem to be Kershaw wearing down late in the season, nor does it seem to stem from the amount of starts he has made on short rest in the playoffs. Kershaw’s average fastball velocity has actually risen .6 mph to an average of 94.4 mph in October, per Baseball Savant. And he’s pitched to the tune of a 3.15 ERA in the four starts he’s made on three days rest following a previous start — down a run and a half from his overall postseason ERA.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One area where Kershaw has faltered in October, though, is getting lefties out. Left-handed batters have posted a .243 weighted on-base average against Kershaw over his career during the regular season, but in the postseason, that number has spiked to .339, which is above the league average. Most of the damage has come off fastballs: Lefties are hitting .333 with a .704 slugging percentage against Kershaw’s four-seamer in the playoffs compared to just .219 and .380 in the regular season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The fastballs left-handed hitters have punished Kershaw on generally weren’t well executed pitches — except for the two in the top left corner in the graphic, batters have simply taken advantage of Kershaw catching the middle of the plate. Yet comparing Kershaw’s regular season fastball location heatmap to his postseason heatmap on Brooks Baseball, there exists little discernible difference. Kershaw makes mistakes in the regular season, too, they’re just getting ripped more often come October.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some of that might be dumb luck, but it appears that lefties have altered their approach against him in the playoffs. Over his regular season career, left-handed batters have swung at Kershaw fastballs located over the plate and in the middle horizontal third just 74.1 percent of the time, per data from Brooks Baseball. In the postseason, they’re offering at fastballs in that same location 85.96 percent of the time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kershaw has thrown too few playoff innings to make a definitive judgement about his effectiveness in October, and he’s certainly due for some regression to the mean in his home run prevention going forward. But if lefties really are, for whatever reason, making the conscious decision to jump on more of his fastballs in the playoffs, Kershaw may have to adapt if he wants to replicate his regular season success throughout the postseason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Dodgers are once again just four wins away from a National League pennant with game one of the National League Championship Series one day away. And given that the franchise’s current World Series championship drought dates back to 1988, the urgency is clear: Los Angeles needs their ace starting tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A little batted ball luck wouldn’t hurt, either.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For the first time since 2010, the women’s soccer team prevailed over Harvard with a 1-0 win in Cambridge Saturday. A goal from Jennifer Caruso ’19 and a shutout from goalkeeper Christine Etzel ’19 fueled Brown to victory, snapping a two-game slump and giving the Bears sole possession of fifth place in the Ivy League standings.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The senior class has never beaten Harvard, so we’re really happy that we were able to get the result,” Head Coach Kia McNeill said. “It’s even greater for the future of this program, setting a new expectation going forward.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Caruso scored the lone goal in the 54th minute, securing the victory for the Bears (9-4, 2-2 Ivy). Caruso collected a looping pass from Maclaine Lehan ’18, before sending a shot above a diving goalkeeper and into the right corner of the net. The goal was her second in two games.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was great for the team to get another win and a shutout,” Etzel wrote in an email to The Herald. “It’s exciting to still be improving with every game and continuing to build confidence as individuals and as a team.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears delivered a solid offensive performance, outshooting the Crimson (7-7, 1-3) 15-12. Bruno also held a 7-5 advantage in corner kicks.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We were really trying to push the pace of the game and attack the goal from both sides of the field,” Etzel wrote. “We always look to pressure the other team on all parts of the field, so our high pressure caught Harvard by surprise a couple times.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We matched them up in the (3-5-2 formation) — we wanted our wing midfielders to get involved with the attack and be more on the offensive,” McNeill said. “We were looking to switch the point of attack, and we gained some success from that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A strong defensive presence in the zone allowed the Bears to shut the Crimson down.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This week, we did a very good job … denying services and denying shots,” McNeill said. “I’m really proud of the way the defense played — they’ve deserved a shutout for a couple of games now, so I’m glad we got one against a very good team.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Etzel recorded her third shutout of the season, making four saves. For the first time ever, she faced off against her twin sister Danielle, who played in net for the Crimson in the first half.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Facing her sister down the field was a strange experience, Etzel wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was weird, to be honest,” Etzel wrote. “We’ve never actually played against each other on the same field, but we both went out and played like we normally would in any other Ivy League game.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the Bears prepare for their final trio of conference games, they seek to maintain their work ethic on and off the field.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve just got to focus on what we can do as a team and keep working hard,” Etzel wrote. “We want to finish out this season in the best way possible. Anything can happen in the Ivy League as every game is so important.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears visit Cornell Saturday, before returning home to host Penn at Stevenson-Pincince Field Oct. 28.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s cross country team squared off against several of the nation’s top squads in the <a href="ce: http://www.ustfccca.org/team-rankings-polls-central https://xc.tfrrs.org/results/xc/13251.html#93936">Division</a> I Pre-National XC Invitational Saturday, held at E.P. “Tom” Sawyer State Park in Louisville, Kentucky.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Competing without their number one runner, recently-injured captain Matt Mahoney ’18, the Bears found themselves in the middle of the pack. Bruno amassed 566 points to finish 21st in a field of 41 teams, including eight nationally ranked programs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Led by individual winner Rory Linkletter, No. 2 Brigham Young University dominated the competition, racking up a scant 41 points to claim the team title. BYU was beyond Bruno’s reach, but Brown handily beat Ivy League opponent Dartmouth; the Big Green sank to 38th-place overall beneath the weight of their 910-point total. The Bears also bested Yale by default, as the Bulldogs failed to finish a full squad of five scoring athletes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In Mahoney’s absence, Mike Wyman ’18 served as standard-bearer, covering the grassy eight-kilometer course in 24 minutes, 19 seconds. This clocking, a new personal best, was good for 79th place out of 282 finishers and marked the first time that Wyman — a middle-distance specialist on the track — has spearheaded the Bears in a cross country race. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gabe Altopp ’20, the team’s fifth finisher at last month’s Coast-to-Coast Battle in Beantown, was Brown’s second man across the line. Altopp squeaked into the meet’s top 100 by the skin of his teeth, running a personal-best 24:28 to score 97 points for the Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Oft-injured Dan McDonald Meteer ’18 — healthy after years of debilitating setbacks — continued to capitalize on his final season by finishing third for Brown. He ran 24:40, his fastest race yet,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>adding 118 points to Bruno’s total.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown’s fourth and fifth men competed strongly but were not able to break their personal records. Penultimate scorer Cam Daly ’20 ran 24:44 — his second-fastest 8K — to net 126 points. Captain Martin Martinez ’18 shut the door by running 24:54, his third-fastest 8K, for 148 points.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Entering the meet, Brown was ranked fourth in the USTFCCCA New England Coaches’ Poll. But regional rival Boston University, rated 14th in the same poll, upset the Bears by finishing 18th at the invitational. This does not bode well for Bruno’s position in the forthcoming edition of the rankings, which will be released Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears experienced greater success closer to Providence, albeit on a somewhat smaller stage. Brown’s B-squad triumphed over an array of local teams in the Rothenberg Invitational, held at Goddard State Park in Warwick Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno tallied 33 points to beat second-place University of Vermont by a margin of three — an accomplishment sweetened by the fact that all of Brown’s scorers set new personal bests. It was the first time the Bears had won on their home course since 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As was the case in Louisville, a middle-distance man led the charge for Brown in Warwick. 800-meter specialist Zach Lanigan ’20 from Australia bounded home third in 25:08, outpaced only by two Vermont harriers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tom Hale ’19 followed close on the heels of his teammate, clocking 25:12 to claim fifth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Lanigan’s always a force to be reckoned with,” Hale said. “Coming down the last straight we were neck-and-neck, but then he just blew by me. It was a good match.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Three first-year athletes made up the balance of Bruno’s scoring five: David Scherrer ’21 finished sixth in 25:12, Jared Yabu ’21 took eighth in 25:18 and Ben McCoy ’21 was 11th in 25:28. “They exceeded all expectations in a really positive way,” Hale said. “You can look at the results and see that they’ve really got what it takes.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will return to competition at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championship, to be hosted Oct. 28 in the Bronx’s historic Van Cortlandt Park.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Football fall to Tigers at home, 53-0</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/15/football-fall-tigers-home-53-0/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Updated Oct. 16 at 3:28 p.m.</strong>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">It has been five years since the football team last found itself on the wrong side of a shutout when, in 2012, Princeton hung 19 unanswered points on the Bears (2-3, 0-2 Ivy). This year, the Tigers (4-1, 1-1) put up 53, sealing victory with seven touchdowns and two field goals, not allowing Bruno to score once. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We didn’t come out and play the way we’re capable of playing,” said rookie quarterback Jeffrey “Mitchell” Jonke ’21. “They got on us early, and we just weren’t able to turn it around. Right now, we just have to use it as a learning tool. … We’re using this as a motivation to never play like that again.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rainy conditions hindered Brown’s running game and also made it difficult for quarterbacks Jonke and Thomas “TJ” Linta ’18 to handle the ball. A Brown fumble on the opening kickoff gave Princeton the ball deep in the Bears’ territory at the start of the game, and from there, the Tigers took over. They dominated every aspect of the game, forcing eight punts and racking up 538 total yards on offense, the most Brown’s defense has allowed all season. The Bears had no response for the Tigers’ stifling defense, amassing only 12 first downs and 170 yards of offense. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Tigers found success on the ground and through the air, splitting their yardage equally between rush and pass plays. Princeton quarterback Chad Kanoff completed 21 passes for two touchdowns, and running back Charlie Volker tallied 163 rushing yards on four scoring runs, including a 96-yard foray into the end zone in the second quarter. After notching 16 points in the first quarter and adding 20 more in the second, the Tigers went into the locker room with a comfortable 36-0 lead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starting quarterback Linta connected on seven of 12 passes for 55 yards before Jonke took over in the second half. Jonke made his second appearance of the season after seeing some time in the pocket during last week’s game against Stetson University. The first-year led Brown’s offense with 29 rushing yards and 60 passing yards on eight completions Saturday. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite the change of QB, the Bears still struggled to generate on offense. Princeton continued to score, posting 10 more points in the third quarter and one final touchdown early in the fourth to bring up the final 53-0.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got to get tougher," said Head Coach Phil Estes P'18. "We can’t worry about what the other team is doing so that we are hesitating. We have a defense and an offense to execute. It’s about doing your job and doing it really, really well." </span>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This is the time that we need to come together as a team because if we don’t, it’s really going to hurt our season,” Jonke said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown will continue conference play in Ithaca, New York against Cornell Saturday. Kickoff is set for 3 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3">The volleyball team took two losses on the road this weekend, dropping a match 3-1 against Harvard Friday and 3-0 against Dartmouth Saturday. These defeats drop Brown (6-12, 1-6 Ivy) to last place in the Ivy League standings halfway through conference play.</p>
<p class="p4">Though Bruno came out strong against the Crimson (10-6, 5-2), claiming the opening set 23-25, Harvard rallied in the second set with a resounding 25-14 win and never looked back. Riding the momentum of a couple long point streaks, the Crimson took the third and fourth sets 25-20 and 25-21,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>respectively. Bruno captain and libero Melissa Cairo ’18 earned a personal best 19 digs in the loss.</p>
<p class="p4">Both Brown and Dartmouth (7-9, 3-4) entered Saturday’s match looking to bounce back from tough losses, but the Big Green ultimately took the victory in straight sets. Cairo again led the Bears in digs with 11 and recent Herald Athlete of the Week Courtney Palm ’19 executed a team-high 8 kills.</p>
<p class="p4">In the first set, after leading 2-1, Bruno struggled to stand its ground against the Big Green. Two five-point streaks pushed Dartmouth out of the Bears’ reach and between offensive violations, defensive miscommunications and dominant Dartmouth blocking, Brown was unable to score more than two points in a row.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s really tough to play catch-up,” said Head Coach Diane Short. “It’s really hard because the other team can come at you more aggressively, where I think we came at them more afraid to make mistakes.”</p>
<p class="p4">Though Bruno entered the second set with more vigor, utilizing feinted attacks to scramble the Big Green’s defense, unforced errors and defensive disorganization continued to thwart the Bears. After an early five-point streak by Dartmouth, service between the teams changed regularly. But for every Brown point, Dartmouth scored two or three. The set finished 25-14.</p>
<p class="p4">Strong Bruno defense in the third set kept Dartmouth from taking an early lead and coordination between Brown setters and outside hitters helped the Bears penetrate Dartmouth’s blocking. Middle blocker Jacqueline Jacobs ’20 delivered several crucial blocks and kills to keep Brown going point-for-point with Dartmouth. Sabrina Stillwell ’19, Bruno’s stalwart right side hitter and outside hitter, also bolstered the Bears with her steady performance and six kills in the match.</p>
<p class="p4">When leading 20-19, Dartmouth caught a lucky break. Brown lost momentum after two unforced errors and the Big Green took full advantage, winning the set 25-19 and taking the match.</p>
<p class="p4">Looking forward to the second half of the Ivy League season, the team is hoping to bounce back. “We have the players, we’ve got some depth, we’ve just got to get it together,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Short said. “We’re looking forward to playing everyone again. Because we played them before, we know what we need to get better in those situations.”</p>
<p class="p4">This challenging weekend is, if anything, an opportunity to take away some lessons. “A good thing is that this team is pretty resilient,” Short said. “Even though we had a bad weekend, we’re going to start fresh this week and do some things to improve.”</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno’s will host Yale in its next match Friday at 7 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bears host breast cancer awareness events</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">This week, the football, men’s crew and women’s crew teams held events on campus to raise money and awareness for cancer research and survivors.</p>
<p class="p4">The football team held its annual Bench Press for Cancer event Monday on the Main Green. From 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., players came together to raise money for Miriam Hospital’s Cancer Survivorship Program for Young Adults. Two bench press stations, pink t-shirts, a speaker and free food — donated from nearby businesses like Dunkin’ Donuts and Hope Street Pizza — welcomed students to the Green, encouraging them todonate and participate themselves.</p>
<p class="p4">Players were encouraged to get friends, family and alums to sponsor them, either paying a certain amount per rep or donating at a flat rate, said Brett Estes ’18, organizer of the event.</p>
<p class="p4">To Estes, it’s important to do events like these because “cancer affects everyone.” He said he feels that student athletes “have a lot going for them,”so it’s important to help those who aren’t as fortunate.</p>
<p class="p4">Other sports teams came out to the event, including women’s volleyball and hockey. From the volleyball team, Shirin Tooloee ’18 bench pressed 75 lbs 25 times while a small crowd cheered her on.</p>
<p class="p4">“I feel good out here supporting a good cause for some of my good friends on the football team.” she said. “We had our ALS fundraiser last month and they supported us, so it was important to get my team out here and support as well.”</p>
<p class="p4">The football team has raised money under the name “Bench Press for Cancer” for ten years, but it originally began fundraising in 2004, when Lawrence Rubia ’04, team captain at the time, was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma. According to Head Coach Phil Estes P’18, the team was at first trying to offset costs for the Rubia family. After Rubia passed away in 2005, the team starting giving to the American Cancer Society, but decided later to focus their efforts on local patients, and began donating to Rhode Island’s Miriam Hospital. “We have a chance to see local people,” the coach said, stressing the importance of athletes who spend a lot of time in the limelight getting involved.</p>
<p class="p4">Dewey Jarvis ’17.5 agreed that it was important to get involved. Even though the event isn’t mandatory for players, everyone should come out because it is relatively easy “to find donors, buy a t-shirt, hang out and have fun,” he said. Jarvis has been to Miriam Hospital and met with the people who benefited from the team’s donations. He said he loved seeing how “they appreciated it so much.”</p>
<p class="p4">According to the team’s Crowdrise fundraising website, it hopes to raise $25,000, adding to the more than $100,000 they’ve already raised since 2004.</p>
<p class="p4">Four rowing machines lined the edge of the Main Green from 12 to 1 p.m. Wednesday for the Pull for a Cure event, Brown Crew’s annual Breast Cancer Fundraiser. The one day event precedes this weekend’s Head of the Charles Regattain Boston.</p>
<p class="p4">Similar to Bench Press for Cancer, the crew team drew participation from other Brown athletes who were looking to compete for a good cause. Both men’s hockey and lacrosse were represented at the event, forming teams to row against each other.</p>
<p class="p4">The competition quickly heated up, with one of the “erg” machines damaged within 15 minutes of the event’s start. Teammates quickly worked together to get feet in and out of velcro straps, while others urged the “rowers” to go faster and faster. Some participants even went so far as to fall off the machines while their feet were still strapped in.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’re here to win, (to) stomp out cancer.” said Luke Kania ’21, after he and some of his fellow hockey players took on the rowing machines themselves.</p>
<p class="p4">Funds raised from all the fun and games will be donated to the breast cancer research arm of the American Cancer Society. Dan Aziz ’11 started the fundraiser in 2009 when he was a junior on the men’s rowing team.</p>
<p class="p4">Aziz was inspired when a family friend — who saved him from drowning after he broke his neck in a childhood accident — was diagnosed with breast cancer. After learning that a fellow teammate lost his mother to breast cancer, Aziz came up with an idea: The Head of the Charles event in Boston, held each October, could be a venue to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</p>
<p class="p4">Up until 2009, the crew team wore “wacky costumes” to race in the event because the regatta didn’t count towards national standings. The team now shows up in colors to support breast cancer, after Aziz convinced Norman Alpert ’80, who rowed during his years at Brown, to buy everyone pink racing suits. By asking friends, family and alums, Aziz and the team were able to raise $25,000 that first fall.</p>
<p class="p4">Every year since, a group of juniors from both the men and women’s teams are responsible for organizing the event. For Claire Ryan ’19, who was one of this year’s organizers, the main goal of the event was awareness.</p>
<p class="p4">Jack Abeel ’19 of the men’s crew team emphasized the need for athletes to take advantage of their team’s organization and large size in doing philanthropic work. “You also have these huge networks of alumni who bought into the team and they want to help you succeed,” Abeel said.</p>
<p class="p4">For Aziz, looking back to the event’s conception,“It feels super great … initially I didn’t know it would take off and now it’s become a part of Brown’s tradition.”</p>
<p class="p4">Nine years since its conception, Aziz says he is excited to see how much bigger Pull for a Cure can get.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The women’s soccer team traveled to Cambridge Saturday, taking down the Crimson 1-0 for the first time in seven seasons. Goalkeeper Christine Etzel ’19, who made four saves in a full 90 minutes of play, earned her third shutout of the season. Incidentally, the match was also the first time Etzel has competed against her twin sister, Danielle, who played in Harvard’s net for half of Saturday’s match-up.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown’s win also made Etzel the sole possessor of third place on the program’s career shutouts list, an accomplishment that earned Etzel the distinction of The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: Congratulations on Saturday’s win. How does it feel to be third on Brown’s all-time shutout list?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Etzel: I did not even know that. It’s pretty cool. Obviously I’m going into every game looking for that shutout, making the biggest impact on the team I can. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>When did you first start playing soccer?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I’ve been playing as long as I can remember, as soon as I was in a rec-league. I feel like parents just throw their kids in, and my parents were actually my coach for my rec league. Me and my sister were on the same team.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Was there a moment when you realized you really liked the sport?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s always been soccer. I didn’t always play in goal: It’s funny, I made my first club team as a field player and then my coach put me and my sister both in goal, probably because we were the tallest ones on the team at the time. But it worked out. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Was it always your goal to reach collegiate level athletics?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yeah, … looking at schools, myfirst priority was academics, obviously, and soccer was kind of like that bonus. Looking at the Ivy Leagues, you get the best of both. I didn’t really want to give up any sports, I didn’t want to just stop my athletic career for college and I really like being a part of a team.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Both of your sisters are collegiate athletes — what is it like to be from such an athletically driven family? Does that inform your play at all?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Having a twin sister who played the same position … we were competitive … you kind of push each other to each other’s best potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So it was never a negative competition. My family is really close, so it was always more encouraging competition than any negative hostility.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How did it feel to play against your sister Saturday?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So weird! So weird. The past two years I haven’t actually played against her on the field, but I’ve seen her warm up. I remember my freshman year, just seeing her warm up on the other side of the field, I was so confused. I was preparing myself for it but it was still confusing because in my mind I was like, ‘She’s not on another team. She’s never been on another team.’ And then after the game, we’re the first ones to shake each others’ hand. So it was weird, but it was cool, too. Not many people can really say that they did that — played right against their sister — especially the same position. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The ability to be both academically and athletically driven — we get the best of both worlds there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the open curriculum really spoke to me. I really wanted to pursue my interests more in the sciences, so the opportunity to do that but also play soccer and get to take some other classes that I really wanted to was really exciting for me. From a soccer standpoint, I definitely wanted to come in, have an impact immediately … and help build the program a bit more.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What’s your favorite class that you’ve taken so far, either biology or not biology? </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I took a really cool class my freshman spring — it was (EDUC 0860:) “Sports in American Society.” It’s taught by Professor Hilary Levey Friedman. She was so cool! I remember the majority of the class was guys, and so you’d walk in, and some guy would always ask a question like ‘Oh, what about this?’ and she’d immediately be like, ‘I know the team, I know the names, I know all their stats.’ So I think all the guys were a bit shocked. … I thought that was pretty cool. And the content was very interesting. The whole class was how sports really impact the world, past, present and talking about the future.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What’s the best part about being a member of the soccer team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I can’t choose one thing. I really enjoy my position on the team, not only on the field but also off. I’ve always wanted to be as open as I can and have my teammates feel comfortable to talk to me. It’s really special that part of our team culture is that we do care about each other a lot.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What’s been your most memorable experience so far?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">You always think about big wins that you have as a team, or big moments, big saves or something on the field. It’s the little moments also that people forget about. When you graduate, you’re going to remember your record and the games you won, but you’re also going to remember your bus trips and smaller things like that. Those are the moments you remember the most.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How is the team feeling as it heads into the end of the regular season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Ivy League in general is so intense because you only play each team once. As a team, we’re very driven, and we just want the best outcome at the end of the year. That’s been the goal this week — just staying focused for the next couple of games, because it really doesn’t matter what place anyone is in the Ivy League.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have a team pump up song?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yeah … (laughs). We always play — what is it? “Outta Your Mind” by Lil Jon. That’s probably our team song. It gets us hyped before games.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Anything else you’d like to say?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s weird talking in an interview by yourself, because I’m not the only one on the team. So I don’t know, give a little shout-out to my teammates too. They’re awesome.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After finishing atop the American League East division for the second consecutive year, the Boston Red Sox has sent manager John Farrell packing. His resume with the Red Sox includes three division wins, a World Series Championship and two last-place finishes. With Farrell completely out of the picture, who will Dave Dombrowski, president of baseball operations, tap next for perhaps the most prestigious managerial position in baseball?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dombrowski was clear about his intention to fire Farrell after the Houston Astros knocked the Red Sox out of the Divisional Round of this year’s playoff. This marked consecutive years in which the Red Sox won the AL East but failed to advance to the second round of the playoffs. Just two days after their season-ending defeat, Dombrowski fired Farrell, who was five seasons into his role as the Sox’ skipper. To put that in perspective, the only Red Sox managers to stay in town longer than five years in the team’s history are Terry Francona (2004-2011) and Joe Cronin (1935-1947). When the team fails to meet its high annual expectations, as it did this season, something has to change. That change often comes in the form of a new manager. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recently, changing managers has brought new life to the Red Sox. The team fired Grady Little after he brought them to within a game of the World Series in 2003, and, in Terry Francona’s first season with the Red Sox the next year, the Red Sox won the World Series — its first in 86 years. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Again, in 2013, after the Sox ousted Bobby Valentine, John Farrell won a World Series with the team in his first campaign as manager. Though Farrell’s record with Boston is far from bad, shaking things up has proven effective in getting the team over the hump in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dombrowski, having fired Farrell so soon after the season, must act quickly to secure a new manager. The Red Sox have a two-year window to win, as many players in the team’s young core are coming up on the end of their contracts after 2019.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The time is now, and John Farrell was clearly not making the most out of the tools he was given. The weight of the club falls on Dombrowski’s shoulders as he is tasked with hiring a manager who can turn this team of could-be all-stars into World Series champions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the running for the position are three major candidates: Alex Cora, Brad Ausmus and Ron Gardenhire. The media briefly toyed with the possibilities of having former Red Sox captain Jason Varitek and current Red Sox infield coach Brian Butterfield fill the vacancies, but there has been no evidence of Dombrowski giving either a hard look. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Alex Cora played with the Red Sox from 2005-2008, helping the team win a championship in 2007. He is now the bench coach for the Houston Astros and is regarded as an asset within the organization. John Farrell struggled with the constant media pressure in Boston, but Cora may be better equipped after being a baseball analyst for ESPN for four years after retiring from the majors. At 42, Cora would be a young manager in his first season at the Major League level. With a city expecting a championship and only two seasoned clubhouse veterans to aid him, Alex Cora would be in for a roller coaster season. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Next on the list, Brad Ausmus is now without a job after the Detroit Tigers opted not to renew their now ex-manager’s contract past 2017. Dave Dombrowski was with the Tigers when the team hired Ausmus in 2014, and the two worked well together before Dombrowski departed in 2015. Ausmus also managed the Sox’s struggling pitcher David Price for a year, during which he recorded a 13-8 record and a 2.90 ERA. A safe choice, Ausmus would provide little spark for the underperforming Red Sox. But then again, maybe the Sox need someone to underthink things and just let them play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, Ron Gardenhire, the current Arizona Diamondbacks’ bench coach, met with Dave Dombrowski Wednesday. He brings experience to this role that neither Cora nor Ausmus have, having been a manager or coach in the Major League for 25 years. He managed the Minnesota Twins for thirteen years but definitely lost his touch towards the end. He has been compared to Terry Francona, who is slightly more hands-on than Farrell was, both in keeping players accountable and in creating a positive clubhouse atmosphere. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All three candidates have been interviewed, and, while Dombrowski has left open the possibility for more candidates to be considered, these are the frontrunners for now. The Red Sox would definitely like to act quickly so it can assemble the right cast of coaches to surround the new manager. But with a decision this weighty, I would not be surprised if Dombrowski takes until November to announce Farrell’s replacement. Regardless of who he hires, a change will do the Red Sox good. A fresh perspective on the lineup and a new face in the media will only benefit the team, whether it comes from Cora, Ausmus or Gardenhire.</span></p>

		<title>Grigo &#039;18: Breaking down Gary Sanchez’s playoff slump</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since he arrived in the big leagues at the beginning of August last season, the Yankees’ Gary Sanchez has been the best catcher in MLB, and it hasn’t really been close. Over the last two full seasons, only Buster Posey has accumulated more Wins Above Replacement than Sanchez: Posey<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>leads 8.3 to 7.6 by Fangraphs’ WAR, but he has also played in 111 more games. During that same time frame, Sanchez’s weighted runs created plus, a measure of offensive performance, is 142 — meaning he has performed 42 percent better than league average at the dish — while no other catcher with more than 200 plate appearances has produced a wRC+ over 129. And for all the worry about his defense, Sanchez rates well by defensive runs saved at throwing runners out, and he has only been a touch below league average according to Stat Corner’s pitch framing metric.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Games four and five of the ALCS notwithstanding, that success has not translated to the playoffs. Even counting his recent two-game outburst, Sanchez has posted an anemic 62 wRC+ in 11 postseason games — a disastrous 38 percent worse than league average — and he has only reached base in a little more than 20 percent of his plate appearances, a 14-percentage-point drop below his career rate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> Surprisingly, Sanchez’s batted ball profile in the playoffs has changed very little from the regular season. Per Baseball Savant, Sanchez’s average exit velocity is down just 1.6 mph in the postseason to 89.1 mph, and his average launch angle of 13.5 degrees is only .2 degrees higher than it was from April through September. Still, Sanchez ran up a robust .379 expected weighted on-base average — a metric that bases hitter performance off only strikeouts, walks, exit velocity and launch angle — during the regular season, a figure that has dipped to .286 through game five of the ALCS, according to Baseball Savant.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Given Sanchez’s quality of contact thus far in the playoffs, that difference can be attributed to his playoff strikeout and walk rates, both of which have moved in the wrong direction since October. Sanchez has walked in just 2.1 percent of his plate appearances this postseason compared to 7.6 percent<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in the regular season, and he has struck out in an Aaron Judge-like 36.2 percent of his plate appearances, up from his regular season rate of 22.9 percent.. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Pitchers have approached Sanchez differently in the playoffs, a factor that might be contributing to those unpleasant walk and strikeout trends. In the regular season, Sanchez saw 56.8 percent fastballs to go with 32.7 percent breaking balls, per MLB’s PITCHf/x data. So far in the postseason, pitchers have gone to a more even mix, throwing him just 48.7 percent fastballs along with 46.8 percent breakers. Considering Sanchez’s history, that adjustment might seem surprising. While he hit fastballs reasonably well during the regular season — ranking 52nd out of 144 qualified hitters in runs above average per 100 pitches against heaters — Sanchez thrived against sliders, ranking 33rd versus that pitch type, per Fangraphs’ pitch type linear weights model. Scouts must have looked at Sanchez’s dismal numbers against curveballs and decided to take their chances by throwing more breaking balls.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the most part, that strategy has worked. As of this morning, Sanchez’s whiff rate is up nine-percentage-points against sliders and four-percentage-points against curveballs for the playoffs, in part due to poor pitch selection on the part of the Yankees’ backstop. Through game four of the ALCS, Sanchez has swung at 50 percent of the breaking balls thrown to him outside the strike zone, a figure almost nine-percentage-points higher than his regular season chase percentage, according to numbers derived from MLB’s PITCHf/x data.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But it’s not just the pitch mix that has been different against Sanchez in the postseason — pitchers are attacking him with strikes more often, too. Postseason hurlers have thrown their breaking balls in the strike zone 55.6 percent of the time, a seven-percentage-point jump from their regular season percentage. And their fastballs have found the zone 56.1 percent of the time this postseason compared to less than half the time during the regular year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The graphics that accompany this article chart all the fastballs and breaking balls Sanchez has seen through game four of the ALCS, with the results of his swing attempts coded by shape. The charts show that pitchers have made many mistakes with both pitch types to him in the playoffs — Sanchez has simply failed to capitalize at his usual clip.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the breaking ball plot, you can see that most of Sanchez’s contact has come on breakers down and away, while he has swung through or fouled off hangers up and over the plate. And in the fastball plot, you’ll notice a cluster of swinging strikes and foul balls versus heaters in the middle horizontal third of the dish. The effect of missing those pitches is twofold: Not only does Sanchez lose the opportunity to punish a mistake by the pitcher, but also it puts him into a worse count for the remainder of the at-bat. This point might be helpful for understanding why Sanchez’s strikeout rate has spiked in the playoffs. By fouling off or whiffing on hittable pitches rather than putting them into play with authority, Sanchez has been working himself into pitcher’s counts where he’s less likely to be successful.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Of course, games four and five against the Houston Astros highlighted what Sanchez can be when he’s locked in and crushing mistakes. In game four, Sanchez sprayed a fastball over the plate to right-center for a two RBI double, and in game five he hammered a pair of loopy breakers for a single and a home run.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To close out the Astros and take down the winner of the NLCS in the World Series, the Yankees could use that version of Sanchez.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“What was really working for us offensively was playing on the ground — they had a lot of defenders behind the ball packing the 18-yard-box, so our plan was to kind of draw them out and try to keep switching it to get a chance to get a goal,” Story said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jennifer Caruso ’19 paced the Bears with four shots, while Megan Grant ’19 and Maclaine Lehan ’18 recorded three apiece.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We came out in the first half with a lot of energy,” Story said. “In the first 10 to 15 minutes, we were all over them, really just getting the ball down and moving it around, switching the play, switching the point of attack and going at them.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team delivered a solid defensive performance as a unit to secure the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The back line has done well the past couple of games, but it all starts if the offense works hard on defense all the way back,” Story said. “We’ve wanted those shutouts, and we didn’t get some of them earlier on. We’ve been working really hard to get back in the groove and make sure that that’s a priority.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In net, Christine Etzel ’19 made five saves to record her fourth shutout of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking ahead, the Bears seek to maximize offensive output by capitalizing on opportunities early in their final two games.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“What we can work on moving forward is putting our chances away when we get them,” Story said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saturday’s home duel against Penn will also serve as a stage for the team’s Senior Day celebrations, during which Bruno will honor the five members of its graduating class.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We definitely want to honor our seniors and all that they have done for the program, and really fight hard,” Story said. “We’re not letting up — we really want these last two wins in honor of our seniors and in honor of our season.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears host Penn at Stevenson-Pincince Field Saturday, before wrapping up their season at Yale Nov. 4. Brown will need wins in both games to remain in contention for the Ivy League title. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following a tie against Harvard last weekend, the men’s soccer team stayed on the road to face the Cornell Big Red in its fourth Ivy League match of the season. Brown was unable to get past Cornell’s strong defense and fell 1-0 in double overtime. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both Bruno (6-4-2, 1-2-1 Ivy) and the Big Red (7-5-2, 2-1-1) came into the game in a four-way tie for third place in the Ivy League with Yale and Harvard. With the overtime loss, the Bears fall into a three-way tie with Yale and Penn for fifth place. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“They took advantage of their moments and we failed to do so,” said Toby Howell ’19. “It hurts, but that’s the reality of this league.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The start of the game was marked by strong defense, with both squads unable to create a threatening scoring opportunity. In the 10th minute, Howell was able to slice through the defense in the 18-yard box and send a powerful shot that was barely saved by Big Red goalkeeper Mitchell Meyer. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the 17th minute, Tyler Bagley managed to lose his defensive marker and get loose with a great opportunity against Bears goalkeeper Joey Cipicchio ’18. But Bagley was unable to accurately place the shot and sent it high of the net, keeping the game knotted at zero. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At halftime, the game was still locked in a scoreless tie, with Bruno leading in shots 7-4. The half was extremely physical, as the teams combined for 11 fouls and each earned a yellow card. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The second half started similarly to the first, as neither side was able to generate a scoring opportunity. The Bears earned a few corner kicks that were all fiercely challenged by the Big Red defense. Quinn English ’18 was able to break through and send a shot toward goal, but it landed straight into the chest of Meyer for another save. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the second half continued, strong midfield play dominated the game, with both teams battling for possession between the 18-yard boxes. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the 76th minute, Caleb McAuslan sent a shot from the top right of the 18-yard box that the Bears’ defense managed to block to preserve the tie as overtime neared. After 90 minutes of hard-fought play, Brown led Cornell in shots 15-13 and shots on goal 6-2. Both teams combined for 22 fouls with Bruno receiving two yellow cards and the Big Red receiving one.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In overtime, Vardhin Manoj almost ended play with a volley directly in front of Cipicchio, but the Bears were able to recover and the game continued. Cornell dominated possession in the first overtime, but was unable to capitalize and finish off the Bears. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The second overtime was short-lived, as the Big Red used their momentum from the first overtime to score a mere minute into the second period. A cross from outside the 18-yard box created a scrum in front of the goal, allowing Ryan Hill to come out of the pack with the ball and end the game with a low-shot that squeaked past Cipicchio. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I can confidently say that no team will ever outwork us, so that’s something to hold on to moving forward,” Howell said. “We have to get better in front of the goal and that’s what we’ll be working on for the rest of the season. We’re not quitting.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will return home to Stevenson-Pincince Field Tuesday to face University of Massachusetts Lowell at 7 p.m. before continuing Ivy League play at home against Penn on Saturday at 7 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">After surprising first-place Yale by winning the first set comfortably, the volleyball team was unable to sustain early success, eventually falling three sets to one Friday night. Offensive contributions from Sabrina Stillwell ’19 and backcourt coverage by Melissa Cairo ’18 bolstered Brown (6-13, 1-7 Ivy), but could not help the team overcome numerous minor errors and dwindling energy down the stretch.</p>
<p class="p2">Though the Bulldogs (13-4, 7-1) currently top the Ivy League standings, the Bears exploded into the first set, taking a comfortable 15-7 lead on the momentum of two four-point streaks. In a complete turnaround from last weekend, Bruno made daring defensive plays to keep rallies alive and built its offense on solid passing and deceptive attacks. Yale almost started a comeback when they registered a three-point streak, but a strategic timeout by Brown Head Coach Diane Short refocused the Bears. Three powerful kills by Jacqueline Jacobs ’20, Courtney Palm ’19 and Stillwell wrapped up the set at 25-20 for Bruno.</p>
<p class="p2">The second set opened with the Bulldogs eager to level the playing field. Yale’s early 4-1 lead prompted a Brown timeout, after which Bruno closed the gap. The Bears gained their first lead since the opening point of the set at 19-18, but just a few rallies later, the Bulldogs reclaimed the lead at 21-20. Bruno briefly held off Yale at the first set point but the Bulldogs claimed the set, 25-23.</p>
<p class="p2">“The second game, I thought we let it go,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Short said. “We could have won that set. It opened the door for Yale. … Once they got a lead, they could be more aggressive against us. We fell behind and had trouble gaining momentum.”</p>
<p class="p2">That loss of momentum was evident in the third set. Though Brown stayed close to Yale and composed in their attacks at the start of the set, the Bears began to slip after a three-point streak put the Bulldogs ahead 9-5. Minor attack errors, balls hit just out of bounds and defensive miscommunications accumulated against Bruno’s favor. The set ended 25-12 to Yale.</p>
<p class="p2">The fourth set went quickly. Lack of coordination and physical exhaustion hindered the Bears, and Yale took advantage, delivering quick and well-placed kills and tips over the net. When Yale crossed the 20-point mark, Bruno rallied to earn six points, three from rookie outside hitter Gabrielle Moriconi ’21 on a service ace and two kills. But the push was too little, too late, as Yale claimed the set 25-11 to clinch the win.</p>
<p class="p2">“When you’re playing down, you get a little timid, which is always hard,” said Stillwell, who led the team with 14 kills in the match. “We just need to remain confident towards the end of the game and know that we need to be aggressive, be strong.”</p>
<p class="p2">Brown will continue Ivy League play by traveling to Penn Friday and Princeton Saturday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Seven points, six first downs and 161 total yards of offense were all the football team managed in the Bears’ (2-3, 0-3 Ivy) 34-7 loss to fourth-ranked Cornell Saturday. A fourth-quarter touchdown by tight end Anton Casey ’19 prevented the shutout, but it wasn’t enough as Brown fell to the Big Red (2-4, 2-1) for the first time since 2007.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was poor execution, especially on the offensive side of the ball,” Casey said. “We got a little bit frantic early on, and that caused us to kind of fall apart and not execute throughout the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the second straight week, Bruno’s defense allowed more than 500 yards as Cornell made four trips to the end zone. The Big Red jumped to an early lead with a field goal on its first offensive drive and remained in control for the entire game, maintaining possession for 40 minutes and holding Brown to 18 total rushing yards. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Bears were able to make offensive progress through the air, amassing 143 passing yards on 11 completions. Jeffrey “Mitchell” Jonke ’21 started at quarterback but was injured late in the first quarter, resulting in the reappearance of Nicholas Duncan ’19. Duncan had not recorded playing time since Brown’s week-one victory over Bryant University due to an injury, but generated an offensive spark late in the game that led to Bruno’s sole TD.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With 11 minutes left in the final quarter, Duncan and Casey pieced together an 80-yard, six-play scoring drive. Duncan found the tight end for a pair of 24-yard completions to storm into Cornell territory. A 23-yard reception by Demitri Jackson ’20 put Bruno in the red zone for the first time, and Duncan’s shovel pass to Casey gave Brown its first TD in seven quarters. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite Casey’s clutch receptions and first career touchdown, the Bears could not overcome the Big Red’s lead, settling the final score at 34-7. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There’s a lot of question marks on offense in terms of who’s starting every week,” Casey said. “We’re just trying to find a groove right now. … We’re trying to get our confidence back and look to turn things around.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown is winless in the Ivy League but looks to change that Saturday against Penn. The Bears will return to Brown Stadium to face off against the Quakers (2-4, 0-3) for their final home game of the season before traveling to Yale Nov. 3 and meeting Dartmouth at Fenway Park for a neutral-site game Nov. 10.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The women’s basketball team followed up its tough home loss against the nationally-ranked University of California at Berkeley with a trip to the Golden State to play in the University of the Pacific’s Turkey Tip-Off Tournament. Brown advanced to the championship game after a 73-66 victory over Hampton University in the first round and then defeated the hosts 74-57 to claim the crown.</p>
<p class="p2">“Going into it, everyone was really excited,” said co-captain Erika Steeves ’19. “The tournament was very competitive, so we had a chance to prove ourselves.”</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Brown 73, Hampton 66</b></p>
<p class="p2">The Bears (4-1, 0-0 Ivy) opened their tournament run by holding off the Pirates (2-3) Friday afternoon. Hampton took an early seven-point lead, but Bruno bounced back after<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an offensive run that brought the team within one point of the Pirates at the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p class="p2">Steeves went on to record her first double-double of the season, accounting for 16 points and a career-high 19 rebounds.</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno took over in the second frame, riding a 14-2 scoring run highlighted by three-pointers from Steeves and Shayna Mehta ’19 to outscore the Pirates by 11 in the quarter. Justine Gaziano ’20 added another three and a last-minute layup to give Brown a 35-25 edge at the half.</p>
<p class="p2">Gaziano led the team in scoring with 21 points and was automatic from the free-throw line, hitting a perfect 10 for 10. As a whole, the team netted over 82 percent of its free throw attempts.</p>
<p class="p2">Defensively, the Bears showed improvements from their previous games, nabbing 34 rebounds — seven more than they averaged across their first three contests — and holding Hampton to zero fast break points.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown maintained its lead in the second half, but the Pirates fought hard for the comeback and cut their deficit to 59-57in the final five minutes. Bruno relied on experienced starters to preserve the advantage.</p>
<p class="p2">“Coach Behn has been really big on leadership from our veterans this year because it’s the first year that we really have solid leadership from the older girls,” Steeves said. “At the end of the game, that’s when it really showed that we were more mature. In past years, that’s where we would have caused some turnovers and maybe allowed Hampton to take the lead. In the last minutes of the game, that’s when our veterans stepped up, and we stayed composed.”</p>
<p class="p2">That composure resulted in an 8-0 spurt that extended Bruno’s lead, and, as Brown held Hampton scoreless for 4:34, Gaziano drained six free throws in the final 48 seconds to secure the victory.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Brown 74, Pacific 57</b></p>
<p class="p2">With the Turkey Tip-Off title on the line, Bruno took to the court Saturday with a clear goal.</p>
<p class="p2">“The biggest thing was proving ourselves,” Steeves said. “As a team that is invited to a tournament and then playing that host team on (its) home court, some would count that as a disadvantage to us, but we went into it with an attack mentality. … We didn’t come into it scared.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears took an early lead and stayed on top for nearly 39 minutes of the 40-minute game, dominating the Tigers (3-2) on their home court. Pacific posted 106 points in its first game of the tournament, but Brown held the hosts to only 27.1 percent shooting and outshot them 34-20 in the paint during the championship game.</p>
<p class="p2">Taylor Will ’19 opened the game with a pair of layups and scored eight of Bruno’s initial 10 points en route to a game-high 23 points. Matching threes from Mehta and Kathleen Ryan ’20 gave Brown an 18-10 edge, and a buzzer-beater by Mehta put the Bears up 21-13 at the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p class="p2">Steeves made her presence known in the second stanza, nailing a 17-foot jumper and tallying five of her game-high 14 rebounds on her way to a second double-double.</p>
<p class="p2">The Tigers crept within eight points of the Bears in the final minutes of the half, but Brown held its lead and went into the locker room up 40-32.</p>
<p class="p2">Will continued her hot streak in the second half, netting six of the eight points Bruno tallied in the opening minutes. After a late three-pointer by Will, Mehta scored Brown’s final five points of the third to give the Bears a 58-41 lead going into the last quarter.</p>
<p class="p2">Three layups from forward Janie White ’18 and a pair of free throws by Steeves put the Bears up by 21 with 4:40 left on the clock. As the Tigers scrambled for a comeback in the final minutes, Herald staff columnist Randi Richardson ’20 and co-captain Megan Reilly ’18 added a layup and two free throws respectively to settle the final score at 74-57 and clinch the victory.</p>
<p class="p2">“It shows a lot of promise for when we do get to the Ivy League games,” Steeves said. “It was a really promising team effort, and we’re all excited to get back into it.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears return home to host the College of the Holy Cross Wednesday at 7:00 p.m. before taking on Providence College in the first round of the Ocean State Tip-Off Tournament Dec. 2.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s water polo team traveled to Santa Clara, California to compete in the Julian Fraser Memorial Tournament last weekend. Led by Tyler Kirchberg ’18, the Bears defeated California Baptist University, Loyola Marymount University, Santa Clara University and Fresno Pacific University. Kirchberg accounted for 13 of Brown’s 43 total goals, eight of which came in the fourth quarter of overtime, and totaled six assists and 14 steals in the process. In the victory over Fresno Pacific, he recorded a game-high five goals, netting one for the win in the final 50 seconds to keep Bruno undefeated in California. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to receiving Brown Student-Athlete of the Week honors, Kirchberg was also recognized as the Northeast Water Polo Conference Co-Player of the Week. For his leadership in the pool and clutch performances over the weekend, Kirchberg has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Herald: How did you first get into water polo?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kirchberg: I got into water polo when I was about 12. I actually started swimming when I was a lot younger than that and swam on a recreational summer team. I wanted to get faster at swimming and all the water polo players I knew who were on that rec team were really, really fast. So I was like, “Alright, I’ll give it a try.” I had been playing baseball, so it kind of integrated swimming and baseball. I always stuck with swimming, though more on a recreational level. I swam on my high school team over the summer, but I played water polo year round starting my freshman year of high school. That’s when I really committed to the sport. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Congratulations on going 4-0 this weekend. How did that feel?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was great! Looking back, I think it was a little unexpected because the games were all really close, and they all could have gone either way. The last game we played — Fresno Pacific — we weren’t winning until the last 50 seconds of the game. The entire game was exciting. It was a battle. We were down the whole time, and it was pretty much like that for each individual game. Right up until the last buzzer sounded, it was pretty up in the air who would come out as the winner. I think it was really good for our team to go 4-0. It was really exciting and good for us to battle back from a lot of those games that were close, and come out victorious. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Your final season of water polo at Brown is coming to a close. Do you have any personal aspirations?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a senior, my personal goals are just to keep contributing as I have but also encourage a lot of the younger guys to step into the roles I think everyone on the team knows they can fill. It’s a big step going from high school and club water polo up to the collegiate level. … Just helping to make those guys comfortable while they’re playing and giving them the confidence they need to do well while they’re in is definitely something I’m going to try to do toward the end of this season. And just enjoying it while I have my last few games of water polo left. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What are the team’s goals?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We have two more weekends of conference games — one this weekend and next weekend. We’d love to go 5-0 with the rest of our conference games and put us in a really good spot for our conference tournament that’s coming up in about a month. The goal is always to win the conference tournament. When I was a freshman, we ended up winning that, which gave us a berth to the NCAA tournament. The past two years, we’ve been really close. We lost in the championship last year and in the semi-finals the year before, so we’re always hovering around that first, second, third place spot. This year, I think if our team comes together like we did this past weekend, it will be a really exciting tournament. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Looking back, what has been your most memorable moment?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s definitely a few that come to mind. Winning my freshman year was really incredible. That was a really fun experience and kind of unexpected. We were the underdogs, and it was a really great way to start off my water polo career at Brown. Overall, just being with each team has been different because the team has had a different personality each year depending on who’s on it. But each year there’s different small things like dinners and bus rides that are really, really fun and fond memories that I look back on. We’ve had team success, but it’s definitely just being with the guys on the team that’s been the most memorable. I’ll miss playing, and it’s fun to compete, but what I’ll probably miss the most is the team camaraderie we have. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What has been your favorite class you’ve taken so far?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There have been a few. I study biology, so I really liked Genetics. It was a pretty intense class, but I liked it a lot. I also really liked The Digital World just because I have no experience with CS, and I thought it was an awesome introduction. … Probably my favorite class I’ve taken is called Emergency Medical Systems. I’m pre-med looking to go to medical school after graduation, and this class was taught by two ER physicians who worked down at Rhode Island Hospital. Part of the class involved shadowing at the hospital, so that was a really cool experience. I got to go down there, hang out with an ER physician for about four hours two times during the semester and got to really just be thrown into the craziness of an ER and see it firsthand. That was really cool because that’s a profession that I want to end up doing. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The water polo team will be back in action Saturday as they host the Ivy Club Championship and gear up for the NWPC Championship. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein ’20: Finding a favorite in the mediocre NFL</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This NFL season has been filled with chaos. Injuries have hindered a number of contending teams — Aaron Rodgers, J.J. Watt, Odell Beckham Jr., Julian Edelman, Eric Berry, David Johnson, Carson Palmer, Dalvin Cook and Sam Bradford all went down with lengthy or season-ending setbacks. These injures have left a few absolutely terrible teams, a few pretty good teams and a giant glut of middle-tier teams battling one another for the honor of a quick wildcard weekend exit from the playoffs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In a year of such parity, it has been difficult for teams to separate themselves from that middle pack. The injury bug seems to hit every time a squad takes steps to reach championship contender status. With that being said, there are a few teams that appear ready for lengthy playoff runs — but is there one single “best” team in the league?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Los Angeles Rams (5-2) have been possibly the NFL’s biggest surprise so far. After years of sub-.500 finishes, including last season’s disastrous 4-12 mark, and a move from St.Louis, expectations had never been lower coming into 2017. Yet Jared Goff has emerged as a solid, if not spectacular, NFL quarterback, with nine passing touchdowns to only four interceptions through seven games. Those numbers represent significant strides from his struggle-filled rookie year, when some eager critics declared him a bust. Running back Todd Gurley, meanwhile, has been one of the best offensive players in the league. He is on pace for 1,433 rushing yards, 11 rushing touchdowns, 670 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns. For the first time in quite a while, the Rams’ offense must be respected.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But even with all the excitement surrounding the Rams, there are still a few weaknesses that could doom this team. The receiving core continues to be a problem. Sammy Watkins has under-performed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Robert Woods falls far short of being a legitimate number one wideout. Goff, while providing effective game management, still has not proven that he can take over games and be a star. The defense is fantastic and improving — they shut out the Arizona Cardinals last week — but the offense could start to stagnate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Philadelphia Eagles are another surprising team. They currently hold the NFL’s best record (6-1), and are showing no signs of slowing down. Quarterback Carson Wentz, also in the second season of his career, is an MVP candidate — he is on pace for 4,223 passing yards, 39 touchdowns and only nine interceptions. Last week’s contest against the Washington Redskins, in which he threw for four touchdowns on 268 yards and rushed for another 63, may have been his finest performance yet. LeGarrette Blount has been terrific so far, bulldozing defenders for a 5.0 yards per carry average, and tight end Zach Ertz is a breakout performer.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But the Eagles have similar issues as the Rams. For how long can they continue to exceed expectations? Left tackle Jason Peters and middle linebacker Jordan Hicks are both out for the season after leaving Monday night’s game with serious injuries. The loss of Peters is an especially tough blow for the Eagles — the nine-time Pro Bowler was a defensive mainstay and leader. Philadelphia will have to survive the injury bug (with Darren Sproles already on injured reserve) to hold their present position in the NFC.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Moving over to the AFC, the Kansas City Chiefs (5-2) were NFL darlings over the first couple of weeks, but have fallen back to earth since then. Rookie running back Kareem Hunt has already established himself as one of the league’s foremost talents. Through only seven games, he has already rushed for 717 yards on a brilliant 5.8 yards per carry average. Quarterback Alex Smith is on track for the best season of his career, with a sparkling 15 touchdowns and zero (that’s right, zero) interceptions. He is another MVP candidate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At some point, though, the magic has to wear off for Smith. It would be an unprecedented achievement for a 33-year-old quarterback to have his best season by a wide margin in his 13th year. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kansas City lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers and Oakland Raiders in their past two games. They need to defeat the Denver Broncos next Monday night before we anoint them as the best of the AFC.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is no surprise, on the other hand, to see the New England Patriots (5-2) back around the top. After a few weeks of widespread panic about New England’s defense, Pats fans watched Sunday night’s demolition of the Atlanta Falcons with glee. The Falcons scored only one touchdown, which came late in the fourth quarter of the blowout. The Patriots suddenly look like themselves again. Tom Brady has been his usual self all along, throwing for 15 touchdowns and two interceptions. Wide receiver Brandin Cooks and tight end Rob Gronkowski have been as solid as expected. If Gronkowski can escape the regular season without injury, which is no small feat for him, the Patriots will enter the playoffs with a loaded offense.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If the defensive improvement holds up and the injury bug does not hit Brady like it did Aaron Rodgers and Carson Palmer, we have our Super Bowl favorites in Foxborough. The path in the AFC is clear. As much as it hurts to say it, New England is well on track to yet another championship.</span></p>

		<title>Blasberg ’18: How to fix the problem with college sports</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Jayson Tatum was born in St. Louis, Missouri in March of 1998. He attended high school at Chaminade College Preperatory School in Creve Coeur, Missouri, where he excelled on the varsity basketball team. A highly touted recruit, he went on to play college basketball at Duke University, one of the most prestigious colleges in the nation. After just one year at Duke, Jayson declared for the NBA draft and was selected third overall by the Boston Celtics. Last Wednesday he played before a sellout crowd in Cleveland on national television. Jayson’s young life and basketball career beg the question: was his year at Duke necessary?</p>
<p class="p3">The NBA and the NFL force their future athletes to masquerade as students before entering the draft. In a 2005 collective bargaining agreement, the NBA limited entrance into the league to players over 19 or those who have finished their freshman year of college. To enter the NFL draft, players must be at least three years out of high school. As a result, many of our nation’s best basketball and football players treat college as nothing more than a mandatory stop before they can punch their ticket to the pros. Top college teams serve both as a training ground and a showcase for young athletes, but not as educational institutions. Members of elite college basketball and college football teams are essentially full-time athletes, who have neither the opportunity nor incentive to reach their full academic potential.</p>
<p class="p3">The nation’s elite athletes should not be developing their skills in college. The United States needs a more robust framework of semi-professional sports leagues for young athletes who intend on entering the NBA or NFL to develop and showcase their skills.</p>
<p class="p3">Do I want to abolish college sports? No. Athletics contribute enormously to school spirit and pride. By teaching physical fitness, discipline and teamwork, competitive athletics complement academic course work to provide a well-rounded education. The way many college sports in America are played now, though, distorts the mission and purpose of these schools. The goal is no longer to educate. It is to entertain.</p>
<p class="p3">Semi-professional development leagues would give athletes the chance to focus on their craft and showcase their abilities with more freedom without worrying about staying eligible for NCAA competition. They also would not have to hide behind the veil of amateurism that the NCAA has set forth. They could receive a fair market wage for their labor, which college athletes do not.</p>
<p class="p3">Baseball and hockey already have unaffiliated minor leagues that serve as intermediate steps for players leaving high school seeking the chance to play at the next level. These leagues range from amateur to professional all around the country. As a result, the college experience for student athletes in these sports is much more legitimate because the players in college have made the choice to be there.</p>
<p class="p3">In the famous words of former Ohio State quarterback, Cardale Jones, “We come here to play football, we ain’t come here to play school.” Why make the most promising young athletes “play school” past high school? The country’s top basketball and football players should not be forced to go to college. Rather, they should be able to enter a development league where they can get paid and showcase their skills to the major professional leagues. College athletics and intercollegiate games would still exist, but top prospects would not be forced to attend for just one year when they have no intention of earning a degree.</p>

		<title>Bears to open season with home-and-home series against Yale</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the first time in nearly 250 days, the men’s hockey team will bring a dormant arena to life when it skates out onto home ice this weekend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will open the season with a home-and-home series against Ivy League rival Yale, traveling to New Haven tonight before hosting the Bulldogs at Meehan Auditorium Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This weekend’s duels follow a month and a half of preparation on and off the ice. The Bears first laced up their skates in early September and have been consistent in training leading up to regular season competition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The preseason has been positive,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “The guys have been tremendous in terms of focusing on the process and getting better each and every day.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno seeks to improve on its last place Eastern College Athletic Conference finish in the 2016-17 season<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with a new host of upperclassmen leadership. The team will benefit from the return of its six top scorers from the 2016-17 season, including Charlie Corcoran ’18, who led the Bears with a team-high 15 goals. Captain Josh McArdle ’18 and assistant captains Tyler Bird ’18 and Sam Lafferty ’18 have worked to set an example and establish good habits among the younger members of the team, Whittet said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The seniors have been unbelievable,” Whittet said. “What we stressed with the older guys is just having certain standards. As long as they exhibit them each and every day … that trickles down to the younger guys, and they understand what Brown hockey is about.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Everyone who’s younger than us can look up to us on any given day, and really look up and see someone that’s exuding the passion and the energy and the love for hockey,” said McArdle, who served as an assistant captain last year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno also welcomes the addition of eight new first-year players, including five forwards, two defensemen and one goaltender. The freshman class has demonstrated talent and industry in the preseason and has integrated quickly with the team, Lafferty said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“From the start, they’ve been part of our family,” said Lafferty, who also donned an assistant captain badge in 2016-17. “Their performance has been very impressive and we’re going to rely on all of the guys this year to produce.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They bring a lot to the table, they’re really skilled, they have a lot of experience, and they’ve played in some good leagues coming in here,” Bird said. “It creates a little competition too. ... We’re a little deeper in terms of skill that we haven’t had before, so they certainly add a lot to that.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This newfound depth of talent across lines is a source of optimism for the team, particularly as it seeks to maximize offensive output.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have very good depth across our entire team, and that’s a huge strength,” Lafferty said. “We have guys that are going to be able to pick each other up and get the job done no matter what.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears are slated to play 29 games in the regular season before playoff competition opens in March. While an ECAC championship crown would prove a satisfying feat, Bruno remains focused on everyday processes of improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s a certain amount of effort, energy and focus that goes into that day-to-day process that will allow you to accomplish goals at the end of the year,” Whittet said. “Our goal is to be a better team when we step off the ice today after practice than when we stepped on. That’s it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By concentrating on incremental developments in technique, the Bears seek to take the ice with presence and poise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We don’t want to look too far ahead,” McArdle said. “We’d like to be playing at home in the playoffs, but we’re focused on day-to-day goals — trying to come to the rink every day, have a really good practice, enjoy being there and enjoy being with each other. That’s going to produce really good hockey.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears face off against the Bulldogs Saturday at 7 p.m. at Meehan Auditorium.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Volleyball falls in back-to-back losses to Penn, Princeton 3-0</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The volleyball team lost three sets to zero against both Penn and Princeton over the weekend,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>leaving Brown (6-15, 1-9 Ivy) with only four contests left in the season to snap its current five-game losing streak.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Avoiding a repeat of their most recent match against Yale, the Bears never gave the Quakers (10-9, 5-5) a chance to let down their guard Friday. A 5-0 run by Brown quickly decimated Penn’s early lead, and it wasn’t until a last-minute 4-0 run by Penn that the Quakers clinched the first set. Though Brown surged ahead in the second set, Penn leveled with a 7-1 run, after which the Bears slipped into a four-point deficit that they could not overcome, dropping the set 25-12. No team had a lead larger than three points in the third and final set, but Penn ultimately took the game 25-23 to claim the match. In the contest, captain and libero Melissa Cairo ’18 had a match-high three service aces.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I thought we competed well all three sets,” said Head Coach Diane Short. “We didn’t win, but it was one of our better, compete-from-the-beginning-to-the-end matches.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Princeton also (14-6, 7-3) entered Saturday’s match hoping to bounce back from a difficult loss. Bruno had a strong first set, staying nearly point-for-point with the Tigers for its duration. A three-point streak by the Bears, powered by two kills from Eliza Grover ’21, brought the score within one at 22-23. But a Princeton timeout stalled Bruno’s momentum and the Tigers took the set 25-23.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second set was considerably tougher for Brown, as the Bears fell behind 13-3 on seven near-consecutive kills by Princeton. A Brown timeout helped the Bears reset and keep within 10 points of the Tigers, but 23-14 was the closest Bruno came to equalizing the set,which Princeton claimed 25-14.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 10-minute regroup between sets helped the Bears start the third set strongly, responding to the Tigers’ 3-0 opening by retaking the lead with a 5-1 streak. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But after a 5-1 Princeton run put the Tigers ahead 14-8, Bruno again could not close the gap down the stretch. Princeton took the set 25-17 to win the match at 3-0.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The record might be bleak, but Coach Short believes in her team. “We are playing better. … (Emma Chow ’21) is bringing a lot of energy. She really celebrates when others do well, and that’s always good for chemistry. … Defensively, we did well. Melissa Cairo had a nice weekend.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With four matches left in the season, the team is looking for a final positive push. “We just gotta keep fighting and being competitive,” Coach Short said. “It’s the kind of game where you have to change things and keep adapting throughout the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown will host Dartmouth for its next match Friday at 7 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The men’s cross-country team locked horns with the rest of the Ivy League at the 2017 Heptagonal Championships, held Friday in the Bronx’s historic Van Cortlandt Park. Despite mounting a late-race rally, which saw them rise as high as sixth in the team standings, the Bears failed to improve upon last year’s seventh-place finish. In the final tally, Bruno recorded a score of 164 points, beating out only Harvard. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was a little disappointing the way things turned out,” said captain Martin Martinez ’18. “We didn’t have a specific place in mind, but we thought we could place a lot higher than we did.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The race at the front of the pack boiled down to a brawl between Lions and Tigers. Columbia’s Ryan Thomas edged out Princeton’s Noah Kauppila by less than two seconds to capture the individual crown, but Princeton emerged triumphant in the team category, besting their big-city rival 28 to 43. Defending champion Penn was a distant third with 91 points. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears’ result belied their strong performances against Ivy League opponents during the regular season. In September, Brown trounced Dartmouth and Harvard at the Battle in Beantown; in October, Bruno again defeated Dartmouth — and scalped Yale for good measure — at the Pre-National Invitational. But only the Crimson finished behind the Bears Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Injuries to key personnel severely hampered Bruno’s efforts. Brown lost its number-one runner, captain Matt Mahoney ’18, to a stress fracture in September. Then, Mike Wyman ’18 — first for the Bears in their last meet of the regular season — fell victim to shin pain during the championship race itself, forcing him to drop out before the three-mile mark.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In lieu of Mahoney or Wyman, Martin Martinez ’18 led Brown over the five-mile course, clocking a time of 25:34. The senior captain started out aggressively and clung tightly to the leaders, clawing his way up to 10th<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as the race neared its conclusion. But Martinez lost ground to kicking competitors over the final half mile, falling to 20th place overall.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I put myself where I wanted to be in the race early on, and I was there coming off of Cemetery Hill,” Martinez said. “With about a (kilometer) to go, I just didn’t really have it in my legs. I think I hadn’t really recovered from my race at (the Pre-National Invitational).”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the second time this season, Gabe Altopp ’20 was Brown’s second man over the line, crossing in 25:53. Altopp hovered around 30th place throughout the race and ultimately netted 30 points for the Bears. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno’s third man, Andrew Foerder ’18, followed Altopp with a time of 26:04 — good for 36 points. Four seconds later, Dan McDonald-Meteer ’18 contributed an additional 38 points to Brown’s tally. Lastly, Cam Daly ’20, who had plummeted downwards through the pack from a peak position of 16th place, capped off the score with 41 points. Daly’s time was 26:14.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Cam is a competitor —He was grinding,” Martinez said. “It wasn’t a matter of effort. ... He just wasn’t quite feeling it yesterday.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will return to competition at the NCAA Northeast Regional on Friday, Nov. 10. The meet will afford Bruno a rematch against every team in the Ivy League except for Penn and Princeton. Martinez said that the team is looking forward to the race, which will take place over a distance of 10 kilometers, rather than 5 miles.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Guys are motivated. Things didn’t go quite the way we wanted at Heps, but we have another opportunity in two weeks to beat all the teams that beat us — and we’re hoping to beat some other teams, too.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The men’s soccer team faced the Penn Quakers Saturday at home in a matchup of two teams tied for fourth in the Ivy League standings. Going into the game, Brown (8-4-2, 2-2-1 Ivy) had not secured a conference win in three weeks. But the Bears’ clutch scoring lifted them to a 2-1 overtime victory against the Quakers (3-11-1, 1-3-1). Nico Lozada ’18 scored the game-winning goal to move zBruno into a second place tie in the Ivy League with Columbia and Cornell.</p>
<p class="p2">“It was more of a fight than pretty soccer,” Lozada said. “I would say that it was our work ethic that trumped them.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Quakers started the game fast, as Sam Wancowicz managed to launch a shot from the top right corner of the 18-yard box in the fifth minute, forcing a dive from goalkeeper Joey Cipicchio ’18. The powerful shot appeared on target, but turned wide of the net at the last second. The Bears had a promising opportunity in the 14th minute when Gabe Welp ’18.5 corralled a corner kick mere feet from the goal, but a Penn defender managed to take control and direct the ball out of bounds.</p>
<p class="p2">In the 25th minute, Toby Howell ’19 was able to find the ball behind the defense in the 18-yard box, but he was unable to get a shot off as the Penn defense held strong and cleared the ball.</p>
<p class="p2">Quinn English ’18 managed to break the ice to give the Bears a 1-0 lead with only 8.8 seconds left in the first half for his third goal of the season. English rocketed a low shot from about 20 yards outside of the goal that managed to sneak past Penn goalkeeper Scott Forbes and shock a Quaker team that looked ready for halftime.</p>
<p class="p2">The first half was marked by strong teamwork on the defensive end, limiting accurate midfield passing and scoring opportunities. At the half, the Bears held a one-goal advantage and led the Quakers 3-2 in shots and 4-1 in corner kicks. Bruno did not commit a first half foul, while the Quakers were called for nine.</p>
<p class="p2">The start of the second half was quiet, as neither team created an opportunity with a realistic chance to score. In the 67th minute, Bruno launched a free kick into the 18-yard box and hoped for a header. Forbes was forced to come out of his box and sky above everyone to punch the ball away.</p>
<p class="p2">In the 69th minute, the Quakers managed to respond on a counterattack and tie the game at one. Wancowicz scored an almost identical goal to English’s from the top right side of the 18-yard box on an assist from Brandon Bartel.</p>
<p class="p2">Lozada nearly gave the Bears the lead in the 78th minute on a wide-open header that was misdirected out of bounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With only four minutes left in the game, the Bears had two opportunities that required Forbes to make diving saves on shots that would have been game-winning goals. At the end of regulation, Brown led in 7-6 shots and 6-1 in corners.</p>
<p class="p2">In the second minute of overtime, the Bears believed they had won the game on a shot by Howell that found the back of the net, but the goal was called back for offsides. Penn almost scored on a counterattack moments later, but the cross into the 18-yard box was slightly off target.</p>
<p class="p2">With just 34 seconds left in the first period of overtime, English placed a cross into the middle of the 18-yard box directly in front of Lozada, who launched a precise shot into the top right corner of the net to win the game for the Bears. Bruno finished the game leading 10-9 in shots and 8-1 in corner kicks.</p>
<p class="p2">“(Scoring the game-winner) feels amazing,” Lozada said. “Last year we got beaten in overtime and it felt good to give them one back.”</p>
<p class="p2">Brown will return to the pitch on Tuesday at Hofstra before continuing Ivy League play on Saturday at Yale. The Bears will need to win both of their remaining Ivy League games, including against first-place Dartmouth in the final week of the season, to remain in contention for the conference title.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In its opening weekend, the men’s hockey team prevailed over Ivy rival Yale for the first time since 2014 with a 4-1 victory in New Haven Friday. The Bears recorded a pair of mixed decisions in the series, falling to the Bulldogs 5-2 at home Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brent Beaudoin ’20 led Bruno (1-1, 1-1 ECAC) with a pair of goals for the weekend and starting goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 recorded a career-high 44 saves in Friday’s matchup.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 4, Yale 1</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Friday night, first-period goals from Zach Giuttari ’20 and Alec Mehr ’21 gave the Bears an early advantage. Giuttari fired a shot from the point past Yale (1-1, 1-1) goaltender Sam Tucker at the 10 minute mark, before Mehr knocked the puck into the net off the crossbar five minutes later.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite being outshot by a margin of 45-25, Bruno was able to establish offensive integrity in the zone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were attacking from the get-go,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “Even though we got outshot, I thought a lot of those shots were perimeter shots.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yale answered early in the second frame, when Phil Kemp found the back of the net with a shot from in front of the blue line. But Bruno prevailed,as Beaudoin and captain Josh McArdle ’18 added empty net goals in the final minute of the third to secure the lead.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the crease, Nieto shut the Bulldogs down, recording a game-high 17 saves in the second stanza. He was awarded the game’s first star for his performance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 2, Yale 5</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The following day, the Bears were unable to recover from an early deficit despite goals from assistant captain Tyler Bird ’18 and Beaudoin.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After a goal from Brett Jewell put the Bulldogs on the board late in the first period, Bird capitalized on a power play early in the second to equalize the game. Bird collected a sliding pass from Max Willman ’18 and slotted the puck past Tucker on his stick side.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beaudoin responded to another Yale tally with a wraparound goal two minutes into the final stanza. But the Bulldogs recorded a trio of unanswered goals, including an empty netter in the last minute, to put the game out of reach for the Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They were throwing everything out of the zone right away,” Beaudoin said. “That just causes a tough time for us because if we have guys that get caught up in the play, then they automatically have an odd man rush coming back against us. That’s where a lot of their offense came from.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nieto made 22 saves in the loss as Yale outshot Brown 27-22.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno demonstrated command of its penalty kill, holding Yale at 0 for 12 on the power play over the weekend. Looking forward, the Bears seek to achieve clean execution and vigor in specialty teams play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The kill was good this weekend,” Whittet said. “On the converse side, our power play guys have to understand how hard they have to work in order to come up with pucks, to get pucks through and to not allow them to clear pucks and eliminate zone time on that (penalty kill).”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For us this year, specialty teams is a big emphasis,” Beaudoin said. “Power play has been good — we were lucky to capitalize today and yesterday for the limited amount of power plays we’ve actually had, and penalty kill has been very good for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mentally, Whittet emphasized the need for resilience and simplicity on the ice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We shouldn’t over-complicate it,” Whittet said. “It’s winning puck battles, winning races, defending hard, moving the puck north quickly. … You’ve just got to play a gritty game and we’re going to grow from it. We’ll get better. We’ve got to understand that it is a process.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday’s win serves as a source of optimism as Bruno enters the bulk of its season with conviction and composure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We know that we can come out and win games — we’ve got a confidence that we didn’t really have last year,” Beaudoin said. “A big thing for us is staying positive this year, making sure that we control the things we can control. You can control how hard you work, and you can control your systems.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears visit Dartmouth and Harvard this weekend, before hosting Clarkson Nov. 10.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A season-best performance by Brown’s defense and a late first-quarter touchdown weren’t enough to put the football team on top, as it fell 17-7 to Penn in its final home game of the season Saturday. Bruno (2-5, 0-4 Ivy) held the Quakers (3-4, 1-3) to 303 yards but gave up 65 yards in penalties and fumbled twice in the first half. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The only team that can beat Brown is Brown,” said Head Coach Phil Estes P’18. “Brown is beating itself right now. Offensively, we move the ball, we shoot ourselves in the foot and we have a critical error that puts us in long situations. You can’t win football games if you can’t consistently drive the football. … There was no consistency, whether it was play calling, or it was just execution. We have to do a better job with all that.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno struggled to keep up with Penn offensively as the Quakers lit up the scoreboard on the first play of the game. Quarterback Nick Robinson hit Justin Watson for an 80-yard touchdown reception, stunning the Bears from the start. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown had no response for the 11-second score, punting the ball away on its first possession and fumbling on the second. Penn took advantage of the turnover to take a 14-0 lead midway through the first quarter. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears found some success on the ground later on as running back David Moodie ’19 powered into Penn territory with four consecutive rushes. Quarterback Nicholas Duncan ’19 took over from there, connecting with tight end Anton Casey ’19 on a 33-yard shovel pass and later scrambling five yards into the end zone to cut the Quakers’ lead to seven. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A second-quarter fumble recovery by defensive lineman Michael Hoecht ’20 appeared to swing the momentum in Bruno’s favor, but the offense could not capitalize on the turnover as a field goal attempt sailed wide left. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Quakers found themselves in a similar situation after forcing a Brown fumble on the Bears’ next possession, but Penn managed to increase its lead to 10 with a 51-yard field goal. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The score remained locked at 17-7 for the second half, giving the Quakers the edge and their first Ivy League win of the season as the clock expired.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown has yet to notch a conference victory but is looking for a win against Yale Friday. The Bears will travel to New Haven to battle the top-ranked Bulldogs under the lights of the Yale Bowl. Kickoff is set for 8:00 p.m. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein ’20: Embrace the era of the juiced baseball</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/02/klein-20-embrace-era-juiced-baseball/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This year’s World Series featured baseball at its most exhilarating — full of comebacks, drama, tension and, of course, home runs. In seven games, the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers combined for 25 homers — a World Series record — and set many other records along the way. Game 2 of the series, a 7-6 Astros win, was an offensive explosion with eight home runs in total, which was also a World Series record. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But not everyone is so pleased with the offensive display. Whether or not the baseballs have been altered to enhance offense and home runs was a source of conversation and angst throughout the season. The story only picked up steam in the postseason, with one home run hit after another. The World Series baseballs have come under special fire, as they have felt markedly different according to Houston and Los Angeles’ pitchers. The New York Times published an article Sunday about the new slickness of the balls, which included a quote from Astros starter Justin Verlander, who told reporters “I know (Commissioner Rob Manfred) said the balls haven’t changed, but I think there’s enough evidence out there to say that’s not true.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Several other key figures beyond just Verlander illustrated their concerns. Dodgers pitching coach Rick Honeycutt said “(Yu Darvish) noticed the difference … he had trouble throwing the slider because of how slick they were.” “Obviously, the balls are juiced,” said Dallas Keuchel after his Game 2 start. Lance McCullers Jr. added that “It’s 100 percent real … the balls are different.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some refuted these claims. Dodgers starter Rich Hill said “I think (the balls) have been extremely consistent in the World Series and also in the playoff games as well.” Manfred unsurprisingly defended the baseballs, saying “I’m absolutely confident that the balls we’re using are within our established specifications … making a judgement based on seeing home runs in a single game doesn’t make a lot of sense to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p2">Considering that the complaints are coming from the pitchers themselves, who spend all game with the baseballs in their hands, it certainly seems likely that the balls have been manipulated somehow. But that is not something for the fan to lament about. Juiced balls should be celebrated.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The home run spike first began in the second half of the 2015 season and only picked up in 2016. There were 40.7 at-bats per home run in 2014, compared to 34.9 in 2015, 30.5 in 2016 and 27.7 in 2017. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This season alone has been witness to some of the great campaigns of this generation — Giancarlo Stanton’s 59 home runs and 132 RBI, Aaron Judge’s spectacular breakout performance of 52 home runs and 114 RBI at 25 years of age and Jose Altuve’s tremendous all-around year — a .346 batting average, 24 home runs and 32 stolen bases. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Offense is fun and a whole lot more fun than pitching or defense, as much as baseball purists love to claim otherwise. In the past two years, we have watched some of the greatest games in baseball history, and all were offense-driven battles. Who will forget the Chicago Cubs’ 8-7 triumph over the Cleveland Indians in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series? Or Houston’s 13-12 ten inning heart-pounding victory in Game 5? Or the Astros’ aforementioned extra-inning win in Game 2?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> These games were memorable and generated conversations. Game 1 of the 2017 World Series, on the other hand, passed by without a second thought. The Dodgers won by a score of 3-1 and only nine hits were recorded in total. The game was a snooze and the ratings bore that out. Game 5 beat out Sunday Night Football with 18.9 million viewers. Game 1 was watched by nearly 15 million viewers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To examine World Series ratings more closely, let’s take a look at the numbers from baseball’s previous deadball-esque period. The steroid era, which was similarly characterized by high scores and high viewership, ended roughly in 2005 but was definitively over by 2010. This stretch gave way to a period of low offense and dominant pitching. In 2014, hitters combined to hit 4,186 home runs, the lowest total in since 1993. That year, the World Series was a thrilling matchup between the surprising, contact-hitting Kansas City Royals and the San Francisco Giants, led by the pitching of Madison Bumgarner. The series was an even matchup and should have garnered huge ratings — but average viewership was only 13.9 million, and that includes Game 7’s mark of 23.5 million viewers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The 2013 World Series viewership average was only slightly better at 14.98 million viewers and featured the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals, two of baseball’s most storied franchises. Going back in time, as the offense increases, so similarly do the ratings — 16.5 million in 2011, 19.3 in 2009, 17.2 in 2007, 25.9 in 2004 — the year the Red Sox broke their curse — and a still healthy 20.1 in 2003. The 2010 and 2008 series stand as the lone outliers and both featured matchups which were severely uneven and unappealing to a national audience. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So instead of spending our time complaining about all the home runs, we should just enjoy the ride. Offense has given us a bunch of history-making and drama-filled games. The home run is the most exciting play in the sport, and I would personally rather have more excitement than less excitement. And imagine how fun it would be if, in a couple of seasons, Judge and Stanton battle to overtake Barry Bonds’ single-season home run mark. Baseball would be back in the national news every day and might, at long last, make some actual headway with the younger generations. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">The men’s hockey team opened its season with a home-and-home series against Yale last weekend, besting the Bulldogs 4-1 in New Haven Friday before falling 5-2 at Meehan Auditorium Saturday. Four different Bears scored in Friday’s contest, fueling Bruno to its first victory over the Elis since 2014. In the crease, starting goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 delivered a standout performance, recording a career-high 44 saves.</p>
<p class="p4">Since arriving on campus in 2016, Nieto has made his mark on the Brown hockey program. In his rookie season, he started 27 of Bruno’s 28 games and posted over 30 saves in nine contests. Nieto also notched 42 saves against Quinnipiac University in the first round of the ECAC tournament in March 2017.</p>
<p class="p4">For his outstanding play in the season opener, Nieto has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Herald: You delivered an impressive performance against Yale. What was that game like for you?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Nieto: It was definitely a fun one. It was nice to get the season off on a good foot. We came out really well — we put the pressure on them early, and they were kind of on our heels. They had a lot of shots, but as a team we played really well, especially in our own zone, so it was overall just a great game. It was fun to start the year out with a win.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What were your expectations going into this season?</b></p>
<p class="p4">We have a very good team. Last year obviously didn’t go as we wanted it to, but our freshman class is very strong and guys really put the work in this summer to come back a better team, so we have a lot of confidence in ourselves. We can really come in and have a good year and Friday was a good start, beating a rival in Yale. We got the split on the weekend, but it was a big first step.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>When did you start playing hockey?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I started skating when I was three. My dad fell in love with hockey when Wayne Gretzky came to the Los Angeles<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kings. So when I was born, he threw me into hockey the first opportunity he could. I played my first hockey games around four, so I’ve been playing for a while. I decided to switch over to goalie when I was around 11.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What made you choose to be a goalie?</b></p>
<p class="p4">It’s a really funny story. I was actually a defenseman, and I was always kind of a chubby kid. Our goalie could not make a tournament or got hurt or something, so they needed a goalie and I was the biggest kid on the team, so they threw me in net. (laughs) At the time I was just like “okay,” and I fell in love with it. I loved that you were on the ice the entire game; I loved that the action was always coming towards you.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Do you have a favorite NHL team and a goalie that you like to model your style after?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I am a die-hard Anaheim Ducks fan. My family’s had season tickets since their inaugural season in ’93 so I’ve been going to games — my first game was when I was like two months old. I go to as many games as I can when I’m home. My favorite goalie is Braden Holtby, he’s a great competitor and his mental game is so strong, so I really like watching him. And then along with him, Carey Price is really fun to watch just because he’s so technically sound. He’s by far the best goalie in the league.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Did you play any other sports growing up?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I played baseball until I got to high school, and then once I got to high school I actually played lacrosse until junior year when I moved away to go to prep school for hockey. Growing up, I was always a two or three sport athlete, but hockey was always the sport that really had my heart and was what I would train for in the offseason.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Do you have any pregame routines or things that you do to get in the zone?</b></p>
<p class="p4">After we stretch as a team, I’ll usually go off by myself and either put a hat over my head or find a dark room and just kind of sit there and visualize and kind of picture myself playing well. I’m very big into the whole visualization — whatever you think will happen will happen, I’m very big into that. After we warm up, I usually go and do a lot of mental focusing and visualization, just to kind of get myself ready to go. It really helps me calm down too, because a lot of times I get really amped up and I try to play a really calm game.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Do you like to listen to music when you work out? What do you like to listen to?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I’m big into pregame music. Right now, my pregame mix is kind of all over the place. Probably my go to is the Hailee Steinfeld song with Florida Georgia Line — that one’s on repeat right now.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Has there been a most memorable experience in your Brown career so far?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Friday was pretty memorable. It was really fun to beat Yale on their home ice and do it the way we did it, but the one that sticks out for me is last year, in my freshman year — my first start at Holy Cross, putting a Brown jersey on for the first time and walking out there was pretty special. I get goosebumps thinking about it because it was kind of a lifelong dream finally fulfilled.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>The team has just started its 2017-18 campaign. What are your individual aims for the season?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Individually, I’m trying to really take the next step and be an elite goalie in this league. I want to be above a .900 save percentage and really push to be one of the elite goalies in this league, and really my goal is (for the team) to be above .500 and have a good shot at having home ice advantage in playoffs. If I can do that, we have a good shot at winning a lot of games and having a really good year.</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears continue conference play with visits to Dartmouth and Harvard this weekend before returning home to host Clarkson Nov. 10.</p>

		<title>Red Sox go all in on coaching’s youth movement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">On October 22, the Boston Red Sox announced that it hired 42-year-old Alex Cora to be the team’s next manager for the 2018 Major League Baseball season. Replacing former manager John Farrell, Cora will try to inject some youth and energy to a club that sleepwalked through its elimination in the American League Division Series for the second straight season. I love this addition for the Sox, and the news piqued my curiosity based on a trend I’ve been noticing: Is the average age of managers decreasing, and is that youth translating to success? What I found was surprising and a little head-scratching. But younger managers — I’ll say below 50, but there is no strict age limit — are more beneficial to a team’s short and long-term success.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As mentioned earlier, Cora is 42 years old, which is young for a major league manager but not unheard of. The youngest manager in baseball currently is the Tampa Bay Rays’ Kevin Cash — at 39 years old, he’s still athletic enough to be a player. While hiring younger managers seems to be a trend, research proved otherwise. </span></p>
<p class="p3">In 2017, the average age of MLB managers was 55.2 years old, which is about what I expected. In 2007, however, the average age of managers was 52.8, almost three years younger. And if you go back another ten years, to 1997, the average age is 49.4 years old. MLB managers are actually getting older instead of younger. So why did the Red Sox hire a younger manager?</p>
<p class="p3">The Red Sox’ 2017 season has ultimately been chalked up as a disappointment despite winning the American League East Division back-to-back for the first time in franchise history. Without David “Big Papi” Ortiz, the Sox’ bona fide captain and face of the franchise for years, the team lacked enthusiasm despite a winning record. The other AL division winners were much more successful: ­T­­he Cleveland Indians won an American League-record 22 games in a row, and the Houston Astros bonded together as a team of resiliency for the city in the wake of Hurricane Harvey and went on to win the World Series. The teams had something to play for and had fun doing so, while the Red Sox were resigned in their mediocrity and lack of leadership. Something needed to change and manager John Farrell was let go as the scapegoat.</p>
<p class="p3">Their new manager, Cora, is a former player — he was on the infamous 2004 Red Sox team that broke their 108-year championship drought­ — and the current bench coach for the newly-crowned Astros. Cora has an outstanding reputation working with players — something Farrell lacked — and hopes to guide the Red Sox, with a very strong, young core of players, to a third consecutive AL East crown and past the pesky division series. In hiring a young, relatively inexperienced Cora, the Red Sox are taking a blueprint from the Boston Celtics in a plan that began four years ago.</p>
<p class="p3">In 2013, the Boston Celtics hired Brad Stevens, 37 at the time, away from his head coaching job at Butler University. He was tasked with guiding a young, rebuilding Celtics squad attempting to move on after the “Big 3” era of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen.</p>
<p class="p3">A young, hungry coach was just what the Celtics needed: Someone who wants to win. The Celtics — the players and its front office members — and Stevens grew together, gathering experience and having each other’s backs year after year. Under Stevens, the Celtics have increased their win total every single year, from 25 in 2013 to an Eastern Conference-best 53 wins last year, in which the Celtics lost in the Eastern Conference Championship to the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers. The Celtics were a good four or five years from seriously contending before Stevens, but now the team has advanced the timeline far beyond what management could havehoped for.</p>
<p class="p3">Stevens, at only 41 years old, is already regarded as one of the best coaches in the NBA. The Boston Red Sox are hoping that Cora, who inherits much more talent than Stevens did in 2013, can do the same. But Stevens isn’t the only example of younger coaches having success. The Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers, the two teams in the World Series this year, are managed by A.J. Hinch and Dave Roberts, who are 43 and 45, respectively. Younger managers are finding success and perhaps having a little more fun, as older coaches tend to lack enthusiasm or the spontaneity a team needs.</p>
<p class="p3">Of course, there are exceptions. Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs is 66, and the Indians’ Terry Francona is 58, but both are regarded as a couple of the best coaches in the game. Also, younger coaches don’t always work out. Earl Watson of the Phoenix Suns is only 38 but was let go just three games into the current NBA season.</p>
<p class="p3">Not all coaching decisions pan out, and there will be always be some coaches working for decades based on merit and reputation in which case age is not a factor. But, like the Red Sox and Celtics, we’ll see a trend toward more youthful and energetic coaches as long as they continue to succeed at the highest levels.</p>
<p class="p3">Cora is ready and excited to manage in Boston. In a statement he released shortly after the news broke he said, “Returning to the Red Sox and the city of Boston is a dream come true for me and my family, and I look forward to working towards the ultimate goal of winning another championship for this city and its great fans.”</p>
<p class="p3">I am curious and intrigued on how well Cora will manage in the high-expectation city of Boston. But, if nothing else, I’m already more excited for next season.</p>

		<title>Men&#039;s soccer battle to scoreless draw against Bulldogs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s soccer team entered its final away game of the season in third place, taking on the last-placed Yale Bulldogs Saturday. Neither squad was able to take control of the match, which ended in a 0-0 tie. With the tie and with Dartmouth’s win earlier in the day, Brown was officially eliminated from contention for the Ivy League title. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(Defense) is something we have prided ourselves on the entire season — getting good pressure on the ball, forcing them wide and limiting their chances,” said Louis Zingas ’18. “We created dangerous opportunities to score from turnovers and probably should have scored on a couple of different occasions.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The start of the game was marked by inaccurate passes from both squads and neither team could maintain possession to create a sustained attack. In the 12th minute, a long pass allowed Quinn English ’18 to break through the defense to rocket a shot that landed directly in the chest of Yale goalkeeper Andrew Bortey. Moments later, Josh Totte managed to sneak through the Brown defense to launch a wide open shot, which required a diving save from goalkeeper Joey Cipicchio ’18. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the rest of the half, both offenses relied on controlling 50/50 balls that were not converted into any likely scoring opportunities. At halftime, Yale led Brown 5-2 in shots while the Bears led 3-2 in corner kicks. Both teams had just one shot on goal throughout the first period. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second half began much more aggressively for both sides. In the 51st minute, Bruno was able to work the ball into the 18-yard box but could not convert a shot in the face of Yale’s strong defense. Just a minute later, Jack Hagstrom ’19 managed to head a dangerous ball that was handled by Bortey. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the 59th minute, Miguel Yuste used his speed to open up a lane and shoot from the top of the box. A diving Cipicchio was barely able to handle the low shot and keep the score level. Ten minutes later, Cameron Riach got open on a corner kick and sent a wide-open shot high of the net to squander a Yale opportunity. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the 74th minute, the Bulldogs had another scoring chance when Ryan Matteo delivered a low, sluggish shot just wide of the net. Nico Lozada ’18 almost gave Brown the lead in the 86th minute when he delivered a powerful shot from the top of the box that was saved by a leaping Bortey, who sent the ball high and out of play. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the end of regulation, Yale led 14-13 in shots while the Bears led 10-6 in corner kicks. Each team earned a yellow card for a combined total of 23 fouls. Zingas almost ended the game in the 98th minute with a header, but the ball sailed high of the net, preserving the tie. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yuste responded in the 100th minute with a curling shot, but it was handled by Cipicchio as the end of the first overtime neared. In the second period of extra time, the Bears and Bulldogs showed the fatigue of a 100-minute-game, as the clock ran down, ending the game in a scoreless tie. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Overall, this season hasn’t been exactly as we wanted it,” Zingas said. “But we proved early on that we could play with and beat the best teams in the country. The challenge for the squad next year is just finding the consistency needed to win week in and week out.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will return home to Stevenson-Pincince Field for senior night Saturday to play Dartmouth, this year’s Ivy League champion, in the final game of the season at 5 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trey Dodd ’20 and Nolan Aibel ’20 delivered multiple-point efforts in Friday’s matchup, recording a goal and an assist each. Joe Maguire ’20 also added a pair of helpers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Dartmouth 4, Brown 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite outshooting the Big Green 27-22, the Bears (1-3, 1-3 ECAC) were unable to recover from a trio of early Dartmouth goals Friday night.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We know how we want to play — it’s a matter of how we’re executing and how hard we’re working as a team,” Aibel said. “We weren’t focused off the start and we dug ourselves into a hole, which is never easy to come back from.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Big Green (2-2, 2-1) scored twice in the first six and a half minutes of the contest before widening the lead with a shorthanded goal 22 seconds into the second period.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears responded quickly, when Dodd and Aibel scored within half a minute of one another in the second stanza. Dodd capitalized on a rebound, sending the puck into the right corner of the net at 1:57. Thirty-one seconds later, Aibel collected a feed from Tony Stillwell ’21 and fired a shot from the slot past Big Green goaltender Devin Buffalo to trim the deficit to one.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Conner Wynne ’19 answered a Dartmouth power play goal in the third period, sending the puck over the shoulder of Buffalo with five minutes remaining. But the Big Green closed Bruno out in the final stretch.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the net, rookie goaltender Luke Kania ’21 made his first career appearance with the Bears, stopping 18 shots in the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Harvard 3, Brown 0</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day in Cambridge, Brown fell at the hands of third-ranked Harvard (2-1, 2-1), conceding two power play goals from defenseman Ryan Weiss in the final two frames.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The consistency of Bruno’s penalty kill has been a strength, said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. The Bears entered the weekend at 100 percent on the penalty kill and held the Crimson at 2-for-8 on the power play in Saturday’s loss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Penalty kill has been excellent — the power play for Harvard is one of the best in the country and was last year,” Whittet said. “They have elite personnel that can move pucks, and we have to do a better job of not putting ourselves at that disadvantage, to make sure we are disciplined and don’t get needless penalties.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Zach Giuttari ’20 led the Bears with five shots and Alex Brink ’19 recorded four.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Harvard outshot Bruno 36-26 in the contest. Goalkeeper Gavin Nieto ’20 returned to the crease, posting 33 saves.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking forward, Whittet emphasized the importance of achieving simplicity on the power play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve done a pretty good job on the killing side,” Whittet said. “On the power play we’ve just got to simplify what we’re doing, outwork the opposition and make sure we’re putting pucks in the net and not over-passing.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mentally, the Bears remain poised and focused on the process of improvement as they delve deeper into conference play. With the bulk of its season lying ahead, Bruno seeks to maintain its work ethic in practice and competition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If we’re lazy in practice and we’re not winning battles, that’ll most likely show up in the games,” Aibel said. “It’s a matter of being 100 percent focused, being locked in for a full practice and just constantly competing with each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the team continues to devote attention to its development, the results will take care of themselves, Whittet said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have a team that wants to leave Brown hockey better than when they arrived — there’s a lot of good seniors on our team, and they’ve done things the right way this year,” Whittet said. “I don’t look at where we are four games in in November as where we’re going to be at the end of the season — we’re just going to keep getting better.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears return home to host No. 13 Clarkson and St. Lawrence at Meehan Auditorium Friday and Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Despite the return of veteran quarterback Thomas “TJ” Linta ’18, Brown failed to find an offensive rhythm its 34-7 loss to Ivy League leaders Yale Friday night. A last-minute touchdown reception by Livingstone “LJ” Harriott ’20 prevented the shutout, but the Bears (2-6, 0-5) couldn’t overcome the deficit and suffered their fifth consecutive defeat.</p>
<p class="p4">“We had a good week of practice, and it just didn’t translate well into the game,” Harriott said. “We had a lot of missed assignments. We didn’t execute the way we needed to, and the game went exactly how it should’ve. Yale made plays and we didn’t. It’s just what it came down to.”</p>
<p class="p4">Yale (7-1, 4-1) jumped to an early lead, rushing 68 yards to the endzone on its second play of the game and scoring twice more in the opening quarter. An 83-yard touchdown reception by JP Shohfi gave Yale a comfortable 27-0 lead going into the half and helped the Bulldogs on their way to 563 yards of total offense.</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears made most of their offensive progress through the air after the team’s early deficit as Linta completed 12 passes for 144 yards and a touchdown. David Moodie ’19 led the Bears on the ground, picking up 57 of Brown’s 91 rushing yards.</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno got on the scoreboard late in the fourth quarter after defensive back Terrell Smith ’18 intercepted a Yale pass with 5:25 left in the game. Linta hit Jakob Prall ’20 on a crossing route for 49 yards and a crucial fourth-down conversion before connecting with Jaelon Blandburg ’20 for 19 more. A four-yard grab in the corner of the endzone by Harriott gave Bruno its lone touchdown of the night and settled the final score at 34-7 as Yale took a knee to drain the game clock.</p>
<p class="p4">“Our offense definitely needs to get going,” Harriott said. “We have a lot of playmakers on offense, and we just need to figure out how to find the ball in better situations. Offense is probably the biggest thing we’ve got to focus on. We’ve got to help out our defense, get them off the field and just produce.”</p>
<p class="p4">With only two games remaining, Bruno cannot come away with a winning record but can shake up conference rankings in its game against third-place Dartmouth (6-2, 3-2) at Fenway Park Friday. Sports broadcasting icon Chris Berman ’77 P’08 P’09 will serve as an honorary captain for the Bears as the teams continue their rivalry for the 95th year, and the game will be aired live on NBC Sports Network.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity, especially for our seniors,” Harriott said. “They gave up their last home game to play at Fenway and they’re all-in for it. We’re all pretty excited. It’s another opportunity on national television to show everyone what we got and how good of a team we truly are. Everyone is pretty hyped. We jumped right into preparation really early, so we’ll be ready.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Libero Captain Melissa Cairo ’18 and outside hitters Shirin Tooloee ’18 and Casey Tierney ’18 combined for 10 service aces to power the volleyball team through a comeback win, three sets to two, on Brown’s Senior Day match against Harvard Saturday. Rookie outsider hitter Gabrielle Moriconi ’21 also posted a career-high 18 kills in the victory, which snapped Brown’s five-game losing streak.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After losing in a close 3-1 match against Dartmouth (8-13, 4-8 Ivy) Friday, the Bears (7-16, 2-10) were eager to bounce back. “I was a little hard on them last night,” said Head Coach Diane Short of Friday’s game. “I was very disappointed, and so were they. … I told them, ‘Look, you gotta play for the seniors tomorrow.’ You want to end it on a good note.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> After equalizing two Harvard (12-9, 7-5) match-score leads and narrowly taking the fifth set 15-13, Bruno could not have ended their home-court matches for the season on a more positive note. The fifth set felt “fantastic,” Cairo said. “It was like a movie ending.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears quickly fell behind 5-2 in the first set, and were caught on their heels defensively and lacking in offensive precision. Though Brown utilized increasingly complex attacks as the match progressed, its defense still struggled against Harvard’s surprise tips, and Bruno dropped the first set 18-25.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second set opened with a tone-setting combination block by Moriconi and Courtney Palm ’19. Brown and Harvard went point-for-point until the Bears gained an 11-9 edge and never looked back. Between discovering a weakness in the Crimson’s inability to effectively return short serves and utilizing a full range of deceptive set plays, Bruno scrambled Harvard’s defense and took the set 25-20.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The momentum swung back the Crimson’s way in the third set, as Harvard took advantage of a suddenly sluggish Brown defense. Harvard stepped up its blocking in particular, thwarting Bruno’s cross-court spike attempts and swiftly claiming the set 12-25.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the Crimson’s lead was short-lived, and the Bears exploded into the fourth set with an uncontested six-point streak. A well-called timeout and a few controversial calls in Harvard’s favor put Bruno’s opposition back in the competition, but the Bears stayed calm and composed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Once we started extending the play, we were winning points,” Short said. “Volleyball is about having no fear, because every mistake is a point. You gotta go out and you gotta be aggressive, and you can’t be afraid to do this or do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Fearlessness indeed characterized Bruno’s play, as it found ways to overpower Harvard’s blocking and confuse its defense. Rookie setters Emma Chow ’21 and Bailie Salk ’21 successfully ran multiple set plays, registering a combined 43 assists and three kills in the match. Bruno claimed the set 25-23, taking the Bears to a fifth set for only the second time since conference play began.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The tension was palpable when the Crimson opened the last set with three unanswered points, but Coach Short was not worried. “Even though we were down 0-3, I felt we could win the set and they all felt it too,” she said. Brown rallied to take the lead at 5-4, after which neither team had a lead larger than two points. In the set, Bruno’s three seniors each had a service ace and Moriconi posted four kills, the last of which secured the stanza and the match victory for the Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The seniors … we’ve dedicated our entire lives to the sport,” Cairo said. “The entire team’s parents are here, and just playing for all the people that have supported us for so long — it’s a really fun way to end it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m so proud of the seniors, performing like they did,” Short said. “I’m very fond of them. They’ve just done incredible things, not only being on the volleyball team but with their teammates, and what they’ve done for my family.” Throughout the season, the team has been raising funds and awareness for ALS research, a neurological disease that has affected Short’s immediate family.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> With only two matches left in the season, the nostalgia is creeping in. But the Bears will stay focused as they hit the road next weekend. “They really had the will to win tonight and hopefully this will carry us on to the last weekend,” Short said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown will finish the season by traveling to Columbia Friday and Cornell Saturday. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago this October, the United States Men’s National Soccer Team was eliminated from World Cup contention, missing out on the tournament for the first time since 1986. Even before Trinidad and Tobago sealed their fate, a string of losses and poor play early in the qualification stages raised major doubts for the USMNT. How did the United States get in this mess, and is there a way out?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite having resources and opportunities, the team has been mired in mediocrity, compared to America’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>success in other sports. The United States enjoys perennial success in sports that it invented and has monopolized, like baseball, basketball and football. But the country also wins on the international stage in other sports with a more level playing field. Recent medals in hockey, track and field, swimming and gymnastics show that the United States does not need to invent the sport to succeed in it. So why is soccer different? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The answer is that the bar is simply a lot higher in soccer. In most countries besides the United States, soccer is a way of life. Dribbling, juggling, passing and shooting are second nature, similar to the way throwing a baseball or shooting a basketball is natural for many Americans. As the most popular sport in many countries around the world, soccer attracts the premiere young athletes, whereas many of the best young Americans gravitate toward the four “major” sports that are visible in the media and dole out the biggest paychecks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The United States already starts at a disadvantage to countries that have soccer ingrained as the primary sport in their culture, but it does have the resources for national team development and support that other countries cannot match. As a result, the United States has been able stay relevant in World Cup competitions, sneaking into the top eight in 2010 and tying Portugal to advance to the round of 16 in 2014. This time around, the building came tumbling down in the early stages of World Cup qualification, with back-to-back losses against Costa Rica and Mexico and the ousting of long-time head coach Jurgen Klinsmann.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, in the later stages of qualification, the United States turned things around, revealing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>some bright signs for the future. Bruce Arena replaced Klinsmann as head coach and the team bounced back with a stretch of wins and draws, bringing them closer to qualification. In this period, 19-year-old Christian Pulisic emerged as the team’s undisputed best player. He was involved in 12 of United States’ 17 goals in the last round of qualification. He provides promise at the striker position with the finesse and quickness needed to score on the international stage. Were it not for a last-minute tie against Honduras in the third-to-last match and a loss to Trinidad and Tobago in the final match, the United States would have been able to successfully right the ship and qualify for the World Cup in Russia.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hope for the USMNT resides in youth. Pulisic leads the group as a starter in the latest international matches, but the United States’ investment in its junior teams is paying off. Weston McKennie, Jonathan Gonzalez and Tyler Adams are all teenagers playing professionally ready to answer the bell in the next round of World Cup qualifying in 2019. A stagnant midfield unable to feed the strikers is one of the main issues for the team right now, and Gonzalez and Adams will be able to fill that hole.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On a larger scale, Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber has a plan for the rise of soccer as another one of America’s major professional sports. Between 1999 and now, the MLS has almost doubled in size, from 12 teams to 22, not including two additional clubs slated to spring up in Miami and Los Angeles by 2019. The value of these teams has increased about 80 percent over the last four years, and with more prominent television spots and stadiums, the MLS has grown in visibility. Garber has also implemented programs to incentivize youth participation in soccer. With involvement in football steadily declining due to the dangerous consequences of head injuries and brain trauma, soccer may be well suited to act as a substitute fall sport.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the inexcusable loss to Trinidad and Tobago that excluded the USMNT from World Cup participation, it has a number of bright spots in the young players who will fill in at midfield. The role of the MLS is also increasing in American culture and media and that will do favors for the national team going forward. While the United States missed out on this World Cup this year, they are well-positioned to be a team of the future.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the final home match of her Brown career, volleyball team captain Melissa Cairo ’18 recorded match-highs with 24 digs and four service aces as the Bears defeated Harvard for the first time since 2014. After dropping the opening set 25-18, Bruno answered with a 25-20 victory in the second frame. A 25-12 decision in the third stanza gave Harvard the edge, but the Bears held the Crimson off in a 25-23 fourth-frame win to force a suspenseful fifth set. Following three lead changes and six ties, Bruno claimed four of the match’s final six points to complete the comeback. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The victory over the Crimson could not have come at a better time, as Bruno celebrated Senior Day and snapped a six-match losing streak. The 3-2 triumph also marked the fifth time Cairo has notched 20 or more digs in a match this season, earning her Brown Athletics Student-Athlete of the Week honors. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For her leadership on the court and willingness to dig deep for every point, Cairo has been selected as The Herald’s Athlete of the Week. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: How did you get into volleyball?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cairo: I started playing volleyball when I was eight. My older sister was playing, and they started allowing girls to play around that time. I was really into basketball competitively, and our basketball team also played as a volleyball team, which worked out great. Through there, I started playing club and through my school. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Congratulations on the win over Harvard. How did that feel?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It felt so good! For the seniors to have our last game be a win on our home court was huge. Also, the season hasn’t gone as great as we’d hoped in terms of our record, so it was nice to end with a big win. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What were you thinking going into the fifth set?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I was thinking that I was happy it went to five because it was more opportunity to play on our home court for our last time. We all felt pretty confident because it was just a big win in the fourth, and we kind of came back from a big deficit. We were all in a really good head space. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What did the victory mean to the seniors?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It meant a lot. It was honestly awesome because the three played the whole game together. I think all the seniors did really well. The whole team was just so supportive because for us all to play some people were sitting out, so it was just fantastic for the seniors to succeed in the end. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>As your volleyball career at Brown comes to a close, what has been your most memorable moment?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My most memorable moments come off the court with the team. I love playing volleyball, and it’s been so great. But our team is so close, so it would be the moments off the court. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What will you miss most?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I’ll miss volleyball a lot. It’s been the biggest part of my life for the majority of my life, but I’m going to miss this team so much, especially this year’s team. Our freshman class came in and was such a great group, and we’re all truly so close. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How does this win affect the team’s mentality going into the final two matches of the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It definitely gives us the confidence that we can compete with any team in the league … and (gives) us that extra push to end the season on a high note with some wins. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have any superstitions or pre-game rituals?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a team, something we’ve been doing this season is we wear red ribbons in our hair every game for our coach and her family for ALS awareness. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><i>The Bears will take the court for their final two matches of the season this weekend, facing off against Columbia Friday and Cornell Saturday. </i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><i>— This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Season-best scores on vault and floor and personal-best performances by multiple gymnasts lifted the gymnastics team to new heights as it tallied a 193.325, its highest mark of the season, while on the road at the University of Maryland. The Bears traveled to College Park for a quad meet where they faced tough competition. Bruno finished fourth behind the College of William and Mary, Rutgers University and the hosting Terrapins. But the team came away from the competition feeling accomplished.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This is what we’ve been working for,” said Head Coach Sara Carver-Milne. “Each meet we’ve come so close to this result but had one too many mistakes, so it’s been frustrating. ... Before the competition, even yesterday, all of us at different times of the day were saying that we really feel like this is going to be the meet where we put it all together and realize our potential. So it was really rewarding.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno began the meet on floor exercise and erased memories of last week’s mistakes by posting a 48.050.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(Floor) was a big test for us because ... last week that’s where we made all of our mistakes,” Carver-Milne said. “Coming into this meet in a big arena at the University of Maryland with teams from the Big 10, there was a lot of pressure, but there was a calmness over the team. They were confident.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anne Christman ’20 kicked off Brown’s best performance to date with a season-high 9.625, and Anya Olson ’18 followed with a season-best 9.700. Julia Green ’19 added a 9.575, and Anya Barca-Hall ’18 closed the Bears’ first rotation by earning a career-high 9.700. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The energy was great,” Olson said. “We knew vault scores were hopefully going to be higher than at different meets, so that kept building energy because we were definitely getting scores that we wouldn’t have gotten at other meets.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears carried that positivity to the vault where all six gymnasts raised or matched their season-best scores to notch a 48.100. Christman remained composed in the leadoff position, posting a 9.550. A solid front handspring front pike from Green earned her a 9.675, and Alyssa Gardner ’21 delivered in the anchor position, upping the team score with a 9.750. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riding the momentum of much-improved marks on floor and vault, Bruno took to its strongest event, the uneven bars. Co-captain Claire Ryan ’18 earned a 9.725 for her first routine of the meet while Olson finished her day with a season-high 9.775. Kate Nelson ’21 matched Ryan’s score, and Emma Hansen ’21 tied her personal-best 9.850 to finish third. The Bears came away with a 48.750, repeating the season-high they set on bars at home last Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After three strong rotations, Brown closed out the competition on balance beam where all six gymnasts hit their routines for the second consecutive week. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The last couple of meets, they’ve just really figured things out,” Carver-Milne said. “They’ve gotten way beyond the nerves and really have been able to focus on the details and performing. There absolutely was not one blip today where we felt like we lost confidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rose Domonoske ’21 showed no signs of nerves as she landed her back handspring layout stepout series with ease and posted a career-high 9.750. Hansen followed with a 9.625, and Regan Butchness ’18 added another 9.750 to Bruno’s team total. Green put on the Bears’ final performance of the day, earning a 9.700 to bring up the final 193.325 and put Brown .325 behind third-place William and Mary. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was a great turning point because we could have gone down a bad path of not believing in ourselves,” Olson said. “We kind of went into this meet with a different attitude and a newfound confidence. ... Coming out of it, there’s this new hope that it’s still going to be a great season. We’re right in the running for Ivy (Classics) and ECACs.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears go back on the road next weekend as they fly south for a quad meet at North Carolina State University Saturday. Brown will also compete against the University of Michigan and the University of North Carolina Feb. 17 before chalking up for a meet versus the Tarheels Feb. 19. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Grigo ’18: Give Kershaw the ball in a hypothetical Game 7</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Imagine you’re the manager of a made-up team we’ll call the San Francisco Dodgers, because I’m not very creative. It’s game seven of the World Series, and, for whatever reason, your pitching staff is so loaded that you have both Clayton Kershaw and Madison Bumgarner available to throw on full rest. Who do you start? And yes, it’s against the spirit of the question to say, “It doesn’t matter. I would pitch both for four innings, avoid the third time through the order penalty and hand the ball to my closer in the ninth.’”</p>
<p class="p2">That’s the question that sparked what has become an ongoing debate among my friends and I. It’s a silly argument to have in the sense that it revolves around how to optimize a hypothetical team’s chances of winning a hypothetical game seven of a hypothetical World Series. But it’s not so silly in an important way:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your choice of pitcher reveals how you grapple with small, noisy statistical samples that seem to contradict mountains of other evidence.</p>
<p class="p2">I’m, of course, alluding to the apparent divide between both Kershaw and Bumgarner’s regular season versus postseason stats. The conventional answer to the question of who to start in a game seven is Bumgarner for one simple reason: In the playoffs, Bumgarner’s numbers, measured by traditional statistics, suggest that he has performed substantially better than one would expect given his regular season output, while Kershaw has performed substantially worse. I don’t think anyone would dispute that Kershaw has been the superior regular season pitcher, but Bumgarner’s heroic postseason history seems to weigh heavily in people’s minds.</p>
<p class="p2">But is it the case that Kershaw typically struggles against playoff teams while Bumgarner excels? Aggregating both pitchers’ career regular season numbers against teams that went on to reach the postseason shows that no such differential exists. Excluding their rookie seasons — 2011-2017 for Bumgarner and 2009-2017 for Kershaw — Bumgarner has posted a 2.95 ERA against playoff teams compared to a 3.02 overall ERA, while Kershaw has registered a 2.25 ERA against playoffs teams and an identical 2.25 overall ERA.</p>
<p class="p2">The argument for starting Bumgarner in game seven must then rely on the idea that there’s something different about the postseason that brings out the best in him and the worst in Kershaw. I don’t deny that this might be the case for certain players. But given the sample sizes, how can you possibly know which ace is the better playoff pitcher?</p>
<p class="p2">For some, the answer is easy. “Just look at Bumgarner’s postseason ERA, it’s almost a full run lower than his regular season ERA! Kershaw’s is nearly two runs higher,” they might say.</p>
<p class="p2">The problem with putting so much emphasis on postseason ERA is that you’re relying on a tiny, volatile sample to determine how a pitcher will likely perform in the playoffs going forward. Kershaw has thrown just 122 playoff innings, and Bumgarner only 102 1/3. With so few observations, ERA is relatively meaningless — baseball is notoriously random, and it’s easy for a pitcher’s ERA to get hopelessly skewed over short stretches.</p>
<p class="p2">Consider the graphic attached, which shows the percent change in Kershaw and Bumgarner’s different statistical indicators from the regular season to the postseason.</p>
<p class="p2">Keep in mind while looking at the chart that, except for the strikeout per-nine and left on base percentage columns, positive changes are not good. Take the ERA column, for instance. Kershaw has seen his ERA rise by 84 percent in the playoffs compared to the regular season. That’s very bad.</p>
<p class="p2">Without getting too much into the weeds, the graphic shows that Bumgarner owes his playoff success — and Kershaw his playoff struggles — to factors that sabermetricians have identified as largely out of a pitcher’s control.</p>
<p class="p2">For example, the biggest difference between postseason Kershaw and regular season Kershaw can be seen in the home runs per nine innings column. In the playoffs, Kershaw has given up 122 percent more homers per nine innings than in the regular season, while Bumgarner has surrendered 20 percent fewer long balls. But those figures are driven in large part by each pitcher’s abnormal home run per flyball rates, a statistic far more reflective of random luck than pitcher skill in the short term. Balls lifted in the air against Kershaw in October have turned into home runs 86 percent more often compared to 30 percent less often for Bumgarner.</p>
<p class="p2">Bumgarner has also benefited from an artificially low batting average on balls in play, another statistic prone to wild short run fluctuation. It’s not pictured in the graphic, but batters are hitting just .236 on balls in play against Bumgarner in the playoffs, down from .284 in the regular season.</p>
<p class="p2">To combat that sort of randomness, researchers developed statistics that only include factors pitchers can control — think walk percentage, strikeout percentage and groundball percentage — to estimate a hurler’s ability to prevent runs. Those statistics are represented in the chart as the FIP and xFIP columns, the difference being that FIP penalizes pitchers for every home run allowed, while xFIP estimates the number of homers a pitcher “should have” given up assuming a league average HR/FB rate.</p>
<p class="p2">Sure enough, even though he has declined in the playoffs more than Bumgarner relative to his regular season baseline, Kershaw actually owns the better postseason xFIP, outpacing Bumgarner 3.34 to 3.60.</p>
<p class="p2">After a little more than 100 postseason innings for each ace, we’re left with Bumgarner, who has gotten better results due to what appears to be favorable random variation, and Kershaw, who has been more effective accounting only for the elements of the game in the pitcher’s control.</p>
<p class="p2">So which pitcher has been better in the postseason? I have no idea. As I’ve tried to illustrate, there’s evidence Kershaw has been the superior playoff pitcher, but at only 122 and 102 1/3 innings apiece, the error bars are just too wide.</p>
<p class="p2">But which pitcher am I starting in game seven? Give me Kershaw, the guy who over 1,935 regular season innings owns the lowest era-adjusted ERA of any starting pitcher in history.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following a pair of losses to Dartmouth and No. 3 Harvard last week, the men’s hockey team prevailed over St. Lawrence for the first time since 2014 with a 3-1 victory Saturday. The win highlighted a weekend of opposite decisions as Bruno fell to No. 11 Clarkson 5-3 Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Charlie Corcoran ’18 led the Bears with two goals and a pair of assists over the weekend, and Alec Mehr ’21 and Max Willman ’18 posted a goal and an assist each.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Clarkson 5, Brown 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Friday night, Corcoran, Mehr and Zach Giuttari ’20 scored to bring the Bears (2-4, 2-4 ECAC) within one goal of the Golden Knights (8-3-1, 4-0), but Clarkson closed Bruno out in the final stretch.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A trio of first-period goals — including two on the power play — gave the Golden Knights an early lead. Corcoran put the Bears on the board in the 10th minute, capitalizing on a 6-on-4 advantage after goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 was pulled for an extra skater. Tony Stillwell ’21 delivered a feed to Corcoran, who deflected the puck past Clarkson goaltender Jake Kielly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mehr answered another Clarkson power play goal late in the second stanza, firing a shot top shelf from the circle.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno’s power play struck again when Giuttari trimmed the deficit to one in the final period. At the six minute mark, Giuttari collected a pass from Brent Beaudoin ’20 and launched a shot off the crossbar into the back of the net.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears kept the pressure up, but Josh Dickinson added an empty netter in the final 30 seconds to secure the victory for Clarkson.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno gained offensive momentum later in the contest, outshooting the Golden Knights in the second and third periods for a total shot advantage of 35-28.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We just came out a lot faster in the second and third,” Corcoran said. “To start the game it was pretty tough — we didn’t come out with enough urgency.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In net, Nieto made 23 saves.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 3, St. Lawrence 1</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The following day, Bruno converted twice on the power play to extend an early first-period advantage over the Saints (1-10-1, 0-3-1). A trio of seniors — Willman, Corcoran and Tyler Bird ’18 — recorded goals to clinch the victory for the Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Willman opened scoring in the tenth minute, capitalizing on a 3-on-1 break. Corcoran sent a feed to Willman, who launched a one-timer from the center past Saints goaltender Daniel Mannella.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The start was important — we played with a lot of jump,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “We wanted to make sure we were putting them on their heels, finishing checks and playing in the zone a lot, making them have to chase us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Corcoran took advantage of a St. Lawrence five-minute major penalty in the second stanza by adding a power play goal to widen the lead. Sam Lafferty ’18 and Stillwell each recorded assists.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears’ power play struck again midway through the period when Bird answered a Saints goal, redirecting a pass from Corcoran into the left corner of the net.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We did a pretty good job playing with the lead,” Bird said. “A thing that’s killed us in the past is that we get up a goal or two and then we’ll kind of sit back and stop doing what made us successful. So that was a good thing to just continue to play hard and continue to play with confidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rookie goaltender Luke Kania ’21 stopped 24 shots for his first career win. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears dominated in terms of possession, outshooting the Saints 46-25.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When you have the puck a lot, you’re going to have a lot of offensive opportunities,” Whittet said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno demonstrated command of its special teams play, going 2-for-4 on the power play and 6-for-6 on the penalty kill against the Saints. The power play’s production has increased significantly since the beginning of the season, Whittet said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our power play has been much better — we’re shooting pucks finally instead of trying to pass (around the perimeter),” Whittet said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We focused a lot in practice on just moving pucks quicker, keeping our heads up and shooting more,” Corcoran said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Whittet also saw the team’s play in the defensive zone as a positive.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re able to win some more battles, we’re not giving real easy looks at the net and we’re really defending with five players below the dots,” Whittet said. “We’re not allowing a lot of cycle play or possession play — we’re able to snuff that out.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The victory over St. Lawrence serves as a source of optimism as the Bears delve deeper into their season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was an important game for us,” Whittet said. “We had been playing some pretty good hockey and just hadn’t been rewarded for it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears continue conference play with visits to No. 16 Quinnipiac Friday and Princeton Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m happy with how we shared the ball and we were good going on the offensive glass,” said Head Coach Mike Martin ’04. “We were able to get the ball in the paint and get to the foul line.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears started off aggressively, jumping out to an early eight-point lead behind an opening possession alley-oop dunk from guard Desmond Cambridge ’21 and seven points off the bench from forward Travis Fuller ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We bring athleticism to the team, so coach added a couple of alley-oop plays in there for us,” Cambridge said. “It worked, and it worked nicely.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Wildcats’ hot three-point shooting and untimely turnovers by the Bears gave Johnson and Wales a one-point lead after 11 minutes of play. The Wildcats had an early 56 percent three-point shooting percentage compared to 22 percent by Bruno. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We got good looks in the first half,” Martin said. “They didn’t go down, and we didn’t shoot the ball well.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the half continued, Brown responded to early challenges with precise free throw shooting and clutch three-pointers to go on a 15-0 run and amass a 14-point lead with 5:44 left in the first half. Anderson steadied the Brown offensive attack with physical play, earning important trips to the free-throw line. He took advantage of his opportunities, shooting 11-for-11 from the charity stripe in the first period to build on Brown’s lead. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m just trying to put pressure on the defense and make the defenders commit to me so I can get my teammates open shots,” Anderson said. “We score a lot more when we get the ball to the paint first.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At halftime, Brown led 58-39, shooting 38 percent from the field and an impressive 96 percent from the free-throw line. Fuller led the way with 14 points while Anderson added 13 and two assists. The Bears’ bench showcased the team’s depth, accounting for 23 points in a half that featured Brown’s strong scoring attack. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown’s momentum carried into the second half. Bruno came out of the locker room fast, going on a 12-4 run to stretch their lead to 27 after five minutes of second-half play.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Wildcats recovered from a slow start and managed to trim the lead down to 22 points, but the Bears, boosted by nine second-half points from Cambridge, ultimately proved too much and denied the Wildcats any possible comeback opportunity. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the final buzzer, the scoreboard showed a dominant 28-point victory for the Bears. Anderson finished with a game-high 21 points, while Cambridge, Fuller, Zach Hunsaker ’20 and Joshua Howard ’20 also finished in double-digit scoring. The team shot 41 percent from the field and recorded 13 team assists. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We have a ton to work on,” Martin said. “But we have some talent and have some things to be excited about.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will embark on a three-game road stretch that begins against Quinnipiac University Monday and St. Francis College at Brooklyn Sunday. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The women’s basketball team wasted no time getting off to a winning start to its 2017-18 season with a decisive home victory Sunday over Bryant University. The Bears (1-0, 0-0 Ivy) led the Bulldogs (0-1) by six points at the half, and offensive surges in the fourth quarter saw the lead swell as the game ended 85-62. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The contest was fast-paced, as defensive pressure by the Bears often led to fast breaks that left the Bulldogs scrambling to get back on defense. Twenty-five of Bruno’s points came from converting on these opportunities. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The kids are just responding well to what we’re asking of them,” said Head Coach Sarah Behn of her team’s effective fast break strategy. Behn also praised her coaching staff’s scouting report for preparing the team well to defend the Bulldogs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Free throw shooting significantly impacted Bruno’s playing. Brown was successful at not only attacking the basket and drawing fouls but also making free throws. The Bears were 18 of 22 from the line, while the Bulldogs shot poorly on their free throws, converting on just 8 of 15. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think our free throw percentage this year is going to shoot way up,” said forward Janie White ’18. “Last year we struggled with that a little bit here and there, but we’re getting way more consistent in practice and we’re shooting them way more often. We definitely try to get to the basket a lot especially if our three pointers aren’t falling and our shots weren’t falling as much in the first half today.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Taking a majority of the free throws for the Bears was guard Justine Gaziano ’20. Gaziano was quick off the dribble and cut to the basket productively, often drawing shooting fouls that forced her to the line. Gaziano was an impressive 10 of 11 from the charity stripe, finishing the game with 23 points.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears’ first three-pointer, which fell in the early minutes of the second quarter, came from starting forward Erika Steeves ’19. Though both teams shot poorly early on, the Bears were able to maintain an edge with offensive rebounding. “I’m pleased we did well on the offensive glass, because that covered up some of our poorer shooting earlier in the game,” Behn said. White was the game’s leading rebounder, collecting 11 boards. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team’s early shooting woes were reconciled with an electric fourth quarter, highlighted by guard Shayna Mehta’s ’19 performance from beyond the arc. Mehta was 4 for 8 on three point shooting, hitting three in a row in the fourth quarter. Mehta finished with 16 points and 5 rebounds. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We have several kids that can stroke it, so eventually we started to find our rhythm a little bit more,” Behn said. Guard Taylor Will ’19 also had an impressive stat line, scoring 17 points on an efficient 6 of 9 shooting, including one three-pointer. Will also tacked on a notable 7 rebounds. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moving forward, White hopes the team can improve upon its defense. “We have to talk more and just be more aware in general of the whole floor. That’s something we’ve been working on and emphasizing,” White said. She later added that the team’s offensive threat is stong but hopes that it can round out both ends of the floor with improvements on defense. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Behn<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>also hopes to improve on turnovers. “Their pressure bothered us more than it should have,” Behn said. The team had just 15 turnovers compared to the Bulldogs’ 26, but “it felt like more,” Behn said. “We will work on our composure and our decision making and squeezing the ball and not making careless mistakes.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team will continue with its 2017-18 campaign Nov. 16, facing off against Central Connecticut State.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Men&#039;s cross country best four out of five Ivy League rivals</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The men’s cross country team squared off against a slew of familiar foes Friday at the NCAA Northeast Region Championships, hosted by SUNY at Buffalo. Temperatures hovered in the 20s and the earth was thick with mud, but the Bears nevertheless finished above their forecasted finish. Though ranked only 14th by the USTFCCCA entering the meet, Bruno ultimately claimed seventh place in the team standings with 245 points.</p>
<p class="p2">Led by individual victor Justyn Knight, Syracuse University won the meet with a score of 28, outperforming runner-up Iona College by 20 points.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown’s result represented a marked improvement over its performance at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championship two weeks prior. There, the team had expected to finish in the top half of the Ancient Eight for the first time since 2012, but struggled to a second-to-last place finish — ahead of only Harvard.</p>
<p class="p2">The Northeast Region Championship afforded Bruno a second opportunity to race against Ivy League opponents — besides Penn and Princeton. The Bears made the most of this rematch, finishing hot on the heels of Ivy runner-up Columbia and handily defeating Cornell, Harvard, Dartmouth and Yale. The Lions were fifth with 223 points, but the Big Red, Crimson, Big Green and Bulldogs ranked ninth, 11th, 13th and 17th, respectively.</p>
<p class="p2">“We really wanted to bounce back coming off (the Ivy League Championship),” said captain Martin Martinez ’18. “We weren’t thinking of a specific place at the Regional, but we wanted to beat those Ivy teams and a lot of other teams that just had no business competing with us. We were able to do that, and we almost beat Columbia.”</p>
<p class="p2">At the conference championship, Bruno lacked firepower towards the front of the pack. This was not the case in Buffalo, where two Brown harriers — Gabe Altopp ’20 and Martinez<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— finished in the top 25, earning All-Northeast Region honors for their efforts.</p>
<p class="p2">Altopp blazed a trail for the Bears over the swampy 10-kilometer course. After getting off the line in about 40th place, the sophomore patiently worked his way up through the field. “I would see a guy and make that my goal — to catch up to him,” Altopp said. “I just kept doing that until about 500 (meters) to go. Then it was time for the kick.”</p>
<p class="p2">In the latter stages of the race, Altopp overtook 11 competitors to take 14th place, recording a time of 32 minutes, 17 seconds. Though he only finished 35th at the Ivy League Championship, Altopp was the second Ivy finisher in the Northeast Region, behind Cornell’s Dominic DeLuca.</p>
<p class="p2">“It was awesome to see him have that race,” Martinez said. “We’ve been waiting for him to have a breakout.”</p>
<p class="p2">Martinez himself enjoyed a strong showing in the final cross country competition of his collegiate career. Throughout the race, the captain maintained a consistent position, never falling below 24th place in the individual standings before going on to finish 22nd overall in a time of 32:36. Forty-four seconds after Martinez crossed the line, Brown’s third man, Andrew Foerder ’18, concluded his cross-country career by finishing in 52nd place.</p>
<p class="p2">Foerder thought the race was a fine send-off for the team’s seniors. “This is what you think of when you think of cross country. Muddy and cold and grinding it out with the guys.”</p>
<p class="p2">Cam Daly ’20, who has raced despite illness this season, was fourth across the line for the Bears, nabbing 73rd place in 33:46. Rookie David Scherrer ’21 completed the scoring for Bruno in 84th place, clocking 33:51 for his first-ever 10K race.</p>
<p class="p2">Martinez expects that the team’s current underclassmen will perform well in the future. “We’ve got a lot of good young talent coming back,” he said. “Now we’re looking for those guys … to translate the success they’ve had in cross country to the track.”</p>
<p class="p2">Friday marked the end of the cross country season for Brown, as only the top two teams from the Northeast Region qualified to compete at the NCAA National Championship. Altopp nearly made Nationals as an individual athlete but ultimately missed out on the last qualifying spot by a single second.</p>
<p class="p2">“I can’t be too bummed that I didn’t make it,” Altopp said. “Now I have a goal for next year: to qualify — because it’s apparent that I can make it.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">History appeared to repeat itself as the football team fell to Dartmouth 33-10 under the lights of Fenway Park Friday night. The Big Green (7-2, 4-2 Ivy) had previously faced the Bears twice (2-7, 0-6) in the home of the Boston Red Sox, claiming back-to-back victories over Bruno in Boston 94 years ago. Brown was unable to turn the tides at Fenway, allowing 421 yards, four touchdowns and two field goals in its sixth straight loss this season. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Heading into the game, the Bears were ready to go from the gun.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Going into it, I definitely thought we had a chance to win the game,” said wide receiver Jaelon Blandburg ’20. “We just had to execute our assignments. It was a tough loss, honestly. But I never once thought that we were out of the game. I never once thought my team gave up.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A year ago, Ben Rosenblatt ’18 booted a 52-yard field goal through the uprights late in the first half to give the Bears the edge over the Big Green. But the 27-yard, second-quarter field goal he notched Friday didn’t have the same effect as the Bears failed to find the end zone until the final minutes of the game and after the game was well out of reach. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thomas “TJ” Linta’s ’18 29-yard touchdown pass to Blandburg cut Dartmouth’s lead to 23, but the damage was already done. Big Green quarterback Jack Heneghan racked up 223 of his 263 passing yards in the first half, and the Bears were outgained 141 to 28 on the ground for the game. Blandburg led the team in rushing with one 14-yard carry while starting running back Darius Daies ’21 only managed nine yards on nine rushes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(Dartmouth) gave us everything we expected,” Blandburg said. “They didn’t do anything different from what they showed on film. We went into it knowing they were going to run the zone, and they stayed to that the whole game.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Linta’s 44 passing attempts were his second-highest of the year, and it was only the third time he eclipsed 200 yards in a game. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dartmouth took control early, scoring once in the opening quarter and adding 17 more points before halftime. A second-quarter interception by cornerback Jorquel Condomina ’19 looked to give Brown a chance at a comeback right after it got on the board. But the Bears failed to take advantage of the turnover after being stopped short on an attempted fourth-down conversion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The momentum stayed with the Big Green for the remainder of the game as Dartmouth returned an interception for another touchdown on Bruno’s opening drive of the second half and added a fourth-quarter field goal, bringing the final score to 33-10.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s all about us going 11 for 11. All 11 people doing their job all in the same play,” Blandburg said. “I think that’s what we struggle with the most — everybody executing on the same play. I feel like we’re definitely good enough to be winning the game, but it’s small mistakes here and there that cost us.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prior to kickoff, Brown honored its 25 seniors for their commitment and contributions to the program. The veterans gave up their final game in Brown Stadium to play as the home team at the historic ballpark, marking the first season since 1925 that Bruno did not host a game in November. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Award-winning sports journalist Chris Berman ’77 served as an honorary captain for the Bears, joining team co-captains Isaiah Thompkins ’19 and Richard “Dewey” Jarvis ’17.5 during the coin toss. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was awesome,” Blandburg said. “I don’t even know how to explain it. It was just crazy. Being in a stadium that has so much history…it wasn’t like a normal football game. It was a crazy experience.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will cap off their season against Columbia at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium Saturday. With a win, Bruno can knock the Lions out of second place and claim its first conference victory of the season. The last team to go winless in Ivy League play was the 2014 Lions and Bruno will be trying to avoid a similar fate next week. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The main focus for the Columbia game is just to win and come out on top,” Blandburg said. “This is our Ivy League championship. Every game is like an Ivy League championship. We’re just trying to win.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">The volleyball team overcame a two-set deficit to force a tiebreak fifth set Saturday against Cornell but fell short of a comeback. Outside hitter Sabrina Stillwell ’19 tallied 13 kills and libero captain Melissa Cairo ’18 registered 28 digs in the season-concluding match.</p>
<p class="p4">Though a defeat, the result left the team in high spirits. “I was happy with the way they performed today,” said Head Coach Diane Short. “(It) was good to see them improve week to week. … Next year, we’ve got a good core returning, … and I feel very optimistic that we’ll do much better next year.”</p>
<p class="p4">Both teams had a slow start in the first set, but Cornell (12-11, 8-6 Ivy) gradually built up a lead that put the team past the 20-point plateau at 20-15. Yet the Bears (7-18, 2-12) did not let the Big Red relax, and responded with a six-point streak powered by serves from outside hitter Casey Tierney ’18. The ensuing point-for-point battle turned into a win-by-two situation when a kill from outside hitter Stillwell tied the set at 24 apiece. But a Bruno service error and a sharp kill by Cornell gave the first set to the Big Red, 26-24.</p>
<p class="p4">The second set was less evenly matched, with Cornell taking the lead at 2-1 and never looking back. The Bears stayed on the heels of the Big Red, but, with lackluster defense and mistake-prone offense, Brown could not overcome Cornell’s hard-swinging outside hitters and highly reactive defense. The Bears dropped the set 25-22.</p>
<p class="p4">The third frame started on a more optimistic note. Brown gained its first lead at 6-5 after two instrumental block assists by Jacqueline Jacobs ’20 and Gabrielle Moriconi ’21 and two Cornell attack errors forced by Elisa Merten ’19. The Big Red did not back down, and the lead changed four more times in the set, but two back-to-back attacks by outside hitter Shirin Tooloee ’18 clinched the set for the Bears, 25-23.</p>
<p class="p4">“We started playing a little more free,” Tooloee said of the change in momentum. “We started swinging and taking big hits at the net. … Cornell is really good at digging a lot of balls, and so just not getting frustrated when they got balls up and really just going after it was what changed the momentum at the end of the second set.”</p>
<p class="p4">This momentum carried into the fourth set, with Bruno opening on a 5-1 run against a caught off-guard Cornell. The Big Red fought back to tie the set at seven-all, but the Bears maintained their lead by capitalizing on Cornell’s mistakes to go on several point-streaks. It wasn’t until the Big Red hit the 20-point plateau that Bruno got into trouble, with Cornell surging ahead for the set point at 24-22. But with poise and grace, Emma Chow ’21 set up Stillwell for two consecutive kills that tied the set 24-24 and once again brought the stanza to a win-by-two situation. A kill from Tooloee and two Cornell errors gave the set to the Bears, 27-25 and tied the match score at two-all.</p>
<p class="p4">“The fourth set was awesome, especially the last few points,” Tooloee said. “Those were the best points we played all season … it just really showed that this team is so close, and we all wanted to play for each other, and we all wanted to lay it all on the court and leave nothing behind.”</p>
<p class="p4">But the elation was short-lived. After tying at one-all in the fifth set, the Bears quickly fell behind as they experienced difficulty coordinating attacks and breaking through Cornell’s tight defense. “We just got stuck in a rotation we couldn’t get out of,” Short said. “But we fought hard.”</p>
<p class="p4">At a 14-2 set point, Bruno squeezed three more out of the Big Red before Cornell took the set 15-5 and the match 3-2.</p>
<p class="p4">Despite its losing record, the team has found this season rewarding in other ways. “This is such a very close team,” Coach Short said. “They come in working hard every day, one of the closest teams I’ve ever coached.”</p>
<p class="p4">Tooloee reflected on the close of her senior season. “It’s a little surreal right now. It definitely hit me … at the end of the match,” she said. “I got a little emotional just because the team is so close. … It was sad realizing it was my last game I was going to be with them, but it was satisfying to go to five (sets).”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Diane Short steps down after 25 seasons</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/16/diane-short-steps-25-seasons/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">When Diane Short took over the volleyball team in 1993, only three student-athletes showed up to join the team. The program had just regained varsity status after being demoted in 1991, and Short had to employ some creative tactics to field her inaugural squad.</p>
<p class="p4">“I showed up at freshman orientation and recruited a team,” Short said. “If they went for the ball, I’d take them. … That was a fun team because they worked so hard, but we weren’t great. The following year, we recruited eight freshmen and started building the program.”</p>
<p class="p4">Twenty-five seasons later, Short is stepping down from her role as head coach, but her impact on the program will outlast her retirement.</p>
<p class="p4">“I had not really premeditated this,” Short said. “It was presented to me, and I accepted it. Brown has been really good to me, and, even after I’m gone, Brown will still be helping me,” with potential employment opportunities in the future.</p>
<p class="p4">“It was kind of a spur of the moment decision,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“Brown volleyball is pretty synonymous with her because she’s been here for the last 25 years,” said team co-captain Melissa Cairo ’18. “All of us owe our careers at Brown to her. She has definitely established the program.”</p>
<p class="p4">After winning a state championship while coaching at her former high school and serving three seasons as the assistant coach at Providence College, Short was given the responsibility of reviving Brown volleyball. In 1994, she stated that she would win an conference title in three years and delivered on that promise, claiming the crown two seasons later along with a trip to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament.</p>
<p class="p4">Short took the Bears back to the NCAAs with a second Ivy championship win in 1998 and notched her third conference title in 2001. She produced three Ivy Players of the Year, two Ivy Rookies of the Year and 27 All-Ivy League players. But her influence on the teams she coached went beyond the accolades.</p>
<p class="p4">“Coach Short has the most amazing outlook on life,” wrote Shirin Tooloee ’18 in an email to The Herald. “She’s fearless and lives every day to the fullest. Even when faced with adversity, she handles herself so well, and she’s been such an inspiration to us.”</p>
<p class="p4">Though she primarily offered guidance on the court, Short understood her athletes were also students and encouraged them to pursue whatever academic path they chose.</p>
<p class="p4">“She allowed each of us to not only be the kind of athletes we wanted to be but the students we wanted to be (as well),” Cairo said. “She really allowed us to try to reach our full potential as an athlete and a student, and I will be forever grateful for that.”</p>
<p class="p4">While she won’t necessarily miss the five-hour bus rides to Cornell or the 7 a.m. workouts, Short will miss the she time spent with her assistant coaches and players. But her time off the court may be brief, as she isn’t “burnt out” on coaching at all.</p>
<p class="p4">“I thoroughly love coaching, and I’m going to coach again,” she said. “I love the sport so much that it doesn’t matter what level I coach. I still enjoy just being in the gym. In a way, I feel like Superwoman in the gym.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">The men’s cross country team closed out its season in New York last Friday, finishing seventh out of the 37 squads that competed at the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships. The Bears recorded 245 points and finished second among Ivy League competitors, trailing only Columbia. Gabe Altopp ’20 delivered a standout performance, completing the 10-kilometer course with a time of 32:17.7 to finish 14th out of 254 runners.</p>
<p class="p4">Since arriving at Brown in 2016, Altopp has been a significant presence on the team. Altopp set a personal best of 25:01.3 in the 8K at the NEICAA Championships in his rookie season, recording a ninth place individual finish. He also registered a 28th-place finish at the Coast-to-Coast Battle in Beantown and was 52nd in the 2016 Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. In the 2016-17 indoor season, he came in fourth in the mile at the John Donahue Games with a time of 4:13.97.</p>
<p class="p4">For his outstanding run last week, Altopp has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Herald: You placed highly this weekend in the 10K. What was that race like for you?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Altopp: It was muddy to begin with, and it was 25 degrees, so it took a lot of focus to not let those factors distract me from the goal, which was to place as high as possible. Over 10 kilometers, it’s 30 minutes of sharp focus that you need to maintain. For me, that was hard at times, especially when it started to hurt later on in the race, but I felt good the whole way through. I just focused on not letting the weather affect me and that ended up working in my favor.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Friday’s meet closed out the team’s 2017 campaign. Can you reflect on the season a little?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">For much of the season, I hadn’t been feeling that great. It seemed like there was a net upward trajectory throughout the season. I started off pretty poorly — I wasn’t racing very well, but then, as the season progressed, I began to perform better. I was not expecting to place as highly as I did, so to finish 14th was definitely a nice surprise, and it was definitely a high point of my season. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>When did you get into running?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The first year I ended up running was in the spring of seventh grade. Seventh grade was the first year that we were able to start playing sports at my middle school, and we only had an outdoor track. Before high school, I moved to Connecticut, and that’s when I became more serious and started running all three seasons.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Did you play any other sports growing up?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yeah, baseball was kind of my sport before running — I only joined the track team in middle school because I got cut from the baseball team.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>You have competed in different distance events on the track. Do you have a favorite?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yeah, I’d say the 3K, that’s probably my favorite. It’s a nice mix — it’s an endurance event, but it’s not like the 10K. Last Friday was a 10K, and that’s a very grueling race because you’re running for over 30 minutes usually. The 3K is over in eight and a half minutes. I also just enjoy running on the track. Fifteen laps on the indoor track is the perfect length I think.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have a favorite meet day breakfast or meal?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I usually just go with cereal, but on race day last Friday we were at a hotel, so there were more options. I think I had a bagel and eggs, and two cups of coffee; coffee’s a must have — and orange juice. Pretty standard stuff, nothing special.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have any pre-race rituals or routines that you do to get in the zone?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">No, I try to stay relaxed. I try to visualize the race before I get in the line, but that’s not much of a ritual. I guess the biggest thing is just staying relaxed and not letting the nerves get to me, which is pretty easy to do on a stage as big as Regionals or Heps. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How did you choose Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I was looking at other schools, mostly in the Ivy League. I came to Brown because of the team here. When I visited in the fall of my senior year, this team stood out to me — it was definitely the most cohesive, and I liked a lot of the guys. I had a great host too — shoutout to Andrew Foerder ’18. I was intrigued by the open curriculum — that seemed appealing to me, but it was definitely the team that stood out to me above everything else.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>It won’t be long until the team starts competing indoors on the track. How are you preparing for that? What are your plans for the off-season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We’re already gearing up for indoor. Right now we’re just doing base mileage — we’re not working out or anything. In the off-season, I’ll still be running. We have winter break, so I plan on enjoying that. I’ll still be running out in the snow, but won’t have classes to worry about or anything. I’m not doing much in the off-season, just getting excited to race in indoors.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Major League Baseball offseason has arrived, and that means another crop of free agents hitting the open market. While next year’s free agents, a group that includes Bryce Harper and Manny Machado, have garnered more attention, there is still quite a lot of talent available over the next few months for teams in title contention. The following are the top three free agents and predictions of their respective destinations.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Yu Darvish</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The right-hander last left Los Angeles Dodgers fans disappointed after a short start in game seven of the World Series, as he was thoroughly eviscerated by the Houston Astros offense. In two series starts, he surrendered eight earned runs on nine hits in only 3.1 innings pitched, for a 21.60 ERA and 3.30 WHIP. While Darvish was apparently tipping his pitches, his final appearances were simply not the best way to kick off free agency. Darvish’s stamina has been a concern for some time, and his postseason track record — he owns a career 5.81 playoff ERA — has done nothing to alleviate these worries.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Even if Darvish pitched terribly in the playoffs, at least he was not injured. The pitcher missed the end of 2014 with an elbow injury, spent the entire 2015 season receiving and recovering from Tommy John surgery, suffered a shoulder strain in 2016 and dealt with a period of back tightness in August 2017. Darvish is already 31 years old; it remains to be seen how many teams will offer him the contract he desires with so vast an injury history. Signing aging players has been a formula for disaster in recent years — one has only to witness Albert Pujols limp around for the Los Angeles Angels to understand the risk involved. Any team that signs Darvish will be taking a massive leap of faith.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, even with all the potential negatives, Darvish is still one of the most talented pitchers in the game. His 2013 season, in which he recorded 277 strikeouts and a 2.83 ERA, speaks for itself. Darvish boasts a sharp slider that is often unhittable and an array of other impressive secondary pitches, which he can mix in at any time. His 2017 season, aside from the back issue and postseason, was nothing short of a success. Darvish pitched 186 and two-thirds regular season innings, striking out 209 batters and accumulating a 3.86 ERA and 1.16 WHIP.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Darvish has a number of interested teams and will be free to pick a contender to try his luck with and reverse the current postseason narrative of his career. Darvish’s two former teams — the Dodgers and Texas Rangers — reportedly want the righty back, but the New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, St. Louis Cardinals and Minnesota Twins will all make convincing cases for Darvish to jump ship.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">But I think he’ll stay with the Dodgers. Darvish will want another chance at World Series glory and playing with the Dodgers presents his best chance to do so. A World Series win back in Los Angeles would be all the sweeter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>J. D. Martinez</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The outfielder has turned into one of the game’s most feared sluggers after a 2014 swing adjustment that kept his bat in the strike zone for a longer period of time. Martinez hit 23 home runs in 2014, 38 in 2015, 22 in an injury-shortened 2016 season and a career-high 45 in 2017. His remarkable .690 slugging percentage led the majors last year. Acquired mid-season by the Arizona Diamondbacks from the Detroit Tigers, Martinez helped to anchor Arizona’s lineup around Paul Goldschmidt on the way to a playoff appearance.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Martinez, represented by the famous agent Scott Boras, is seeking a massive $200-plus million contract. In this golden age of home runs, teams may not be willing to give up that much to sign Martinez. Over the past couple of offseasons, sluggers like Mark Trumbo and Nelson Cruz have been forced to sign for less than expected. Power is a surplus in baseball at the moment, so the market for home run hitters has been depressed. Still, Martinez stands out among the rest of baseball’s sluggers and can play the field adequately, unlike Trumbo or Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The St. Louis Cardinals, Arizona Diamondbacks, San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox are the teams currently in the mix for Martinez’s services. Others may follow, but those four teams already represent a breadth of opportunities for Martinez. He could return to a situation in Arizona that has already worked — though the Diamondbacks are unlikely to give him $200 million. On the other hand, hitting at Fenway Park provides Martinez yet another power boost — the right-handed hitting Martinez could hit more than 50 homers over the Green Monster. The Cardinals and Giants, meanwhile, are traditional National League contenders. San Francisco has shown an enthusiasm for big moves this offseason after a rough 2017, attempting to trade for Giancarlo Stanton.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">I predict Martinez will end up with the Boston Red Sox. The chance to hit a plethora of home runs and contend for a championship is too good to pass up.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Eric Hosmer</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The first baseman was the leader on the 2015 World Series champion Kansas City Royals and has been a dependable part of their lineup for years. Hosmer totaled 25 HR and 94 RBI with a .318 BA<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and .883 OPS last year, in his finest big league season yet. At only 28 years of age, Hosmer has several prime seasons ahead of him and will see a lot of generous offers.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">While 2017 saw a star-quality season from Hosmer, his overall body of work is less encouraging. He hit only .266 with a .761 OPS in 2016, and though his 2013 and 2015 campaigns were better, his OPS figures of .801 and .822 still fall well short of this year’s mark. Hosmer’s 2012 and 2014 seasons were even worse — .663 and .716 OPS numbers respectively — which put the first baseman at the level of a replacement-level player.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Hosmer cited a hitting adjustment, learning to lay off inside fastballs, as the reason for his improvement. If that change holds, Hosmer can play at an All-Star level for years to come and move past the sometimes-shaky beginning of his career.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Teams interested in Hosmer include the Red Sox, Royals, Mariners and New York Mets. The Royals are the sentimental choice, but will not be able to offer Hosmer the contract he wants. The New York Mets may not have enough talent healthy on the field to entice the first baseman. It may come down to the Red Sox and Mariners. While Seattle may seem like a dark horse candidate, the team has been willing to spend big in the past and could form a dominant infield with Hosmer, Cano, Jean Segura and Kyle Seager.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Hosmer will travel west to play for the Mariners. With the addition of Hosmer, the Mariners can set themselves up for a playoff run in 2018.</span></p>

		<title>Blasberg &#039;18: Celtics keep winning with depth</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One thing that has characterized the New England Patriots’ 16-year reign of terror on the NFL has been the team’s ability to win, even when key players are injured or get traded away. Staying the course even when chunks of the team are missing has been dubbed the “next man up” mentality, and it speaks to a team’s depth as well as its overall culture. For example, while the Patriots are famous for delivering wins by optimizing their depth, the Boston Celtics have adopted it this season. And they have been winning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Celtics’ season was off to a tumultuous start when they lost their blockbuster offseason signing Gordon Hayward to a season-ending ankle injury in the opening minutes of their first game. They went on to lose to the Cavaliers in game one and were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in the following game, leaving fans wondering what kind of grit this team had. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fans were right to wonder about this group. After all, it has only four returning players from the previous season, and its longest tenured player, Marcus Smart, is just in his fourth year with the team. Furthermore, the Celtics were built with Gordon Hayward as a centerpiece. Losing him forced 19-year-old rookie Jayson Tatum to assume a larger scoring burden.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Despite their early-season woes, the Celtics responded by rattling off 14 consecutive wins en route to the best record in the NBA. These wins have not come easy as the undisputed leader of the team, Al Horford missed two games while going through the NBA concussion protocol. Kyrie Irving, the most prolific scorer on the team­ — and maybe in the entire league so far this season — missed almost two games with a facial fracture. Backup center Marcus Mo</span><span class="s2">rris missed the season’s first nine games with knee soreness, and Jayson Tatum had to miss time due to ankle soreness. Still, since Oct. 18, the Celtics are undefeated.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Barring an unpredictable injury to Gordon Hayward, Danny Ainge’s high-profile transactions over the past two years have paid off with terrific on-court production and leadership from Al Horford and Kyrie Irving. Less visibly, though, his moves this offseason replacing last season’s bench have been just as impressive and impactful.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Ainge signed point guard Shane Larkin who, after being dismissed by the Brooklyn Nets, ended up in Barcelona last summer. He has been a solid scoring guard off the bench, and his 16 points against the Charlotte Hornets and lock down defense against the Nets were instrumental in securing wins against both teams. The backup big men have been just as critical. Like Larkin, Daniel Theis came to the Celtics via Europe, and Theis has been a remarkable defender and rebounder so far. Aron Baynes is also a key piece to the rotation, splitting time with Theis as a replacement for Al Horford. Defense in the paint and rebounding were glaring weaknesses for the Celtics last season. Theis and Baynes, along with Horford, have changed that so far. The Celtics have a league-best 95.8 defensive rating and are third in the NBA with 56.5 rebounds per game.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Danny Ainge has shown flashes of Bill Belichick recently by signing other teams’ misfits and castaways and putting them in a position to make an impact. The bench has been crucial to the Celtics’ 13-game win streak, as Hayward is out for the season and Horford, Kyrie Irving and Jayson Tatum have all missed significant time due to injuries. Against strong opponents like the Bucks, San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder, the bench has stepped up to push the Celtics to victory. Astute offseason transactions by Danny Ainge have enabled these Celtics to be championship contenders even without the superstar Hayward.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following a victory over St. Lawrence last week, the men’s hockey team earned its first shutout of the season with a 3-0 win against Ivy rival Princeton Saturday. The victory highlighted mixed results over the weekend, as Bruno fell to Quinnipiac 5-0 Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 delivered a career-high 47 saves against the Tigers for his first career shutout and Tommy Marchin ’19 recorded a pair of goals in Saturday’s win.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 0, Quinnipiac 5</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday night, the Bears (3-5, 3-5 ECAC) were closed out by a solid Quinnipiac defense. Landon Smith earned a natural hat trick for the Bobcats (5-5-1, 2-4), scoring three consecutive goals in the first two periods.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chase Priskie and Tanner MacMaster added goals for Quinnipiac later in the second stanza to widen the advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Max Willman ’18 led Bruno with four shots, but the Bears were unable to capitalize on their offensive opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(When forechecking), we were kind of expecting favorable outcomes for us, hoping that we’d get the puck rather than sticking to our system and knowing where each guy is going to be,” Marchin said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno went 2-for-4 on the penalty kill in the loss, conceding a pair of goals to the Bobcats’ power play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In net, goaltender Luke Kania ’21 made a career-high 31 saves. Quinnipiac outshot Brown 36-22.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 3, Princeton 0</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, strong goaltending from Nieto and a forceful offensive presence powered Bruno over the Tigers (3-3-1, 2-3-1). Despite being outshot 47-34, the Bears were able to take advantage of scoring opportunities in the offensive zone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were playing sound systems on our forecheck and letting them make mistakes rather than force anything,” Marchin said. “We were kind of waiting for opportunities for them to break down, and then we capitalized pretty well on those.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Marchin opened scoring two minutes into the second period, collecting a pass from Chris Berger ’21 and launching a shot from the circle past Tigers goaltender Ryan Ferland.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brent Beaudoin ’20 added a goal midway through the third stanza. After Sam Lafferty ’18 won a faceoff in the zone, Beaudoin fired the puck through Ferland’s five-hole to widen the lead.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Three minutes later, Marchin scored his second of the evening after collecting a feed from Nolan Aibel ’20 from the blue line. Marchin<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>fended off a pair of Princeton defensemen and handled the puck around Ferland glove side.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno demonstrated strong command of its penalty kill, going 7-for-7 against the Tigers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Princeton had a really good power play, so it was a really good test for us to figure out where we needed to be,” Marchin said. “A lot of guys stepped up yesterday and it was very beneficial to all of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking forward, the Bears seek to continue the development of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the penalty kill and improve on their current 83 percent success rate. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our penalty kill is something we can build on,” Marchin said. “When we kill a good penalty — or seven in a row like we did against Princeton — it really gives the guys energy on the bench to play hard.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With its first non-conference duel coming up this week against Holy Cross, Bruno remains focused on internal improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve been focusing more on our game rather than who we’re playing,” Marchin said. “What we’re thinking about now is how we’re getting better and how we need to stick to what makes us good and worry about ourselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears host Holy Cross at Meehan Auditorium Tuesday, before resuming ECAC play at Union Dec. 1.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The men’s basketball team looked to continue its early season success in a road match-up against St. Francis Brooklyn Sunday, but was unable to wipe away a large first-half deficit, falling 77-74 in a nail-biter. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s early in the season, so we definitely have a lot of room to grow and improve,” said Travis Fuller ’19. “We played hard. We just need to execute better both offensively and defensively.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the first half, the Terriers (1-2) were led by Jalen Jordan, who contributed 16 points in the first 20 minutes to put Bruno in an eight-point halftime hole. While the Bears shot 55 percent from the field in the first half, their 38 percent mark from three-point range<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and 78 percent shooting on free throws were not enough to match St. Francis. Bruno (2-1) also lost 10 turnovers in the half, which was double that of the Terriers and helped give St. Francis its early lead. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandon Anderson ’20 led the way in scoring early for the Bears with seven first half points. Anderson and Zach Hunsaker ’20 caught fire, with Anderson scoring 14 points in the second half along with Hunsaker’s 10. The Bears’ crisp free throw shooting helped the comeback, as Brown only missed one from the charity stripe in the second half. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With just 3:13 left in the game, Brown managed to take a one-point lead. But with barely more than a minute remaining in the contest<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a clutch three pointer from Jordan gave the Terriers a four point lead. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anderson was able to trim the lead to one with 33.5 seconds remaining and the Bears forced a turnover to regain possession. Anderson and Desmond Cambridge ’21 both missed potential game-winning jump shots. St. Francis was able to make timely free throws to take a three point lead with only five seconds remaining. Anderson had another chance to tie the game at the buzzer, but he could not connect on the deep three-pointer. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">St. Francis was able to close out the Bears<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in part due to Rasheem Dunn’s 16 second half points along with nine points from Darelle Porter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anderson finished with a team-high 21 points, and was helped by 15 points and seven assists off the bench from Hunsaker, 10 points from Cambridge and eight points and two steals from Joshua Howard ’20. The Bears shot 46 percent from the field,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>33 percent from beyond the arc and made 86 percent of their free throws. The team also accounted for 13 assists and five steals. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I have full confidence in this team, and I’m excited to get back at it,” Fuller said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Our goal is always to win the Ivy League championship.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno will return to the court Wednesday against Stony Brook University before travelling to Bryant University Sunday. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Football finishes season with 24-6 loss at Columbia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Seven weeks after recording what would be its last win, the football team closed out its 2017 season with a 24-6 loss to Columbia on the road Saturday. The Bears’ (2-8, 0-7 Ivy) defense put up a strong performance to keep Columbia within striking distance for three quarters, but the Lions’ (8-2, 5-2) special teams pounced on Bruno’s kicking game to seal victory and a second-place finish in the Ivy League.</p>
<p class="p2">Michael Hoecht ’20, Grant Varner ’19 and co-captain Richard “Dewey” Jarvis ’17.5 all found their way past Columbia’s offensive front into the backfield for a combined six sacks. Bruno racked up ten tackles for loss and forced a fumble, holding Columbia to only 275 yards of total offense.</p>
<p class="p2">“The defense played amazing,” Jarvis said. “They did a great job …There was a lot of emotion because it was the last game for a lot of people. We’ve been installing new packages and new plays all week, so we were able to show up and run some of those new packages. Mainly, it was a lot of emotion coming from the older guys who wanted to fight for their final game.”</p>
<p class="p2">Jarvis closed out his career with 16.5 sacks, finishing second all-time at the University.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite outgaining the Lions in total yards and dominating on the defensive side of the ball, the Bears were unable to find a spark on offense, notching only five trips inside Columbia territory and two red zone appearances.</p>
<p class="p2">After failing to complete a single pass in the first quarter, Thomas “TJ” Linta ’18 connected on 30 of 60 attempts for a season-high 263 passing yards. The veteran quarterback also led the team on the ground with 26 rushing yards as the Columbia defense bottled up the Bears.</p>
<p class="p2">By the time Linta completed a three-yard shovel pass to Livingstone “LJ” Harriott ’20 late in the third quarter for Bruno’s sole touchdown, the Lions had already deflected a 47-yard field goal attempt and returned a blocked punt for a touchdown. But Columbia’s special teams weren’t finished, as they broke up the Bears’ point after kick to hold them to six. The Lions rode that momentum into the end zone on their opening drive of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="p2">With four minutes left on the game clock, Brown pieced together an 86-yard drive that stalled at the Columbia six and fizzled out after the Bears failed to convert on fourth and one, bringing the final score to 24-6 after the Lions took a knee to bleed the clock.</p>
<p class="p2">Prior to the season-ending loss, the football team had not finished with a 2-8 record since 2002. The Bears notched at least one conference win in all of Head Coach Phil Estes’ P ’19 previous 19 seasons and never finished lower than sixth in league standings. But this year, Bruno failed to defeat any Ivy League opponents and couldn’t claw its way back from the bottom of the standings after settling there early on.</p>
<p class="p2">Among other statistics, the Bears also finished dead last in the Ivy League in total offense, total defense, scoring offense, scoring defense and third down conversion percentage.</p>
<p class="p2">“We just didn’t make plays as a team when we needed to,” Harriott said. “We let a lot of opportunities go, and we just weren’t all going 11 for 11 and firing on all cylinders when we needed to. We had a lot of opportunities to take advantage of, and we didn’t. That’s why our season ended the way it did.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears will have a chance to start fresh in their season opener against California Polytechnic State University next September with a new class of seniors to lead the team forward.</p>
<p class="p2">“It was amazing,” Jarvis said. “You sacrifice every single day just to wear that Brown jersey and that last time putting it on meant a lot to people. I know a lot of guys were giving each other hugs at the end of the game. There were tears because we know that that’s the end of our football careers, and now we have to make our lives about something else. Most of the seniors believe it’s been an amazing ride and we would definitely go back and do it all again.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The women’s basketball team was back in action this week, starting off with a commanding 78-55 victory at Central Connecticut State University Thursday but following with a 89-79 loss to No. 20 University of California at Berkeley Sunday. Playing against the Blue Devils (0-3), the Bears (2-1) controlled the flow of the game from the start, limiting CCSU to just seven points scored in the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Guard Justine Gaziano ’20 led her team with 22 points, five rebounds and two assists. Bruno struggled from three-point range, scoring on just five of 24 attempts, but was still more successful than the Blue Devils, who converted on four of 25 from three. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We did well in transition. We had a really good first quarter,” said Head Coach Sarah Behn. Bruno added 12 points in fast break offense, while limiting its opponent to just four. Behn added that her team’s strong start was important, but they must work on playing consistently. “We probably played 22 to 24 good minutes of basketball. We have to get that up into the 30s.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Although the Bears turned over the ball 17 times, they ultimately were able to find success in their rebounding, collecting 55 boards, compared to Central Connecticut’s 41. Forward Janie White ’18 was the leading rebounder for the Bears, gathering eight. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Guard Taylor Will ’19 was once again crucial to Brown’s success, contributing 21 points, seven rebounds and four assists in the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears looked to continue the hot start to their season<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sunday against Cal. The Golden Bears (2-1) came into the matchup ranked 20th nationally. Behn noted that her team’s confidence was encouraging. “I’m proud of the kids because they weren’t intimidated. They followed the game plan … and they did everything I asked.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno’s game plan, described by Behn as “space out the floor, take a lot of threes and see if we can get some offensive boards,” was clear from the opening minutes of the game. The team took 41 three-point shots total and made 16 of them. Cal was just four of 16 from three. Guard Shayna Mehta ’19 was automatic from beyond the arc, going nine of 15 from three-point range. Her nine three-pointers set a single-game school record and her 33 points are a career high and the eighth most in a single game in Brown history. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown’s impressive efficiency on three-point shooting allowed them to stay in the game alongside their top-ranked opponent. Bruno trailed by just two points going into the half and kept the deficit small until the final minutes of the game.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Coach Behn expressed frustration with foul calls, noting that her team took and made just five free throws, while the Golden Bears made 17 free throws on 30 attempts. Bruno committed 22 fouls, while Cal only gave 10. “I feel like if those numbers were a little more similar, it would’ve been different,” Behn said. She added that she was forced to sit key players during crucial stretches of the game because they were in foul trouble over calls that Behn did not agree with.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears were out-rebounded by their opponent 58 to 31, and were hard-pressed to protect the rim, allowing 46 points in the paint. “We didn’t have great options today because they’re hard to guard. We couldn’t stop the bleeding with the defensive rebounds. It was tough,” Behn said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cal shot well enough on its last few free throws to ultimately pull away from the Bears, but Behn sees the upside in this loss against formidable opposition. “I hope that we learn from this game and get better with rebounding, I hope that this helps us in Ivy play. Each game we’re growing and taking things that are positive and things that we can work on,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team is back in action next week over the holiday break, traveling to Stockton, California, for the Thanksgiving Turkey Tip-Off Tournament. The Bears will face off against Hampton University Nov. 24 in their first game of the tournament. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The women’s basketball team (4-1, 0-0 Ivy) traveled to California to win the Pacific’s Turkey Tip-Off Tournament over the weekend. After taking down Hampton University 73-66, Brown advanced to the finals to beat the hosting University of California at Berkeley 74-57. Co-captain forward Erika Steeves ’19 registered her first double-doubles of the season in the tournament, scoring a total of 26 points and collecting 33 rebounds over the weekend.</p>
<p class="p2">For her back-to-back double-doubles and achieving a personal-best 19 rebounds in one game, Steeves was named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Herald: Congratulations on winning the Pacific’s Turkey Tip-Off Tournament! How did the victory feel?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Steeves: Thank you! It was amazing. We knew it was two really big games, and so it was a momentum shift for us.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>When did you first start playing basketball?</b></p>
<p class="p2">When I was seven or eight years old. My brother was a basketball player and so was my dad. I started playing with both of them. My dad was my coach for a while. I’m from Canada, so I went to prep school for basketball and soccer and academics. My brother went with me too — he’s 15 months older — so he left to play at Harvard for four years, and I ended up here.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>When did you first really get into basketball?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I was a big sports person in general growing up, and when I went to prep school, we had to play two sports. I did soccer, basketball, and I ran track. I was a sophomore, I got a big concussion playing soccer, and I decided to stop, and I think that’s the time I went more towards basketball.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Has your family played a large role in developing your relationship with basketball?</b></p>
<p class="p2">It definitely helps that my brother is 6’7” and I’m 6’2”. So when people look at us, they’re like, ‘Volleyball or basketball family?’ And we had a basketball hoop growing up in our backyard, and so every time I came home from school, I’d be like, ‘Oh, let’s go shoot hoops!’ And it was never a serious workout, it was always just a fun thing. So I think it’s really when I got to prep school, that I really noticed the seriousness of it. Before that, it was always, ‘Aw, let’s go hang out with my brother and play basketball!’ They never pushed me into it. I easily could have been playing volleyball<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or soccer, but we’re a basketball family.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Was it always a goal to participate in college athletics?</b></p>
<p class="p2">It became a goal when I got to prep school, and I saw everyone around me striving towards that, and it was really motivating to me to see my brother go play at Harvard. He unfortunately tore his ACL and was out for three years, so when I was trying to get recruited, he was talking to me about it, and he was like, ‘If you get the chance to play at an Ivy League school, you can’t pass it up.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m from Canada, I didn’t know anything about recruiting, I didn’t play (Amateur Athletic Union). I played for Team Québec back home, and I initially had no idea how to even go about talking to coaches. So my senior year, I reached out to a few coaches, I sent a few highlights, and they were like, ‘We’re really interested, but we’re filled, we have everybody,’ because I was a little late. I was kind of bummed. I got a few Division III offers, did a few different visits, which were awesome, but eventually I decided I wanted to play Division I basketball and I took a post-grad year at Phillips Exeter. I had a great year, had a great summer of playing AAU, got a few offers, and then was so happy I committed to Brown.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p2">When I first came here I loved it. It was beautiful out, and when the coach reached out to me, that’s the first thing that I remembered. I was like, ‘It was so pretty.’ I didn’t commit for that, obviously. I had a five-school tour planned out, four Ivies and one Patriot League school, and Brown was the first one I visited. I spent the day here and went out to lunch with the coaches, met a few of the girls, and then I committed that day. I called all the other schools and I was like, ‘Uh, I’m sorry, I’m committed. Awkward. I was supposed to come to you tomorrow, but I’m not.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think it was just a feel for the place, the coaching staff, the team, and it’s kind of like the cheesy, ‘When you get here, you just know.’</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What’s the best part about being a member of the basketball team?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I think that as a culture, we’ve really changed. My freshman year I came in, it was a lot about playing time, and I think there was a lot of tension on the team, but as a culture, throughout my three years here and with the new coach, it’s just become actually a family. And I never really thought that that would be real. Because everybody says it, ‘It’s your second family,’ but I actually just spent American Thanksgiving in San Francisco with my team, my coaches, and it was really like a family Thanksgiving. One of my teammates, (Shayna Mehta ’19), her family opened up their home to us, and it was really fun. It was such a great atmosphere.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How is the team feeling as tournament and out of league play starts shifting towards Ivy League play?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I think we’re all excited. We also feel like every game that we play in the preseason is really getting us ready for the Ivy League, which ultimately is the biggest part of our season. But these games are also really important. For example, this past tournament, we had some freshmen step up, a sophomore come off the bench and hit two huge threes. We just know we have a lot of girls that can participate, help us out, and we are more of a veteran team now, so I think that going into Ivy play, we’re definitely really excited to rely on our veterans and rely on our leadership and honor seniority and know that it’ll help us out when we get to the big, fourth-quarter-tie-game kind of thing.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you have any aspirations post-college to play professionally or for Team Canada?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I definitely want to eventually play for Team Canada — it’s one of my goals. I think I might also want to play pro, but overseas. My first language is French, so I feel like if I were to play, you know, France or West of Switzerland or something like that, where they do speak French, that would be really cool. And I’m studying international-relations/econ, and I think it would be interesting to play overseas and either get a job on the side or continue my studies there because I could mix both of my worlds up there.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears will take the courts at Providence College on Saturday, Dec. 2 at 12:00 p.m.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The men’s basketball team has not defeated the University of Rhode Island since 2011, and it was clear from the opening tip that the most recent chapter of this fierce Ocean State rivalry would not go Bruno’s way. The Rams, who were last season’s Atlantic 10 Conference champions and advanced to the round of 32 in the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament, dominated in almost all statistical categories in their 24 point victory against the Bears.</p>
<p class="p2">“URI played well,” said Travis Fuller ’19. “They are a very tough defensive team.”</p>
<p class="p2">The game got out of hand for Brown (4-3) before anyone in the arena could blink, as the Rams (4-2) jumped out to an early 20-7 lead behind 56 percent shooting and 13 points from Fatts Russell off the bench on 3-3 three point shooting in the first half.</p>
<p class="p2">Desmond Cambridge ’21 carried the load early for the Bears, contributing nine points and making all three of Brown’s three point shots in the first half. The rest of the team went 0-9 from beyond the arc in the first 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="p2">At the half, the Rams led 43-25 as the Bears only shot 28 percent from the field and had nine turnovers compared to URI’s four. The Rams also recorded five blocks, while Bruno did not record any.</p>
<p class="p2">The second half was more of the same in a game that was already long out of reach. Although Brandon Anderson ’20 caught fire with 13 second-half points on 5-9 shooting, the team was still only able to connect on 39 percent of its field goals and 29 percent of its three point shots. Meanwhile, the Rams shot an explosive 67 percent from the field and 50 percent from three.</p>
<p class="p2">When the final buzzer rang, the Rams led the Bears in shooting percentage 61 to 34, three point shooting percentage 63 to 26, rebounds 37-30, assists 16-11 and blocks 8-1. Anderson finished with 17 points and three assists while Cambridge added 16 points and two rebounds. Tamenang Choh ’21 notched a career-high eight points along with Jason Massey’s ’18 eight points on 4-5 shooting off the bench. The Bears shot well from the free-throw line, shooting 19-25 from the charity stripe compared to 7-14 shooting from the Rams.</p>
<p class="p2">Russell added seven second half points to his hot first half to finish with 20. Jared Terrell also finished with 16 points along with Jeff Dowtin’s 14. URI’s bench was also impressive throughout, as they outscored Bruno’s bench by 22 points.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite a tough loss to an intra-state rival, the Bears are still optimistic about the long season ahead and are sticking together as a team.</p>
<p class="p2">“Our biggest strength is how tight knit our team is,” Fuller said. “We are extremely connected both on the court and off. We’re a family that’s working hard to get better each and every day, which makes it a fun atmosphere.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears will return home to the Pizzitola Sports Center Saturday for a game against Central Connecticut State University at 2:00 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Returning home victorious after its trip to California to compete in the Turkey Tip-Off Tournament, the women’s basketball team looked to continue its winning ways Tuesday, facing off against Holy Cross. The Bears (5-1) defeated the Crusaders (3-3) 82-78 in a fast-paced and high-scoring matchup.</p>
<p class="p4">Holy Cross’ hot shooting streaks contributed to multiple swings in momentum, hitting 14 of 27 three-point attempts. The shots fell especially hard in the first half of the game, which helped the Crusaders jump out to a seven-point lead at the half with the score 39-32.</p>
<p class="p4">Brown Head Coach Sarah Behn felt the impact. “Mostly the difference in the game was how many threes they were making. … So when a team is that hot and we’re still able to find a win, I’m happy about that.”</p>
<p class="p4">Adjustments to adapt to the Crusader’s aggressive defense paid off for Bruno at halftime, as the team scored 50 points in the second half, compared to just 32 in the first. “They were putting a lot of zone on us, so we were just trying to work on our spacing and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>decision making,” Behn said. “We did a little bit better job in the second half.”</p>
<p class="p4">Guard Shayna Mehta ’19 not only provided an offensive spark for the Bears by dropping 28 points, but also was dominant on the defensive end, grabbing seven steals. Mehta energized Brown’s defensive effort, which led to multiple scoring opportunities. The Crusaders also turned the ball over 15 times, allowing the Bears to score 21 points off of those turnovers.</p>
<p class="p4">The final minutes of the close contest featured high-stakes free throw shooting from both teams. With 32 seconds left in the game, Holy Cross failed to convert on a free throw that would tie the game. Taylor Will ’19 found herself on the line with six seconds left, shooting a free throw that would put the game out of reach for the Crusaders. The final point of Will’s 12-point performance was tallied on a foul shot, which put the Bears ahead by four points to win the game. Will also grabbed 10 rebounds for Bruno.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Behn was ultimately pleased with her team’s balanced stat sheet and bench performance. Four players scored in the double-digits. Along with Mehta and Will, Justine Gaziano ’20 added 16 points and 5 rebounds and Janie White ’18 added 12 points, six rebounds, two assists and four blocks. “I was really happy with the bench,” Behn said. “I know some kids only played a few minutes, but they really helped us.” </span></p>
<p class="p4">The team looks to recharge after its cross-country trip and the high-energy game, shifting its focus to the Ocean State Tip Off tournament, hosted this weekend at Providence College. “Hopefully now we’re going to get our systems back because we’ve got a big weekend ahead,” Behn said. Brown’s first matchup of the tournament is Saturday against Providence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Blasberg &#039;18: Brady-Belichick tandem has Patriots at home in first place</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Everything is falling into place for both the Patriots and the rest of the NFL.</p>
<p class="p2">Entering Week 13, all is well in New England. The Pats have a 9-2 record and are sitting pretty atop the American Football Conference East. Teams that posed a threat early in the season have all stumbled to mediocrity. Tom Brady is healthy. Rob Gronkowski is healthy. And the defense has corrected its early mistakes. With four out of their remaining five games against soft AFC East opponents, the Patriots will earn a first-round bye in the playoffs and advance to play Pittsburgh in the Conference Championship game. It’s all so simple, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Every NFL season seems to begin with a great degree of uncertainty. The flurry of offseason moves, coupled with how little the preseason games indicate, makes any early-season speculation essentially meaningless. Sure, it is fun to watch your team win on opening day or to be first in their division for a few weeks. But the first quarter of the season, this year in particular, reveals very little about who will be playoff contenders. The true litmus test of a playoff football team is if it has the right people in the two most important places: head coach and quarterback.</span></p>
<p class="p2">This theory is most apparent in the AFC East. Despite being mired in the shadow of the Patriots for the better part of two decades, the Jets, Bills and Dolphins actually had respectable starts to the season. The Jets and Dolphins had 3-3 and 4-2 records, respectively, through six weeks and the Bills started their season 5-2. Almost on cue, though, each of those teams has given way to other contenders with better head coaches and stronger quarterbacks. The Jets and Dolphins have both lost five straight while the Bills have lost three of their last four games. Meanwhile, the Patriots, who were even with the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dolphins through six games have won seven straight. Everything is right in the NFL at the moment. The cream has risen to the top, while the bad teams have reverted to their losing ways.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A glance at this season’s successful teams, like the Patriots, Steelers, Saints and Panthers, reveals organizations that have good coaches and good quarterbacks. Most other teams struggle due to a revolving door at those two key roles, yet they perpetuate their losing ways by ousting their staff and players after poor seasons.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Eagles have been remarkable this year in that they don’t fit the mold. The team has a league-best 10-1 record with a second-year quarterback in Carson Wentz and a head coach, Doug Pederson, who is in his first season with the team. Acknowledging that the Eagles are the exception and not the rule, this NFL season has gone according to script. Many teams enter the season with high hopes, but the only teams that have staying power have the right people in the two most important roles.</span></p>
<p class="p2">While each individual football game is still exciting to watch, tracking an entire campaign is dull and monotonous because of the very basic script each season follows. In the past 14 seasons, just four different quarterbacks have represented the AFC in the Super Bowl. But as a New Englander, I am okay with that. This simple formula for NFL seasons has given me many enjoyable fall and winter afternoons watching my beloved Patriots thump the opposing “tomato cans” on a weekly basis. I will continue to enjoy spending my Sundays this way until a team can devise a new formula to win or until a new great quarterback/coach duo surfaces. But for now, everything in the NFL is in its right place.</p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Oklahoma City struggles: growing pains or cause for concern?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Oklahoma City Thunder was widely expected to be a Western Conference contender this season, buoyed by offseason additions Paul George and Carmelo Anthony. Instead, the Thunder has struggled in the early stages of the season, showing inconsistent effort throughout. Saturday’s loss to the Dallas Mavericks and Wednesday’s defeat at the hands of the Orlando Magic were Oklahoma City’s worst games yet — with the victories, the Mavericks and Magic improved their records to 5-15 and 9-13, respectively. Oklahoma City continues to lose to some of the league’s worst teams and currently holds a poor 8-12 record. If the season ended today, the Thunder would not be in the playoffs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fortunately, the season does not end today, and Oklahoma City still has time to fix its multitude of problems. Foremost is the need for better ball movement, especially in the closing minutes of close games. Russell Westbrook has continued to hog the ball in crunch time, allowing defenses to load up against the point guard. In Oklahoma City’s loss to the Detroit Pistons, the Thunder were down by one point with about five seconds remaining. Westbrook took the inbound pass and immediately chucked up a three that missed. Wild Westbrook will not lead the team to success — Oklahoma City needs to stress passing to role players throughout the game (and not just to collect triple-doubles) in order to build up good habits for when it matters most.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The second issue is three-point shooting. The Thunder is currently hitting 34.5 percent of their long-range shots, a mark that ranks 25th in the league. In such a three-point heavy league, the 25th ranked team will never be able to compete for a top playoff spot. For comparison, the Golden State Warriors rank second, the Boston Celtics 11th and the Cleveland Cavaliers 12th. The Thunder has to find a way to climb back up the ranks — they are sandwiched by two of the NBA’s worst teams in the standings — the Brooklyn Nets in 24th place and Chicago Bulls in 26th.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The last problem is the team’s road performance thus far. The Thunder is 3-8 away from Oklahoma City and its frenzied home fanbase. The team clearly feeds off the crowd’s energy in big games — take the win over the Warriors for example — but has shown difficulty replicating its hectic and intense efforts for away contests. The Thunder was especially lackadaisical in the Mavericks game, scoring only 81 points in total and falling way behind in the second quarter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Clearly, the Thunder has a lot to improve upon. But even though the sports media world has collectively soured on Oklahoma City, Thunder fans should not be quite so quick to hit the panic button.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Westbrook may not be passing enough late in games, but he has been conditioned by his famed triple-double hunt of the 2016-17 season. It will take time to adjust from that singular offensive mindset. Additionally, Westbrook must adapt to his two new star teammates. Super teams do not gel in an instant. The Miami Heat started off only 9-8 to kick off the “Big Three” era with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. But that team came out on the other side just fine, recording four consecutive trips to the Finals and two championships. The Cleveland Cavaliers, after the return of James and the addition of Kevin Love, began its season with a 19-20 record before the organization traded for J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert and Timofey Mozgov to help the team turn around. They have since reached the Finals three times and won once. The Thunder should not worry about its record just yet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The three-point shooting can improve as well. There are a few backup players who have the potential to shoot far better than their current marks — namely Alex Abrines, Josh Huestis and Jerami Grant. If Westbrook can rein in his tendency to shoot threes, then Oklahoma City can at least crack into the 15th rank range — in the middle pack of the NBA. With its athleticism and defensive potential, the Thunder needs to be only average from three to compete.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the end, Oklahoma City still has a ton of premier talent on the floor, and its dominant 108-91 victory over the Warriors showed the heights that this team can reach. Paul George is playing like a Defensive Player of the Year candidate, recording 2.8 steals per game. Carmelo Anthony is finding himself in this new offense — shooting 37.1 percent from three so far, a number that would be his best since the 2013-14 season. Westbrook remains one of the sport’s greatest forces. He recorded 34 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists in the win over Golden State. He can be even better if he just resists the temptation for more triple-doubles. There has been a lot of bad in Oklahoma City, but some good is hidden there too.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Only 4.5 games separate the Thunder from the fourth-seeded Portland Trail Blazers. Obviously, there are a bunch of teams that separate them as well, but the season is far,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>far from over. A five game-winning streak would silence a lot of the doubts and cement this team in postseason contention. Personally, I would bet on that hot streak coming sooner rather than later.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through 21 games, the New York Knicks, with a record of 11-10 and the seventh-best point differential in the Eastern Conference, have substantially outperformed their preseason projections. FiveThirtyEight’s CARMELO ratings pegged the Knicks for just 30 wins at the start of the season. Just about a quarter of the way through the year, New York has already improved its forecast by seven wins and boosted its chance of making the playoffs to 29 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Much of the team’s success can be attributed to Kristaps Porzingis making the leap to stardom in his third season. But Frank Ntilikina, New York’s rookie point guard and last year’s eighth overall pick, has generated his own share of buzz — and for good reason. Ntilikina, who stands at 6’5” with a 7-foot wingspan, has made an immediate impact defensively. The Knicks defend about a point better per 100 possessions with the rook on the floor, per NBA.com, and Ntilikina has racked up the highest steal percentage of any rookie guard with more than 100 minutes played, according to Basketball Reference’s Play Index.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But for all his defensive prowess, Ntilikina has struggled mightily on offense to start his career. Of the NBA’s most highly-touted rookie point guards — including Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, De’Aaron Fox and Dennis Smith Jr. — Ntilikina owns the lowest assist percentage, the highest turnover percentage and the second-worst true shooting percentage. Ntilikina is a 19-year-old with less than 400 NBA minutes under his belt, so it’s far from time to panic about his development. Still, for a New York team that’s banking on the Porzingis-Ntilikina pairing to drag the franchise out of mediocrity, it’s worth asking: What is reasonable to expect out of Ntilikina’s career?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">To get a grasp of how guards with playing styles similar to Ntilikina’s progressed after their rookie seasons, I dug up the statistics of every first-year guard that appeared in at least thirty games since the beginning of the three-point era (the 1979-1980 season) using the Play Index. I used model-based clustering to identify the three different “types” of guards: non-shooting playmakers, who tend to boast high assist totals and rate well defensively; shooting playmakers, who compensate for their lack of defensive skill with ability to space the floor; and combo guards who shoot, rebound and defend, but do little to make their teammates better.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">With his relatively high assist and three-point attempt rates, Ntilikina’s offensive potential fits that of a shooting playmaker, though he has exhibited more defensive potential than is typical of that type of player. Contemporary shooting playmakers include stars like Damian Lillard, Stephen Curry and Isaiah Thomas. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Those comparables seemed too broad, so I drilled deeper by finding rookie guards classified as shooting playmakers who posted three-point, free throw, usage, rebounding, assist, turnover and steal tendencies in Ntilikina’s range. Using this methodology yields a list of guards who made their debuts at age 22 and over — like Nando De Colo, Steve Blake and Phil Pressey. But a pair of younger players stand out from the list: Jrue Holiday and Jamal Crawford, who entered the league at 19 and 20, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">As rookies, Holiday and Crawford displayed the same mix of high three-point attempt volume, low free-throw frequency and spotty playmaking that Ntilikina has over his first 18 games. They’re also both tall, long defenders, unlike many of the other guards clustered as shooting playmakers. The one major caveat: Neither Holiday nor Crawford was as bricky in their first year as Ntilikina has been shooting from the perimeter. Holiday shot 39 percent from three and 76 percent from the free throw line as a rookie, while Crawford shot 35 percent and 79 percent, respectively. Ntilikina’s shooting numbers currently sit at just 25 percent from three and 64 percent from the line. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">He has only attempted 32 total threes and 14 free throws this season, so it’s possible that despite the pre-draft concerns about his shooting, Ntilikina’s true perimeter accuracy is closer to that of Holiday and Crawford than his present stats indicate. It might be smart to think of Holiday and Crawford as best-case scenarios for Ntilikina’s offensive development, players representative of his ceiling should he turn into a reliable deep threat. With that in mind, here’s a chart of Holiday and Crawford’s offensive output by age as measured by Offensive Box Plus-Minus, a stat from Basketball Reference that estimates a player’s offensive contributions in points per 100 possessions above or below average.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Considering his defensive prowess, if Ntilikina can reach the 1.5 to 2.5 OBPM range that Holiday and Crawford began occupying around their fourth seasons, he’ll be a borderline all-star and a key two-way cog that can mesh with any set of teammates seamlessly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It’s likely Ntilikina will approach Holiday’s aptitude as a playmaker — he already possesses solid vision and his decision-making and ball security will improve as he matures into his early 20s. The concern is that his jump shot never materializes into a real weapon, clogging vital passing and driving lanes on offense. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Ntilikina will always have a role as a defensive ace, especially as he fills out and learns the intricacies of NBA-level defense. But the Knicks didn’t pass on Smith at pick number eight to draft a defensive stopper without elite athleticism and a broken jumper, particularly as the NBA continues to place more value on the three-point shot than ever. <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">New York needs at least one more star to pair with Porzingis to become a factor in the east, a task that will become daunting if Ntilikina’s icy shooting proves to be symptomatic of something more than teenage growing pains. Ntilikina’s defense and passing alone gives him a high floor, but for the Knicks to challenge Boston and Philadelphia in a few years, he’ll need to develop into a threat from distance.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Forty days out from its first competition of the 2018 season, the gymnastics team is more prepared than ever. Led by co-captains Maggie McAvoy ’18 and Claire Ryan ’18, the Bears put up solid performances in a mock meet Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The preseason competition marked the first time the gymnasts faced judges since competing at USA Gymnastics Collegiate Nationals in April, where Brown fell short of qualifying for the finals after finishing fifth in preliminaries. An uncharacteristic fourth-place finish at the Ivy League Championship and a third-place ranking at the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championship last season left the team feeling like there was room for improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I don’t think we really finished where we wanted to finish,” McAvoy said. “We didn’t even make it to the second night of competition at Nationals, and we’d done that the year before and broken a ton of records. To come in last year and kind of flop was really disappointing because we had set a lot of high goals for ourselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But things appear to be looking up this season as McAvoy and Ryan work to maintain a positive vibe during workouts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This year, it’s already a 180,” she said. “It’s such a different environment and it’s such a great environment to come into every day.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the atmosphere in the gym has changed, the team’s goals remain the same — winning Ivy and ECAC crowns, qualifying individual athletes to NCAA Regionals and earning a berth to USAG Nationals for the sixth consecutive year. But head coach Sara Carver-Milne’s primary focus is ensuring the gymnasts stay composed on the competitive stage. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Overall, our main goal is consistency,” she said. “We have the talent. We have the work ethic. We just need to work on being consistent and handling the pressure well in every single competition this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Twelve members of the team have experience under pressure in college, but five first-years will be tested for the first time in Bruno’s opening meet against Rhode Island College and the College of Brockport, State University of New York. Carver-Milne is confident in the rookies’ ability to make an impact early. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They’ve really bonded well with our team and our system,” she said. “There’s no doubt that they’ll contribute immediately on all events, and we’re excited to see what they can do.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The absence of standout all-arounders Caroline Morant ’17 and Jorden Mitchell ’17 leaves gaps in the Bears’ lineups, but Alyssa Gardner ’21 and Kate Nelson ’21 have the ability to post big scores for Bruno on all four events while Emma Hansen ’21 and Caroline Warren ’21 can make contributions on uneven bars and balance beam. As a “natural beam worker” according to Carver-Milne, Rose Domonoske ’21 will also help the Bears out on the event that evoked nervous mistakes last season. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Veteran competitors like Julia Green ’19, Anne Christman ’20 and Anya Olson ’18 will also play large roles in the team’s success. Green earned Second Team USAG All-American honors on vault in 2017 and boasts creative skills on beam and floor, where she is expected to receive high marks. Christman has been rock solid “since day one,” according to McAvoy, and will contribute on multiple events this season. After placing second on bars at Nationals and capturing USAG All-American honors in the event, Olson will cap off her season by anchoring her strongest event and adding solid performances on vault and floor. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will have a chance to show off their skills in front of home crowds multiple times this season as they host their annual Beauty and the Beast meet with the wrestling team Feb. 4 and another regular-season meet March 4. But the competition Bruno is most looking forward to is the Ivy Classic Feb. 25, which Brown hosts for the first time in four years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re extremely excited,” Carver-Milne said. “The last time we hosted, we won. It would be an incredible opportunity for our team to keep that trophy at Brown again.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following a 10-day hiatus over the Thanksgiving break, the men’s hockey team earned its first overtime victory of the season with a 5-4 comeback win over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Saturday. The victory earned Bruno another weekend split, as the Bears fell to No. 19 Union 3-1 Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tommy Marchin ’19 led the Bears with five points over the weekend, scoring Bruno’s lone goal Friday and earning a hat trick and an assist against RPI Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 1, Union 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday night, Marchin scored late in the third period, but the Bears (5-6-0, 3-6-0 ECAC) were unable to recover from a three goal deficit. Three different Dutchmen (9-7-1, 6-2-0) notched goals, one in each stanza, to claim the lead.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They were running a really good forecheck on our breakout that we weren’t used to,” Marchin said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno gained offensive momentum later in the contest, outshooting Union in the second and third periods to claim a total shot advantage of 32-28.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Marchin put the Bears on the board with five minutes remaining, collecting a stray rebound off the skate of Tim Lappin ’18 and slotting the puck past Union netminder Jake Kupsky.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno came out strong on the penalty kill, holding the Dutchmen at 0-for-4 on the power play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We had plenty of chances to score in that game — I don’t think there was a lack of energy at the beginning,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “If anything, we have to make sure that we are disciplined in not taking needless penalties.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears pulled goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 for an extra skater with 1:50 remaining, but were closed out by the Dutchmen in the final stretch. Nieto made 25 saves in the contest.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 5, Rensselaer 4 / OT</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, a three-goal third period powered the Bears to a comeback victory over the Engineers (3-10-3, 2-5-1). Marchin earned a hat trick and Lappin scored the golden goal a minute and a half into overtime for the win.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It all begins with the fact that the guys believed that we had the ability to be able to come back,” Whittet said. “We stuck with the process … and played with confidence in understanding that the game is not over until the final horn goes off. It was really a character-building win.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno burst out to an early lead at the 20 second mark as Marchin scored on the first shot of the game, launching the puck past RPI goaltender Linden Marshall from the left circle.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rensselaer answered with a trio of goals in the second period, including one on the power play, to reclaim the advantage. The Engineers widened the lead to three with a shorthanded goal 10 seconds into the third.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Bruno began to mount a rally midway through the final stanza when Marchin scored twice in a four minute span, capitalizing on a power play in the 16th minute to trim the deficit to one.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chris Berger ’21 equalized the game a minute later, redirecting a rebound past Marshall for his first career goal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Once we got one, the bench came alive,” Marchin said. “We knew that we had the potential to actually come back and had plenty of time to do so, so we were pretty confident in ourselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lappin fired a shot from the right circle off the crossbar and into the back of the net to claim the victory in overtime.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rensselaer slighted Brown 31-30 in shots on goal. Nieto made 27 saves in the win.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking ahead, the Bears seek to maximize offensive output on the power play, which has converted seven times so far this season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our penalty kill has probably been a little bit ahead of our power play, although last night, our power play came through in a big way,” Whittet said. “I look at that and say that the power play performed in that situation — it was a pressure situation and it was good to see.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m really confident that we have good guys on units (on the power play) that know how to score goals and work together really well,” Marchin said. “We’re just going to stick to the process and the pucks will start coming our way.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With two non-conference games remaining before the winter break, Bruno also looks to maintain the greater depth and cohesiveness that has helped the team to five wins early in the season. “We’re getting contributions throughout — people stepping in that may not have been playing and coming in and contributing,” Whittet said. “It’s a team in every aspect.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears host Bentley Wednesday in a non-conference matchup at Meehan Auditorium. Face-off is at 7 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s basketball team had not played in three days after a brutal stretch of three games in four days last week, but its much-needed rest looked more like rust in a 68-62 loss against Central Connecticut State University at home Saturday. The Bears led by 12 at one point in the second half, but turnovers and cold shooting down the stretch doomed Brown to its second consecutive loss. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have got to be able to learn from all of our experiences, positive and negative,” said Head Coach Mike Martin ’04. “I’m sure there were some good things that happened out there, but we didn’t do enough to win a game.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Desmond Cambridge ’21, who was named last week’s Ivy League Rookie of the Week, came out early and put the scoring load on his shoulders. Cambridge made three three-point shots in the first seven minutes of the contest, accounting for nine out of Brown’s (4-4) 13 early points. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Desmond has a lot of talent, and he’s going to be a good player,” Martin said. “But we win as a team and lose as a team.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Blue Devils (5-3) rode early shooting consistency and a clear rebounding advantage to stay competitive, eventually taking a 23-19 lead with just over four minutes left in the half. After Brandon Anderson ’20,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Zach Hunsaker ’20 and Cambridge reentered the game, Bruno caught fire and was able to create open shots, create mistakes with strong defense and retake the lead with a 10-0 scoring run.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the half, the Bears were ahead 31-27. Cambridge and Anderson led in scoring with 11 and nine points, respectively. Hunsaker helped with two rebounds and two assists, and Tamenang Choh ’21 added three boards. Mustafa Jones led CCSU in scoring in the first 20 minutes with seven points. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno and the Blue Devils matched each other in terms of first-half shooting, with both squads notching an identical 12-27 mark from the field. CCSU commanded in rebounds, grabbing eight more boards than the Bears and fighting for seven second-chance points. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Blue Devils came out after halftime and made an early three-point shot to cut the lead to one, but the Bears settled in and appeared to take control of the game. Cambridge ignited the Pizzitola Center with two three-point shots, extending the Brown lead to twelve 2:49 into the half. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But a CCSU scoring run, powered by suffocating defense, made the 12 point deficit vanish with just 7:14 remaining in the contest, when the Blue Devils tied the game at 54. With four minutes left in the game, CCSU took their first lead of the half on a jump shot from Austin Nehls. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The game continued as a back-and-forth affair, but with 2:18 left in the game, Nehls made a three-pointer that extended the Blue Devils’ lead to four. With 48 seconds left, Eric Bowles made two free throws to put the game out of reach for the Bears. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno shot 37 percent from the field and 32 percent from beyond the arc. Cambridge led all Brown scorers with 17 points along with 15 from Anderson and 14 from Hunsaker. The Blue Devils dominated in rebounds 44-23 and points in the paint 32-16. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have a young team and we have to learn from all of our experiences,” Martin said. “Unfortunately, our team was not as good as we needed to be today.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will return to the court to face cross-town rival Providence College Wednesday at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center before returning home to play the University of Massachusetts-Lowell Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following a series of non-conference matchups over the winter break, the men’s basketball team claimed its first victory over Yale since 2014 with an 81-80 home win<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Friday night. Clutch free-throw shooting in the final minutes propelled Bruno to its first Ivy League victory of the season. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re excited to get our first Ivy win under our belt,” said Travis Fuller ’19. “We lost (to Yale) the week before and had a great week of preparation, so it feels great to see our hard work pay off.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The score tilted back and forth between the storied Ivy League rivals in the first half. The Bears (8-7, 1-1 Ivy) were able to take advantage of the stubborn defense of Zach Hunsaker ’20 and the flashy layups of Brandon Anderson ’20 to a 30-22 lead with five minutes left in the first period. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">But the Bulldogs (8-10, 1-1), who are just two years removed from winning the Ivy League crown and pulling off an upset in the first round of the NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Tournament, started to heat up in the final minutes of the half. Trey Phills finished the half with 10 points, leading the way for Yale on a 14-point run that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reclaimed the advantage for the Bulldogs. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the half, Yale led Brown 38-33. Bruno shot 43 percent from the field, grabbed 13 rebounds and shot 36 percent from beyond the three-point arc in the first period. Anderson and Joshua Howard ’20 both led the Bears with nine points each. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno came out of halftime prepared, and surged to a 43-42 lead after a technical foul on Desmond Cambridge ’21. But the Bulldogs quickly returned to form, taking advantage of Bruno’s turnovers and hitting a contested three-point shot to take a seven-point lead with just under 15 minutes left in the contest. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown answered back, continuing to drive to the basket and play strong defense to claw its way back into the game. After a strong and-one layup by Jason Massey ’18 and two three-point shots from Cambridge, the Bears tied the game at 61 with just eight minutes to play. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With four minutes left in the game, Tamenang Choh ’21 highlighted a strong scoring and passing night with a powerful one-handed dunk over Miye Oni to give the Bears a 69-65 lead. After a resurgence from Yale, Cambridge tied the game at 72 with less than two minutes to play. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Obi Okolie ’19<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>hit a three-point shot with 1:10 on the clock to break the tie and give the Bears a 75-72 lead. Just 18 seconds later, Yale’s Alex Copeland hit an and-one layup and a free throw to tie the thrilling game again at 75. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the game raced to a conclusion, it became clear that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>free-throw shooting would determine its outcome. Anderson was fouled and sunk both free throws to give the Bears a two-point lead with 44 seconds remaining. After Yale hit two more free throws, the Bears got the ball back in a tied game 11 seconds later. Okolie got fouled on a jump shot with five seconds left and sunk both shots at the charity stripe to give the Bears a 79-77 lead. After Yale’s Oni missed a potential game-tying alley-oop layup with 2.5 seconds left, Okolie’s clutch free throws finally secured the much-needed victory. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Proud of our Bears for the grit and determination our young men showed tonight,” wrote Head Coach Mike Martin ’04 on Twitter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Huge contributions from everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears made 49 percent of their shots from the field and 37 percent from beyond the three-point arc for the game. The Brown bench bounced back in the second half, scoring 26 points. Cambridge led all Bears in scoring with 16 points followed by Okolie and Choh who recorded 12 points each. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Some keys to victory for us were how we played together as a team and continued to fight together as a team,” Hunsaker said. “We have a lot to improve on. We really have to continue to focus on the defensive end and then just execute on offense.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking ahead, Fuller emphasized his confidence in the team’s development. “We are going to continue to grow as a team,” Fuller said. “I’m confident that we can beat any team in the Ivy League.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will host Dartmouth Friday and Harvard Saturday at the Pizzitola Center. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The women’s squash team earned its second straight win last Thursday with a 9-0 victory over Dickinson College. The team, ranked 11th in the nation, was led by Hannah Seckendorf ’20. Playing in the number one slot, Seckendorf fought back from a two-game deficit in a best-of-five sets match to claim victory.</p>
<p class="p2">Seckendorf, a sophomore from New York, also won a match by three sets to one in a 7-2 victory over No. 16 Amherst College two days prior. For her outstanding performance this season, Seckendorf has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the win last week. How did it feel to fight back and win in a tough match?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Seckendorf: It’s definitely tough mentally. I know many other people on my team who struggle with negative self-talk on the court when things start to not go in their direction. But what’s really helpful is that each court has three people that play on it, so every time I come off the court I have teammates that sit me down, coach me and help me get out of my own head. We also recently got a new assistant coach, Arthur (Gaskin), who is definitely helpful at taking that energy and making it into intensity and positive anger, rather than anger directed at myself.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Why did you choose to play squash? Were you involved in any other sports too?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I definitely sampled a bunch of sports. I loved ice hockey and gymnastics, but when I tried squash for the first time, I knew that it was what I wanted to do. I just stumbled upon it by chance, since neither of my parents played, but I loved it because it was really quick-paced, athletic and could be played in any season.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>When did you decide you wanted to play squash in college?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I suppose that I didn’t think about it much until I got to high school. I started to meet people who were a few years older than me in the Junior Squash Circuit and saw them go to college and love their college teams. I realized how cool it would be to have a team experience while in college. So, in my junior winter, I started the whole recruitment process, receiving and sending out emails and calling coaches.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I chose Brown mostly because, when I did my official visit, I fell in love with the team. I thought they were a bunch of nice, smart people who cared about both squash and their school work. I was really certain when I visited that this was the team dynamic that I wanted, since I think that is really crucial to being happy and performing well in a sport. I’d say the people make the place.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What’s your favorite part of playing squash at Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p2">My favorite part about it is to be with a mostly consistent small group of girls, to see them grow as athletes and to support each other in the process. Squash is an individual sport, and when I did it in high school, it was either individual or on the boys’ high school team, since I was the only girl in my high school that played squash. To be supported by and be able to support a bunch of female athletes has been really inspirational.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>The team is ranked 11th in the nation. Can you reflect on the season so far?</b></p>
<p class="p2">We had a really tough start to the season. We played Stanford University, Penn and Princeton back-to-back-to-back and traveled a lot. Those are all really strong teams, and we had <span class="s1">a surprising number of competitive matches against them. I think everyone rose to the occasion and played really well. But it also had the potential to be really hard on morale because we did lose all of those matches. But it was really cool to see that when we played both Amherst and Dickinson — opponents that were not so far out of our league — we were all ready to step it up. We showed a lot of respect to our opponents and a lot of respect to ourselves and played really well. So I’d say that we’re on the upswing right now. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>What are your personal and team goals for the rest of the season?</b></p>
<p class="p2">For personal goals, I’m trying to get a bit of a better hold on my mental game. You mentioned that I went down two games and came back to win three games, but I want to cut out the two games that I lost in the beginning. It requires a mental flip to do that, and I think that I could do that more efficiently. For the team, we have a lot of really close matches coming up against our two big rivals, Dartmouth and Cornell. I know that every year, we come really close, and last year we ended up losing to both of them at (the 2017 Women’s National Team Championships). I think that we’re going to come into the season with some revenge for those teams.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Do you have any aspirations to play squash after college?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Right now, I want to take a year to go pro. I don’t want to take more than a year, since I don’t see a future in professional squash. But the international squash community is really tight-knit, so I already know people in a bunch of different countries who play that would be willing to host me and would want to train me. So I’d love to take squash pro, partly as an excuse to travel the world and have that community. But also, I’ve never had the opportunity to solely focus on my athletics, since I’ve always been a student athlete. I’ve always been curious about how strong I could get and how fast I could get, and it would be cool to take a year and figure that out.</p>

		<title>Lauren Gibbs ’06 goes for gold</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Lauren Gibbs ’06 did not begin her athletic career on ice, but next month, she will represent Team USA as she competes at the 2018 Winter Olympics in women’s bobsled.</p>
<p class="p4">Upon receiving the news of her ticket to Pyeongchang, Gibbs felt “disbelief.”</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s incredible to work towards a goal for four years and achieve it,” she wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">Gibbs began her bobsled career in 2014 after a friend mentioned an open tryout. As she told Brown Athletics, a strong performance at the <span class="s3">combine that year earned her an invitation to a weeklong camp where she finished with the fastest time. Gibbs first made the national team during the 2014-15 season and has maintained that spot ever since. The 2018 Games will be Gibbs’ first Olympic experience. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Gibbs’ career has not always been smooth sledding. An adductor injury during the 2015-16 season hampered her summer training and set Gibbs back at the beginning of the season but did not stop her from staying on the national team and competing at the elite level.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though she is still relatively new to bobsledding, Gibbs has already amassed an impressive collection of hardware. In addition to her 11 World Cup medals, she also won bronze at the 2016 World Championships in Igls, Austria. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gibbs’ athletic accomplishments date back to her time at Brown where she found success on the volleyball court. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I was originally recruited for track and field,” she wrote. “When speaking to the coach, I didn’t want to do two seasons. I felt like it would be too much with school work. I was playing volleyball at the time as well, so I sent my recruiting tape to (former head coach) Diane Short. She liked what she saw and invited me for a visit. It was love at first sight.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gibbs was a three-year starter for the Bears and gained Second Team All-Ivy recognition in 2004 and 2005. With 1,090 career kills, she ranks fourth all-time in Brown volleyball history. She also earned Academic All-Ivy honors during her senior season. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While on College Hill, Gibbs learned that she “could do it all as long as I was willing to be dedicated to the things that mattered” and credits her work ethic and time management skills to being a student-athlete at Brown. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now that she’s reached the highest level of her sport, Gibbs’ days consist of sprints, weightlifting and treatment to stay in top shape. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In two weeks, all her training will be put to the test as she teams up with pilot Elana Meyers Taylor to race for the gold. Meyers Taylor is a two-time Olympic medalist, and the pair look to have a solid shot at the podium in South Korea. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As she goes on to represent Team USA and Brown at the Olympic level, Gibbs offered advice to student-athletes seeking a professional athletic career: “Find something you love and work hard at it every time you step on the court, field or ice.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Games officially begin Feb. 9 with the women’s bobsled competition set for Feb. 20 and 21. Gibbs and Meyers Taylor will face off against 19 other sleds, including fellow Americans, as they chase Olympic glory.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: The Hall snubs Bonds and Clemens again, thank goodness</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/26/hall-snubs-bonds-clemens-thank-goodness/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The calls went out just after 6 p.m. Wednesday night: Four new members were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Minutes later, MLB Network announced the news. And as it did, I breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I was happy, not so much for Chipper Jones, Vladimir Guerrero, Jim Thome and Trevor Hoffman — though all of these inductees were deserving — but rather, about the vote totals for candidates lower down on the list. Prior to the announcement, publicly available ballots showed Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, the two kingpins of baseball’s steroid era, trending upward by as much as 10 percent. But when the final vote came out, the jump was much smaller at around three. Both with vote shares near 54 percent on the 2017 ballot, Clemens’ and Bonds’ numbers rose to 57.3 percent and 56.4 percent, respectively — about as modest an increase as I could have hoped for.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I realize I have never directly addressed the steroid issue before, so let me make my position crystal clear. Steroid users do not belong in the Hall of Fame. Bonds and Clemens should remain on the ballot until their time on it expires. The Hall isn’t just a museum, as some claim; it is an honor. And no cheater deserves to be awarded the highest honor baseball bestows.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I can already hear the indignant responses, so I’ll address them. Some will ask, “But what about the other cheaters? What about Gaylord Perry?” Easy: He should never have been elected either. I don’t know what the Baseball Writers’ Association of America was thinking when it inducted him. And before you bring up another common argument, something as prevalent as stealing signs isn’t cheating, for the simple reason that it’s not against the rules — at least in its traditional form. But flagrant cheaters, whether they throw banned pitches or take banned substances, have no place in the Hall of Fame. We can’t kick them out, but we can stop electing them in the first place. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some, too, will argue that Bonds and Clemens would have been Hall of Fame material even without performance-enhancing drugs. I’ve never thought much of this argument. For one, it requires fans and voters to construct an entire hypothetical career based on a complex set of unknown medical circumstances. Who knows whether Sammy Sosa would have been a Hall of Famer without performance-enhancing drugs either — and if so, should we let him in as well? Additionally, this argument treats steroid use very strangely — it says that breaking the rules is fine as long as you’re good enough.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This runs counter to the fundamental notion of fairness. If a batter uses a corked bat and hits a home run, should he go without punishment if he’s so strong that the ball would have gone over the fence even without the cork? Of course not. The crime isn’t becoming a better player — the crime is breaking the rules. Clemens’ and Bonds’ natural talent is irrelevant here. They cheated and are now deservedly being punished for it, as cheaters should be.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some will argue that keeping Bonds and Clemens out of the Hall is an affront to history. They were the most important players of their generation, the argument goes: We can’t just pretend they didn’t exist. But we should not celebrate them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Do we really want to bestow an enormous honor on people just because they were historically significant? It’s not hard to recognize history without honoring it. We’ve preserved the story of Watergate in books, newspapers and movies; there’s no need to raise a plaque praising former president Richard Nixon. We won’t forget Bonds or Clemens either: We just don’t need to honor them. If the Hall of Fame were solely a museum, then of course they’d be included. But it’s not. There is a museum portion of the building; I’m fairly sure Bonds and Clemens, and objects related to them, are already featured there. But being elected and enshrined is a different matter. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, some people, in an attempt to strike some kind of balance, argue that Bonds and Clemens should be inducted, but their plaques should display their transgressions. Really? Is this what we want? “Barry Bonds, a possibly illegitimate slugger who set the all-time home run record while cheating…” or “Roger Clemens, seven-time Cy Young Award Winner who may have deserved some of them but certainly not all…” Absurd. If the violation is so bad that it has to be written on a player’s Hall of Fame plaque, it’s far better not to induct the player at all.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’ve been to the Baseball Hall of Fame once, in 2005, and I can tell you how truly wonderful it is. Right in the heart of Cooperstown, a beautiful village by Otsego Lake with a main street<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>right out of Disneyland, it really is a temple to the great American game that is baseball. And that beautiful building, a shrine to our national pastime, deserves the best: players who worked hard, who honed their talent and followed the rules. A ticket to Cooperstown — and a plaque in that building — is reserved for the best of the best. And there should never be any room for cheaters.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Childhood dreams came true for Brown track and field alum Evan Weinstock ’14 when he was selected to represent the United States in bobsled and skeleton at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The Las Vegas native will travel to Pyeongchang in February to compete as part of one of the three qualifying sleds.</p>
<p class="p4">“The Olympics has always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid,” Weinstock said, though he did not necessarily envision himself representing Team USA as a bobsledder.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s a very unique and obscure sport,” Weinstock laughed. “I always admired the Olympics and hoped to experience it for myself one day. I’m so very fortunate to be able to be going, and bobsled just happened to be my ticket in.”</p>
<p class="p4">Prior to bobsledding, Weinstock claimed four Ivy League track and field champion titles while at Brown, winning the decathlon in 2011, 2013 and 2014 and the heptathlon at the 2013 Indoor Heptagonal Championships. A senior year team captain, he still holds the school record in the decathlon with 7,393 points and ranks second in school history in the pentathlon with 5,296 points.</p>
<p class="p4">In the classroom, Weinstock explored several branches of science before deciding to study biology, with a particular interest in physiology and biotechnology. During his time at Brown, he also fulfilled the pre-med<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>requirements.</p>
<p class="p4">“I loved my experience at Brown,” Weinstock said. “It gave me the opportunities to pursue everything I wanted to pursue. … I was extremely competitive in both my athletic and my academic sense, and it was the perfect fit for me.”</p>
<p class="p4">Connections through Brown led Weinstock to bobsledding. In Weinstock’s freshman year, Craig Kinsley ’11, a former javelin thrower on the track and field team, was invited to try out for the USA bobsled team. Kinsley eventually threw javelin for Team USA in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and is now the assistant coach for throwing for the Bears. He was also the first to recommend bobsled to Weinstock.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“He knew the type of athlete I was,” Weinstock said, citing his well-rounded experience as a decathlete. “Bobsledders are typically very strong but also very fast. … Naturally, bobsled fit into (the) same style” as a decathlon.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Weinstock only began to consider Ki<span class="s4">nsley’s recommendation seriously a year after graduation. In 2015, Weinstock put his plans to go to medical </span>school on hold and tried out for the national bobsled team, a decision that launched the start of a young but decorated career. Participating in the North American Cup, European Cup and World Cup bobsled competitions, Weinstock has medalled several times since his inaugural 2015-16 season with Team USA. This winter will be Weinstock’s first time competing on the Olympic stage.</p>
<p class="p4">Months of dedicated training precede the games. “There’s a lot of things that go into the sport that are not exactly known,” Weinstock said. It’s “the stuff that’s off the ice that really takes the most time.”</p>
<p class="p4">When they are in season, bobsledders travel internationally from one competition location to the next, and their equipment goes with them. Most important are the sleds, which, being high-tech and finely engineered, require careful maintenance by the bobsledders to ensure peak performance capability. When arriving at a new location, attending to the sleds is the first and most time-consuming order of business. The bobsledders also create a makeshift gym in a parking garage or similar location for a lifting session. After lifting, the sled teams each get two practice runs down the racing track. “All the while, (we’re) getting our meals in, going to sleep,” Weinstock said. “That’s more or less a general, typical day in the bobsled world.”</p>
<p class="p4">In the last couple of weeks leading up to Pyeongchang, the U.S. bobsled team will shift its training focus from physical conditioning to ensuring that the members remain healthy. The bobsledders are “trying to make sure that our bodies are ready to be the best by the time the Olympics come around,” Weinstock said.</p>
<p class="p4">“I’m not really sure what to expect when I get” to the Olympics, Weinstock said, though the team will be familiar with its competition as they have raced against them all season.</p>
<p class="p4">“The atmosphere of the Olympics is what’s really going to make the whole experience what it is,” Weinstock added. “To see all the nations from all the other sports in the same village as me, and kind of on the same playing field, is really going to be something.”</p>
<p class="p4">To Olympic hopefuls and current Brown athletes with professional aspirations, Weinstock advised to “really pursue all sorts of avenues and opportunities that may come up. If it’s something you really want to achieve, attack it with everything you have — don’t hold anything back or take any opportunity for granted, because it could be your ticket to your ultimate goal.”</p>
<p class="p4">Weinstock said he is also grateful for the opportunities and the continued support that he receives from Brown. “I’m very excited that people are interested in my story, or interested in bobsledding,” he said. “I hope if they’re curious, they take a look, and hopefully I get a few more fans of the sport and help grow it.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Olympic men’s bobsled competitions will take place Feb. 18-25 in <span class="s3">Pyeongchang, South Korea.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3"> After splitting a series against Yale last weekend, the men’s basketball team bested Dartmouth on a buzzer-beating bucket from Zach Hunsaker ’20 Friday night before falling to Harvard Saturday. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears, who are now 2-2 in the Ivy League, are tied for 4th place, positioning them to make a run at the 2018 Ivy League Men’s Basketball Tournament in March. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 64, Dartmouth 62</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears’ thrilling victory after Hunsaker’s game-winning basket will not soon be forgotten by Brown fans and players alike. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was a great moment,” Hunsaker said. “It was definitely a moment that I will remember for the rest of my life, for sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears (9-8, 2-2 Ivy) were ready to play from the opening tip, and posted 63 percent field goal shooting en route to an early 13-2 lead just five minutes into the game. Dartmouth (4-13, 0-4) went just 0 for 6 on field goals in the same window.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno continued to dominate the Big Green as the first half continued and led 37-24 at halftime. Brandon Anderson ’20 paved the way, scoring nine first-half points. Desmond Cambridge ’21 notched eight points, including an alley-oop dunk that sent the Brown crowd into a frenzy. The team shot 43 percent from the field and managed to grab 23 rebounds. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Big Green heated up at the beginning of the second half, clawing its way back into the contest and narrowing Bruno’s lead to just one with 2:50 to play. Dartmouth continued to play strong defense to force missed shots and get the ball back at a one-point deficit with 15 seconds to go in the game. Will Emery was fouled with seven seconds remaining, and made his first free throw to tie the game at 62. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We didn’t play a great second half,” said Head Coach Mike Martin ’04. “Our first 20 minutes were outstanding and put us in a position where we were able to hold them off despite getting outplayed in the second half.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Emery missed his second shot at the charity stripe, and Hunsaker got the ball and began to sprint down the length of the court against Dartmouth’s transition defense. Hunsaker glided through traffic, and launched a strongly defended shot from the right side of the court that hit the backboard and rolled through the basket as the buzzer sounded. The shot fueled Brown’s 64-62 victory and sent the student section rushing onto the court. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m not ever going to be upset after a win, especially in the Ivy League,” Martin said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown finished the game shooting 38 percent from the field, with 38 rebounds and six steals. Anderson led scoring with 17 points, followed by Hunsaker who recorded 12 points.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 77, Harvard 86</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Crimson (9-10, 4-0) entered the contest Saturday on a sixteen-game winning streak against the Bears, and came out of the locker room firing on all cylinders. Harvard raced to a 13-0 lead in the first three minutes and shot three for three from beyond the arc. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Bruno was determined to work its way back into the game. After shutting down Harvard on offense, Brown’s shooters began to heat up. Tamenang Choh ’21 electrified the Pizzitola Sports Center with a thunderous alley-oop dunk to pull Brown within four points of the Crimson. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the half, Harvard led Brown 37-33. Both Anderson and Obi Okolie ’20<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>finished the half with nine points, and the team shot 41 percent from the field. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the second half began, lights-out shooting from Seth Towns gave the Crimson a 15 point lead. Towns would finish the game with 30 points. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Towns took over in the second half,” Martin said. “When they extended their lead to 15, a lot of that was because of him.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Cambridge would not let the Bears go down quietly. His two powerful dunks and three three-point bombs put the Bears back into the game and slimmed the Harvard lead to five with 11 minutes to play. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In the huddles, we just had to keep hustling and keep playing because the game is never over until it’s over,” Cambridge said. “I just had to make some shots, but it’s tough.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After going down by 12 with four minutes to play following Danilo Djuricic’s three-pointer, the Bears once again shot their way back into the contest, but could not complete the comeback attempt and fell 86-77. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cambridge finished leading all Brown scorers with 22 points, followed by Anderson with 19 points. The Bears shot 41 percent from the field, grabbed 28 rebounds and recorded 24 points in the paint. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will take to the road next weekend, facing Penn Friday and Princeton Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Following a five-game home stand during winter break, the men’s hockey team saw mixed results on the road this weekend, falling to St. Lawrence 3-2 Friday and drawing even with No. 3 Clarkson 2-2 in an overtime tilt Saturday.
Alec Mehr ’21, Zach Giuttari ’20 and Sam Lafferty ’18 led the Bears in the contests, posting a goal and an assist each.

<strong>Brown 2, St. Lawrence 3</strong>
Friday night, Giuttari and Mehr scored in the first two periods, but the Bears (6-12-4, 5-10-1 ECAC) were unable to maintain an advantage in a close duel with the Saints (6-18-2, 2-11-1).
Giuttari capitalized on a power play two minutes into the contest, firing a shot from the top of the left circle past Saints goaltender Arthur Brey. Max Gottlieb ’19 and Tommy Marchin ’19 recorded assists on the play.
St. Lawrence answered with an equalizer four and a half minutes later, but Bruno regained the lead late in the second period when Mehr redirected a mid-air rebound into the net. Mehr sent the puck past Brey on the right side after Brey made the initial stick save on a shot from Gottlieb.
Carson Gicewicz claimed the victory for the Saints with two unanswered goals in the second and third periods.
Bruno demonstrated strong command of its penalty kill, holding the Saints at 0-for-2 on the power play.
“All year we’ve done a really good job on the penalty kill, and this weekend clearly showed that,” Mehr said.
The Bears gained offensive momentum later in the contest, outshooting the Saints in the third period for a total shot advantage of 39-36. Rookie goaltender Luke Kania ’21 recorded 33 saves.

<strong>Brown 2, No. 3 Clarkson 2 (OT)</strong>
The following day, Lafferty and Tony Stillwell ’21 scored to send the Bears into overtime against the Golden Knights (19-4-3, 11-1-2).
Brown answered an early Clarkson goal late in the first period when Lafferty converted on the power play. Marchin collected a rebound and delivered the puck to Lafferty, who finished a shot from the left circle to even the game.
Clarkson responded with another goal two minutes into the second stanza, but Stillwell leveled the tally five minutes into the third period to keep the game alive heading into overtime. Stillwell launched the puck past Golden Knights netminder Jake Kielly off a pass from Giuttari through the slot for the equalizer.
Kania made 35 saves in the matchup as Clarkson outshot Brown 37-25.
“We were right there with them all night — it was a well-fought battle,” Mehr said. “If we just make small adjustments like just eliminating turnovers, we can definitely compete with them on a national stage here.”
Bruno was able to pressure the net and find success on the power play, converting twice over the weekend.
“We’ve been working a lot on the power play in practice and it’s been kind of a main focus for us for a while now,” Mehr said. “We got two goals, but I think the biggest thing is that we were just shooting pucks and getting to the front of the net.”
Brown also came out strong on the penalty kill, going 5-for-5 to improve to an 85 percent conference success rate.
As the Bears enter the later stages of their season, they seek to maximize offensive output at even strength.
“We’ve just got to score more goals 5-on-5,” Mehr said. “We can really contend with the top teams in the country moving forward here as we head towards playoffs.”
The Bears will host the University of Connecticut at Meehan Auditorium Saturday before resuming ECAC play against Princeton Feb. 9.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Anchored by clutch performances from its first-years, the gymnastics team finished just shy of second place at a quad meet hosted by Springfield College. Bruno posted a 190.600 to beat the Pride but fell short of overtaking Brockport State and first-place Southern Connecticut State University.</p>
<p class="p2">“It was our first quad meet, so it was a lot of energy and it was really loud,” said Emma Hansen ’21. “It was way different from the first two meets because there was just so much more going on, but I think we handled the pressure and the excitement really well.”</p>
<p class="p2">Injuries plagued the Bears’ lineups this week, but both rookies and returners stepped up to fill absences on all four events.</p>
<p class="p2">“We knew going into it that we had kind of a short lineup on each event because we had so many girls on the side, but overall it was a really great meet for learning,” said Anya Barca-Hall ’18. “A lot of girls who weren’t necessarily 100 percent ready to go had to step up for their team members who were out.”</p>
<p class="p2">Rose Domonoske ’21 kicked off the competition by leading Brown on floor exercise. Though still recovering from an ankle injury, she earned a 9.150 for her first collegiate floor routine. Hansen built on Domonoske’s score, adding a 9.700 to the team total. After sitting out the 2017 season with an injury, Barca-Hall returned to the floor lineup last week against the University of Bridgeport and wrapped up the first rotation at Springfield with a career-high 9.675.</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno’s second rotation marked the first collegiate vault by Diana Manzano ’20 since recovering from an injury that kept her out of the 2017 season. Manzano recorded a 9.500, and Anne Christman ’20 followed with a 9.525 to claim second place on the event.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears also proved their strength and showed off some depth on the uneven bars as three first-years hit big routines under pressure. After co-captain Claire Ryan ’18 placed second with 9.675, Caroline Warren ’21 kept the momentum swinging by earning a 9.625. Hansen ensured Bruno finished the third rotation with a bang by posting a 9.750 and winning her second bars title of the season.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown closed out the meet on what most consider the most nerve-wracking event: the balance beam.</p>
<p class="p2">“Right before we started beam, our coach just said to take a breath, calm ourselves and then just attack the event,” Barca-Hall said. “That’s something we’ve been working on — trying to be more present during competitions and not let nerves get to us especially when we end on beam.”</p>
<p class="p2">Ryan started the rotation with a 9.650 to give Bruno a solid start. Domonoske tallied a personal-best 9.600 and beam specialist Regan Butchness ’18 scored a 9.725 to finish in second on the apparatus and end Bruno’s competition.</p>
<p class="p2">The gymnastics team will be back in action Sunday for its annual Beauty and the Beast meet with the wrestling team.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’re really excited for our first home meet,” Hansen said. “We’re excited to get back out there and hopefully get a couple people back in the lineups, but even if we keep the lineups from this weekend we’ll still have a really strong set.”</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno will host Bridgeport and Rhode Island College in the Pizzitola Sports Center Sunday at noon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brownsword &#039;18: Sorry Cleveland (Again)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For LeBron James, the self-proclaimed King, success on the basketball court has become the expectation. The statistics speak for themselves: He’s been to seven straight NBA Finals, eight total, accounting for four MVPs and three Finals MVPs along the way. When James ends his career, his legacy will fall short only to that of the greatest basketball player of all-time, Michael Jordan. James’ talent is otherworldly and his greatness is obvious — even from the perspective of a rival Celtics fan.</p>
<p class="p2">All that being said: James should apologize to the city of Cleveland.</p>
<p class="p2">The kid from Akron, Ohio already incurred the ire of jersey-burning Cavalier fans when he left Cleveland to play with his friends in Miami. Leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers to join superstars Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade was undoubtedly the correct move to maximize his championship efforts, but broadcasting “The Decision” in front of millions of fans was an incredible misstep — as was his personal parade where he promised more than seven championships as a member of the Heat.</p>
<p class="p2">Cleveland fans and owner Dan Gilbert — after denouncing James publicly — got on their hands and knees, begging him to come back after his four years with the Heat yielded a 2-2 finals record. With Wade and Bosh declining and James somehow still ascending, James joined a Cavalier team with the number one overall pick and Kyrie Irving — one of the best young point guards in basketball.</p>
<p class="p2">And when the city of Cleveland won its first major sports championship in 52 years — thanks to a clutch Irving three-pointer in the final moments of Game 7 — James was again their hero, this time cementing his legendary status in Ohio.</p>
<p class="p2">Oh, how the Cavaliers have fallen from there. Cleveland is currently the three-seed in the Eastern Conference and is still the favorite to reach the finals, but the team is nowhere close to where it was two years ago. Irving — after not-so-subtly pronouncing his displeasure with James as a teammate and demanding a trade — is now on the rival Celtics, the number one seed. Tristan Thompson — whose rebounding single-handedly destroyed last-year’s Celtics team — is averaging just 5.2 points and 5.9 rebounds a game. And Irving’s replacement, 5-foot 9-inch Isaiah Thomas, is only hindering<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>what has been the league’s second-worst defense (<a href="https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1">according to defensive efficiency rating)</a>. James brought in his friends Wade and Derrick Rose, whose contributions to the Cavaliers have been exceedingly minimal — and defensively detrimental. James himself is in the bottom half of the league in defensive rating, while five Celtics regulars crack the <a href="https://stats.nba.com/players/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=MIN*GE*15">top 15</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">But it’s not just on the court where the Cavaliers are losing. Irving’s saga with James has been well-documented, and his trade to the Celtics only fueled Cleveland’s most direct competition. After Gilbert correctly<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>labelled “The Decision” a “narcissistic, self-promotional build-up” culminating in “shocking lack of disloyalty,” James has continually butted heads with the owner of his own team. One such instance was James’ insistence that Thompson be re-signed in 2015, which has resulted in one of the Cavaliers’ worst performers to be its second-highest paid player for the next three years.</p>
<p class="p2">A recent loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder — in which the Cavaliers gave up 148 points — sparked a players-only meeting which forced Kevin Love to defend the illness that forced him out of the game and practice the next day. James has routinely blamed Love during his time in Cleveland, even going so far as to subtweet him.</p>
<p class="p2">And in the midst of all that, James — after cleverly signing multiple short-term contracts with the Cavaliers — will become a free agent this summer, and early reports indicate that it is unlikely he will sign again with the Ohio team. But this time, it may lead to a mass exodus: Thomas’ contract is up in 2018 and JR Smith’s, Love’s and Thompson’s deals end in 2020. James’ 2017 complaint that the Cavaliers were not spending enough after their title win has created a situation in which the Cavaliers are on the hook for expensive expiring contracts even after James’ possible departure.</p>
<p class="p2">It may be argued that the Cavaliers are still in title contention, but losing two of their best three<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>players next summer will decimate those chances for 2019. What is already a historically bad James-led team defense will be horrific, and Love — who has been the third fiddle for most of his time in Cleveland — will be charged with leading the offense. Not only that, but James’ current success will leave the Cavaliers a terrible draft pick that will make them unable to bet on a quick turnaround from the league’s basement like they were able to do after miraculously getting the first pick to snag Irving in 2011. It’s no wonder Dan Gilbert is reportedly looking to sell the team.</p>
<p class="p2">James may have finally brought a championship to Cleveland, but his public comments and unquestionable weight in the team’s decision-making has made the future of the Cavaliers after this season as bleak as it was the first time he left. The team has 16 days before the trade deadline to fix its roster for a championship run, which would likely be the only thing to convince James to stay in Cleveland. But that won’t happen, and James will likely take his talents to Venice Beach to soak up his final NBA moments in the sun on an actually successful franchise.</p>
<p class="p2">The obvious counterargument is that a perennially losing city like Cleveland would never have won a title without James coming back. But one has to wonder whether he could have built a dynasty if he had stayed in the first place — like all the other supposed “GOATs” of sports (Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, Lionel Messi, Mariano Rivera etc.).</p>
<p class="p2">And it now may be a century before the city of Cleveland wins a title again — because if any team will be further away from a championship than the Cavaliers after James deserts them in 2018, it’s the Browns.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The women’s basketball team (13-4, 1-3 Ivy) opened conference play against Yale (9-8, 2-2) Jan. 12, beginning a two-month stretch that has them facing off against every Ivy League team twice in hopes of qualifying for the Ivy League tournament. The Bears got off to a weak start, collecting one win and one loss versus the Bulldogs before dropping two straight to Dartmouth (10-7, 2-2) and Harvard (11-6, 3-1).</p>
<p class="p4">The first contest against Yale was a decisive defeat with a final score of 63-77 in favor of the Bulldogs. Bruno erased a six point halftime deficit, tying the game with just under seven minutes left, but failed to contain an offensive surge from Yale that would help them pull away and win. The Bulldogs finished with a 19-5 scoring run to finish the game, ultimately tallying 25 points in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="p4">Yale took advantage of Brown’s blunders, scoring 17 points off of its 18 turnovers, while the Bears scored just six points from Yale’s 10 turnovers.</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno relied heavily on its starters for scoring purposes, earning zero points from the bench. Forward Erika Steeves ’19 led the way for Brown, notching 18 points and 11 rebounds, while guards Justine Gaziano ’20 and Shayna Mehta ’19 added 13 and 12 points apiece.</p>
<p class="p4">“We have quite a few players that can put up points very quickly. Unlike many of the other Ivy teams, we play at a fast pace, and our 80.6 scoring average is top in the league,” Mehta said.</p>
<p class="p4">Seven days later, the team looked to avenge its defeat, taking on Yale at home. The Bears were successful, besting the Bulldogs 81-71 in an exciting overtime decision. Brown held the lead for nearly the entire game, but its defense faltered in the fourth quarter, giving up 25 points to Yale and allowing them to tie the game at 65 and send it into overtime.</p>
<p class="p4">The team’s rebounding prowess and a fast-paced offense worked to its advantage, allowing Bruno to collect 57 rebounds and tally 14 fast break points. Forward Janie White ’19 added 12 rebounds and 17 points, while Steeves grabbed 11 boards. White and Steeves have led their team in rebounding this season, averaging 7.5 and 8.8 rebounds per game, respectively.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown pulled away in overtime, outscoring the Bulldogs 15-5 to cinch the victory. Scoring off the bench made a difference in the contest this time, as the Bears tallied 24 points in the win. Gaziano led the team with 20 points.</span></p>
<p class="p4">The team looked to continue its winning ways, traveling to Dartmouth Jan. 26, but came up short 78-73. The close game was highlighted by Mehta’s 25-point scoring performance, which sent her to 12th place on the team’s all-time scoring list.</p>
<p class="p4">Once again, the Bears were hard-pressed to finish the game strong, giving up 45 to the Big Green in the second half and squandering a five-point halftime lead.</p>
<p class="p4">“We need to improve by playing a full 40 minutes of Brown basketball,” Mehta said.</p>
<p class="p4">Dartmouth had an efficient shooting night, converting on 30 of its 62 attempts. While both teams shot the same number of free throws, the Big Green was a perfect seven for seven from the line, while Bruno struggled, going just four for seven. This alone gave Dartmouth a three-point advantage in a game that was decided by just five points.</p>
<p class="p4">Gaziano was a reliable scorer once again, putting up 18 points. Steeves’ 16 points, seven rebounds and three blocks highlighted her well-rounded game.</p>
<p class="p4">The team attempted to bounce back from its loss the next day, playing Harvard at home, but added another close defeat 87-85. There were 10 ties and eight lead changes throughout the game, which came down to the wire. Guard Dominique Leonidas ’21 scored a layup with just 34 seconds left to play to bring the Bears within one, but they were unable to close, missing a game-tying layup as the buzzer sounded.</p>
<p class="p4">“Our team needs to prioritize the next possession philosophy, both on offense and defense, by being grittier and by working harder for each possession than the other team,” Mehta said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Bruno showed its shooting strength, making 33 of 62 field goal attempts. Guards Gaziano and Mehta put on a scoring display. Gaziano was particularly efficient, scoring a season high 28 points on nine of 13 shooting, with four three-pointers made on six attempts. Mehta added 25 points, seven rebounds, three assists and three steals. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Ultimately, the Crimson was able to find the upper hand through rebounding and bench scoring. Harvard collected 40 rebounds versus Brown’s 31, and scored 24 points from the bench, while the Bears once again struggled off the bench with just nine points.</p>
<p class="p4">The team will continue Ivy play Friday, Feb. 2, hosting Penn at 6 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">After jumping to an early lead, the men’s basketball team held on to hand Dartmouth its third Ivy League loss of the season Friday night. Though the Bears (9-8, 2-2 Ivy) maintained the advantage for all 40 minutes, a play made by Zach Hunsaker ’20 at the buzzer stole the show. With seven seconds left, Dartmouth hit a free throw that looked to send the game to overtime. But Hunsaker weaved through the Big Green’s (4-13, 0-4) defense to score the game-winning layup as the clock hit zero.</p>
<p class="p4">Hunsaker also tallied five rebounds, 12 points and led the Bears with three assists. His efforts earned him Brown Athletics Student-Athlete of the Week Honors and the number three spot on SportsCenter’s Top 10 Plays.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For his clutch performance and unforgettable shot, Hunsaker has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the win! What were you thinking as the final seconds ticked off the clock? </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hunsaker: I was pretty nervous when the (Dartmouth) kid had two free throws and put one up at the end of the game, but I knew that we were fine and that we were going to have a chance to win the game. I just tried to keep calm and, luckily, the ball came to me at the end. That was definitely a special moment. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What was going through your head when you made the shot?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I thought I got fouled at the end, to be honest. I thought I had a good shot at it, but I didn’t really see it go in because I got hit. I fell down, so I didn’t really see it until it was coming through the hoop. It was definitely a relief. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Did you know that the highlight made it on SportsCenter? </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I actually got a text from a coach that had recruited me to go to a different school last year. He texted me and said it was on ESPN, and I was super surprised. I had no idea it was going to be on there. I was hoping one day to make it on ESPN. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How did you first get into basketball?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I’ve been playing basketball for as long as I can remember. My dad was a college basketball coach. It’s always been a major part of my life, especially because of my dad and that being his job. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How do you prepare for games? </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I just make sure I go and get some shots up before the game. I always take a nap about three hours before the game to relax. I listen to music, but usually it’s Post Malone or something like that. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Why Brown? </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I went to junior college last year, so it’s kind of crazy to go from a junior college to an Ivy League school. Before I went to junior college, I lived in Africa for two years as a missionary for my church right after I graduated from high school. Before I did that, I was talking to Dartmouth about going and playing basketball there, and so when I got back from being a missionary, I had talked to them as well. But the funny thing is Dartmouth actually told me that they didn’t really want me to come play for them, so that’s why I went to a junior college. It’s kind of crazy how the game-winner happened to be against Dartmouth, so that was great. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>What did that win do for the team’s attitude and mentality?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was a definitely a confidence booster for us. Any time you win a game in the Ivy League, it’s always great. It just kind of helped us to get going, and hopefully, we can continue to win some more games. Obviously, losing to Harvard on Saturday didn’t really help too much, but hopefully, we can turn it around this weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>How is the team feeling about the rest of the schedule? </b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We know it’s going to be difficult, but we feel pretty confident that we can play with any of the teams. If we can just continue to get better each and every day, hopefully, we’ll be able to put ourselves in a good position at the end of the season. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Does the team have any specific goals for the rest of the season?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I wouldn’t say we have any specific goals. We’re just trying to take it one game at a time, and obviously, we want to get to the Ivy League tournament. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears begin their next pair of Ivy games by facing off against Penn tonight at 7 p.m. and will travel to Princeton for a 6 p.m. tip-off Saturday. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The entire country expects the New England Patriots to win Sunday’s Super Bowl against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Vegas line opened with the Patriots as 5.5 point favorites, seven out of eight Sporting News analysts predicted a Pats victory and even the official Madden simulation went New England’s way. It makes sense — how could the Patriots not be Super Bowl champions once again? With quarterback Tom Brady facing Nick Foles as his opposition, it is hard at first glance to deduce that the Eagles are anything but outmatched. After all, Foles may have been terrific two weeks ago against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship Game, but he is the same player who threw 20 touchdowns over his last two NFL seasons as a starter — 12 fewer than Brady threw in this year alone.</p>
<p class="p2">Nevertheless, even though Foles is a wildcard at best and a disaster at worst, the Eagles have a solid chance at winning a championship because of their strengths at every other position. The defense is this team’s calling card, but Philadelphia has a strong offense too — their running backs and receivers are notably impressive.</p>
<p class="p2">Looking at the defense first, it is evident that the Eagles have an advantage over New England on paper. The Pats allowed 366 yards per game this season, fourth worst in the league. The Eagles, on the other hand, surrendered just 306 ypg — fourth-best. Philadelphia secured 19 interceptions to New England’s 12 and scored five defensive touchdowns to New England’s zero. Defensive ends Chris Long and Brandon Graham have been nothing short of dominant up front — star talents above what New England brings to the table.</p>
<p class="p2">Yet in the end, the Eagles are still up against Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski (who will be back for the Super Bowl after suffering a concussion). Two weeks ago, with an injured hand and facing the AFC’s best defense, Brady torched the Jacksonville Jaguars for 290 yards and two touchdowns, looking his strongest in the fourth quarter. Philadelphia may have an impressive defense, but can Brady be stopped when it matters most? The Eagles held Matt Ryan to 210 yards and a touchdown in the Divisional Round — and even though Brady is by far the superior QB, if Philadelphia can keep him remotely in check, they will have a fair shot at Super Bowl victory.</p>
<p class="p2">How would the Eagles win with Foles at quarterback? On the strength of their running game, which sets up Foles for success beyond what his talent would signal. Jay Ajayi and LeGarrette Blount each provide different skillsets that complement each other perfectly. Ajayi is elusive and slippery — he glides through holes and is difficult to catch. He averaged 5.8 yards per running attempt with the Eagles this season. Blount, on the other hand, is simply hard to bring down. Standing at six feet, 250 pounds, Blount can run through defenders and makes for an ideal third-down and goal line back. He has a touchdown in each of Philadelphia’s two playoff games. It is almost impossible to hold Blount to less than a yard in these important situations — the momentum and force he creates is overpowering.</p>
<p class="p2">Then, once the running game starts gaining chunks of yardage, the Eagles can allow Foles to chuck up deep balls and catch the defense off-guard. The Vikings loaded up against the run and underneath passes, and so were wholly unprepared to defend throws downfield to Alshon Jeffrey and Torrey Smith. Foles has a tendency to overthink during games and grow hesitant and unsure of himself, which has resulted in a lot of struggle. But when he takes a long shot downfield without having to think, he can place the ball in the perfect spot.</p>
<p class="p2">Helping Foles will be Philly’s strong group of receivers. The Eagles spread out targets throughout this group. No one receiver is the focus of the offense, but everyone is involved in the game plan. Tight end Zach Ertz will see a bunch of passes up the middle — he has dependable hands and has been a mainstay in Philly over the past few seasons. Jeffrey has settled into a complementary role after his time spent starring for the Chicago Bears. Nelson Agholor is one of this season’s biggest surprises, more than doubling his receiving yards total from last year. Smith is way past his prime, but he can still make important, game-changing plays — he is someone used to big moments.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All this is not to say that the Eagles will definitely win the Super Bowl. That would be a foolish statement considering New England’s track record. But the Eagles, once again, are underrated. Even with Carson Wentz out, they are still the best team in the NFC, and have the potential to overpower any team. The Eagles were underdogs at home against the Falcons. Then again against the Vikings. Now they are significant underdogs in the Super Bowl. It should not be a surprise if they overcome the odds one more time. New England is better, but Pats fans would be best advised not to be cocky heading into Sunday. They could be setting themselves up for a massive Monday disappointment.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">A column written by a Patriots fan before the weekend of the team’s eighth Super Bowl appearance in the past two decades will seem quite unnecessary. I struggle to imagine what straw arguments Patriots doubters could be desperately grasping for, with Tom Brady skipping the Pro Bowl for the third time in four years.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But for all that you’ve likely heard about the quarterbacking greatness of Brady — his social media presence tells you enough — and the football genius of Bill Belichick, there’s more to the story of the Patriots. Year after year, the entire NFL is seemingly upended, with new challengers arising and contenders falling from grace. While the NFC has sent 12 different teams to the Super Bowl since 2001, New England has been to the AFC championship as many times in that period. That’s a stat that goes beyond Brady, Belichick and owner Robert Kraft, the three mainstays of the organization. For the countless Patriots detractors that will point to “cheating” as a foundation for the team’s success, here are the real reasons New England continues to win, year after year.</span></p>
<p class="p3">First of all: Tom Brady. I know, I said I would discuss not-so-obvious reasons; however, this has nothing to do with Brady’s exceptional quarterbacking. It’s his contract: Brady is the 15th highest-paid quarterback in the league, earning slightly more than below-par counterparts Ryan Tannehill, Brock Osweiler and Sam Bradford. Beyond his continuous MVP-caliber production is the fact that he allows the Patriots to spend so much money elsewhere while every other NFL team scrambles to pay significantly more just to secure average QBs.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Last year’s Super Bowl matchup was a contest between the 15th and 14th highest-paid QBs, and this year’s opponents, the Eagles, are still reaping the benefits of Carson Wentz’ paltry rookie contract. Getting good quarterback play for cheap in the NFL is borderline impossible, and Brady could easily force the Patriots to pay more for him. But his goals include the team’s success, so he is able to take a pay cut and allow the Patriots to spend more money on weapons on both sides of the ball.</span></p>
<p class="p3">The Patriots’ salary construction brings me to my second point: Bill Belichick is a genius. Again, this is not old news; but it’s Bill Belichick the general manager, not the coach, that is instrumental in New England’s perpetual greatness. He’s traded for one-year contracts like that of Brandin Cooks — whose $1.56 million cap hit makes him the fifth highest-paid wide receiver on the team — and Kyle Van Noy, two players who have been crucial to the team’s success this year. Players like Cooks, Malcolm Brown and Malcolm Butler are all on contracts that are <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/new-england-patriots/positional/2017/full-cap/">valued</a> around $10 million fewer per year than estimated market value.</p>
<p class="p3">The cost of Belichick’s entire defensive line — built entirely through the draft and via free-agent signings — is 29th in the NFL, but the Patriots accrued the seventh-most sacks in the league this year. The money spent on the offense represents the 11th most in the NFL, but the Patriots were top-two in passing yards and top-10 in rushing. Competitors to the Patriots include teams like the Steelers, which spend top dollar on offense and relatively little on defense, and the Jaguars, which do the opposite. But Belichick’s offensive and defensive spending are usually very even — especially in the years that the Patriots win the Super Bowl.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Belichick saves all the money for special teams — on which the Patriots spend the fourth-most in the league. Though the Patriots punt the least in the league, New England is one of the better teams at downing punts inside the 20-yard line and limiting return yardage. Stephen Gostkowski has been a rock-solid kicker for several years. Pro Bowler and future Hall-of-Famer special teamer Matthew Slater makes more than a 1,000-yard wide receiver in Cooks. Belichick knows that playing all three facets of the game well is key, and the performance of New England combined with its well-balanced salary construction is conducive to long-term success.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And, lastly, someone who gets relatively zero credit for the Patriots’ impressive record is offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia. Scarnecchia, who was hired by Belichick in 2000, is a former assistant head coach for the Patriots. His presence was never more obvious than when he retired in 2014, and the line play of the Patriots suffered miserably. 2014 was the year that the Patriots started 2-2 after getting steamrolled by the Chiefs, and Scarnecchia shortly returned to host workouts with players before returning to the sideline in 2016. His offensive line in 2016 gave up the third-least sacks in the NFL, and 2017’s version — even with an injury to right tackle Marcus Cannon — is performing in the top half of the NFL. Any doubts left with Tom Brady likely revolve around his inability to deal with constant pressure, and Scarnecchia’s offensive lines have allowed a 40-year-old quarterback to play the best years of his career.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Infamous as the secret, evil dictators of the NFL, Bill Belichick, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots have executed the simplest of blueprints for NFL success: Buy low, increase performance, sell high. In between those market simplicities are the true football genius of Brady and Belichick, but the team’s approach to building a championship-caliber roster — year after year — is decipherable, if any NFL GM is truly paying attention. Implementing it has been another story, however.</p>
<p class="p3">Despite that, it’s no secret that proximity to the Patriots dynasty has made former coaches and players extremely valuable across the NFL, as three former coordinators and a former linebacker will coach four different teams in the league next year. Whether you like it or not, your favorite team would give up anything for the chance to have any small part of New England’s success come its way. Sooner or later, it might just be 31 Belichick disciples and a 100-year-old, immortal Bill Belichick competing for the Belichick Cup.</p>
<p class="p3">My money would still be on the Patriots.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Tensions mounted Friday as the women’s tennis team persevered through multiple tie-breaks and close doubles matches to defeat the University of Massachusetts at Amherst 5-2. The competition brought a familiar face — the current UMass (2-2) head coach Juancarlos “JC” Nunez, a former Brown assistant — back to the Pizzitola Center courts.</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno (2-2) kept its cool and came away with the victory.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“During practice we really focused on preparing intensely, really making sure that we were ready to compete hard and leave all of the emotional components to the side,” said Juliana Simon ’20.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The Bears demonstrated that laser focus during the opening matches as second and third doubles came from behind to put Brown up 1-0. After Head Coach Paul Wardlaw made changes to the lineup last week, Alyza Benotto ’18 and Semi Oloko ’21 worked together to pull off a 6-4 win while Maddie Stearns ’18 and Taylor Cosme ’19 claimed the doubles point with a 6-4 victory.</p>
<p class="p2">“Everyone was super positive,” Cosme said. “In the doubles play, the energy was amazing because we knew we could win the doubles point. That really set a precedent for how everyone was going to play singles.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Bruno carried that optimistic energy into its individual matches. Cosme put the Bears up 2-0 after a 6-3, 6-2 win in fourth singles, but the Minutewomen notched a victory in second singles to cut Brown’s advantage to one point. </span></p>
<p class="p2">A clutch 7-5, 6-2 victory by Stearns in first singles swung the momentum back in Bruno’s favor as Simon then clinched the overall match with a fifth singles win, and Courtney Kowalsky ’21 added another point by downing her opponent in the sixth spot to hit the 5-2 final score.</p>
<p class="p2">“Our engagement as a team has really improved,” Simon said. “Everyone on the team is super engaged and cheering for all the matches, which really translates onto the court. Once everyone is riled up, it really makes a huge difference for team morale and how we compete in general.”</p>
<p class="p2">The victory over the Minutewomen puts the Bears in prime position as they prepare for the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championship Feb. 9.</p>
<p class="p2">“It was a good match for us at the start of our season to prepare us for what’s to come, especially since we have the ECAC tournament coming up next weekend,” Simon said.</p>
<p class="p2">Cosme credited the team’s success and effective preparation to Wardlaw and the addition of first-year assistant coach Lucie Schmidhauser. After the ECAC tournament, the Bears will turn their attention to Ivy League opponents.</p>
<p class="p2">“All across the board, we’re consistently just playing smarter points and really competing well,” Simon said. “We’ve done a good job of raising our intensity, focusing from point to point and really fighting for every point.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The women’s basketball team (13-6, 1-5 Ivy) continued Ivy League play this weekend, hosting Penn (13-5, 4-1) Friday and Princeton (14-4, 4-1) Saturday. Bruno failed to collect a conference win over the two-day stretch, losing both games.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Penn controlled the first matchup from the tip-off, and that was the story until the game ended 88-55, marking the Bears’ biggest loss of the season. Brown’s offense, usually high-energy, was uncharacteristically muted. Reliable scorers Shayna Mehta ’19 and Justine Gaziano ’20 were the only two players on the team to score double digits, posting 17 and 13 points apiece. Each added five rebounds. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a whole, the team had a difficult shooting night, making just 21 of 66 total field goal attempts. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Head Coach Sarah Behn saw the biggest difference in her team’s defense. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re not getting as many stops as we need to at the other end,” Behn said. Utilizing fast-paced ball movement that often led to open looks from all over the floor, the Quakers were tough to stop on offense. They converted on 13 of 35 three-point attempts and scored 38 points in the paint. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The next day, the Bears were unable to bounce back, losing to Princeton 77-62.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“They worked hard today. I was much more pleased with their physical effort today versus yesterday,” Behn said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Tigers’ lead, which was 25 at its largest, was cut down to 15 by the end of the game, partly thanks to forward Janie White ’18. The physical matchup gave White an opportunity to show her skills in the post. Tallying 15 points, 15 rebounds and three blocks, she proved again why she is an impact player for Brown. Mehta added 17 points. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I was really pleased with Janie White inside today,” Behn said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a whole, the Bears were out of sync, missing pass attempts and struggling to finish at the rim. Once again, their shooting performance was below average, going 23 for 59 overall. The Tigers clogged passing lanes, recording 17 points off of Bruno’s 17 turnovers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Just a few weeks prior to the start of Ivy League play, Brown lost guard Taylor Will ’19 to a season-ending injury. With Will out, Coach Behn has been calling on her second unit to fill the gap, giving various bench players a starting spot in an attempt to find the lineup that will give her team the most success. Still, she acknowledges the impact Will’s injury has had on the team. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It has been a pretty monumental hit to take. We’re just still trying to find our way,” Behn said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Later next week, Brown will travel to New York to take on two more Ivy League foes, playing at Cornell Friday Jan. 9 and at Columbia Saturday Jan. 10.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re just going game by game and trying to get better. We’re on a little skid right here, but this conference is really hard and hopefully we can get it together next week and get some wins on the road,” Behn said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The men’s basketball team played two games that went down to the wire in overtime this weekend. Bruno fell to Penn Friday and was carried by the heroics of Desmond Cambridge ’21 to a victory against Princeton Saturday.</p>
<p class="p4">With the results, the Bears (10-9, 3-3 Ivy) remain in fourth place in the Ivy League, trailing Penn, Harvard and Princeton in the conference standings.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Penn 95, Brown 90 (OT)</b></p>
<p class="p4">The Bears fell in heartbreaking fashion against the Quakers in overtime. Missed free throws doomed Bruno in the 95-90 loss.</p>
<p class="p4">“Something about going into another team’s gym and playing really brings out the competitor in you,” said Travis Fuller ’21. “We played well. (We) just didn’t have some things go our way in the end.”</p>
<p class="p4">The game began as a back-and-forth duel, with five lead changes in the first half. Cambridge led Brown with 13 points on 6-9 shooting, followed by Zach Hunsaker ’20, who posted 11. The Bears shot 53 percent from the field along with 56 percent from beyond the three point arc. At the half, Bruno led the Quakers (15-6, 5-0) 43-42.</p>
<p class="p4">The intensity continued to heighten in the second period, as a layup from Matt DeWolf ’21 gave Brown a 71-70 lead with eight minutes remaining. Moments later, Brandon Anderson ’20 completed a spinning layup to finish a tough shot in traffic and extend the lead to four.</p>
<p class="p4">With five minutes left, Cambridge launched a three-point bomb to give the Bears a 79-75 lead. He would finish with 29 points on 12-19 shooting.</p>
<p class="p4">“Dez (Desmond) has been a big part of our success this year,” Fuller said. “I know he’ll continue to (play well) in the future.”</p>
<p class="p4">But with 1:48 left in the game, Darnell Foreman made two free throws from the charity stripe to trim Brown’s lead to just two. Thirty seconds later, two more free throws from Foreman tied the game at 82.</p>
<p class="p4">In overtime, Brown kept the game close, but Max Rothschild’s hook shot over Bruno’s defenders put Penn on top by two with 30 seconds left.</p>
<p class="p4">Cambridge was fouled with 15 seconds remaining, but missed both shots at the free-throw line. With five seconds left in the game, Brown still had a chance to force a second overtime with a trey. Hunsaker could not connect on the long shot, and Penn went on to win 95-90.</p>
<p class="p4">Anderson chipped in with 18 points along with Hunsaker, who notched 14. Bruno shot 49 percent from the field and scored 36 points in the paint.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Brown 102, Princeton 100 (OT)</b></p>
<p class="p4">Entering Saturday’s contest, Brown had only won three times on the road against Princeton in program history. But an offensive surge led by Cambridge was enough to silence the Tigers and their 19-game home winning streak.</p>
<p class="p4">The first half once again foreshadowed a close game for the Bears, as the period featured six lead changes. Cambridge was a highlight again, notching 19 points in the first frame.</p>
<p class="p4">At halftime, the Bears and the Tigers (11-9, 3-2) were tied at 49, as Brown shot 57 percent from the field and Princeton shot 56 percent. Both squads were scorching hot from beyond the arc, as Bruno shot 62 percent to Princeton’s 73 percent.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With four minutes left to play in the second, Devin Cannady hit a three-pointer to extend Princeton’s lead to seven — the Tigers’ largest lead of the day. But merely seconds later, Hunsaker responded with a three of his own to narrow the Princeton advantage to four. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Anderson came in clutch with a layup with just a minute left in the game. The shot put the score at 87-85, bringing Bruno within two points of the Tigers. Just 24 seconds later, Cannady made a jump shot to make it a two score game.</p>
<p class="p4">But Cambridge hit an extremely well-defended three-pointer to bring Brown back within one mark of the Tigers. After Princeton missed a free throw, Cambridge was fouled with five seconds left and made both free throws to tie the game at 90.</p>
<p class="p4">Two seconds later, Princeton had the ball in a tied game with a chance for victory, but Cambridge’s heroics were not over. Myles Stephens got the ball at the top of the key and drove inside for a possible game-winning layup, but Cambridge blocked the shot and sent the Bears into their second overtime game of the weekend.</p>
<p class="p4">In overtime, neither the Tigers nor the Bears could get an edge. With 58 seconds left, Obi Okolie ’19 grabbed his own rebound and launched a layup to give Brown a two-point lead. But 14 seconds later, a shot by Sebastian Much tied the game at 98.</p>
<p class="p4">Then, Stephenson worked his way inside and earned the foul with 15 seconds remaining. He made both free throws to give Princeton a two-point lead.</p>
<p class="p4">Then Cambridge launched a seemingly impossible three-point shot from the top right corner of the arc to give Brown a one-point lead with four seconds remaining. The arcing shot silenced the Princeton crowd and sent the Bears’ bench jumping for joy. Princeton could not get off another shot, and Brown went on to win 102-100.</p>
<p class="p4">“(The play) didn’t work exactly how I wanted it to,” Cambridge said. “But I was supposed to shoot it, and it went in. I’ve been feeling it all night, the best (feeling) I’ve ever had.”</p>
<p class="p4">Cambridge finished the game with 32 points followed by Anderson with 25 points. Brown shot 58 percent from the field and a sterling 62 percent from beyond the arc.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s been a long time since we won here,” Cambridge said. “I really wanted this one, and it just feels so great.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears will return to the Pizzitola Center to host Cornell Friday and Columbia Saturday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Following mixed results on the road last weekend, the men’s hockey team was slighted by the University of Connecticut 6-4 in a close contest at Meehan Auditorium Saturday.</p>
<p class="p2">Zach Giuttari ’20, Max Gottlieb ’19 and Tommy Marchin ’19 led the Bears’ offensive efforts in the loss. The Bears (6-13-4, 5-10-1 ECAC) went 2-for-5 on the power play, converting twice on a five-minute major in the first period.</p>
<p class="p2">The Huskies (13-16-2, 9-11-1 Hockey East) opened scoring midway through the first stanza, but Bruno answered a minute and a half later when Marchin sent a one-timer past UConn goaltender Tanner Creel on the power play. Sam Lafferty ’18 sent a pass through the slot to Marchin, who was waiting at the right post to knock in the equalizer.</p>
<p class="p2">UConn posted a shorthanded goal on the same penalty two minutes later, before Gottlieb evened the tally again on the power play. Gottlieb collected a pass from Giuttari and fired a shot top shelf from in front of the blue line to keep the Bears on the Huskies’ heels.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’ve been working on the power play a lot,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “(In) the last three games I think we’ve done a really good job in terms of getting pucks to the net, better puck movement, better support and making sure we’re intense on loose pucks.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Getting a power play at the beginning of the game is always good — it’s a good way to get momentum,” Giuttari said. “It was great that we scored two goals on it, but we also let up one shorthanded goal on it too, so it was kind of a give and take.”</p>
<p class="p2">UConn took advantage of a pair of Brown penalties later in the first period, converting on a 5-on-3 power play to send the Bears into the locker room at a one-goal deficit.</p>
<p class="p2">The game continued to go back and forth as Giuttari capitalized on a turnover and launched a shot past Creel to level the score nine minutes into the second frame. Tyler Bird ’18 answered another UConn goal early in the final period, tapping in a shot taken by Gottlieb from the point.</p>
<p class="p2">The Huskies scored on a power play midway through the stanza before adding an empty net goal in the final minute when Brown pulled goaltender Luke Kania ’21 for an extra skater.</p>
<p class="p2">Kania made 28 saves as the Bears were outshot by UConn 34-31.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown’s penalty kill went 3-for-5, conceding two goals to the Huskies’ power play. The team’s overall success rate on the kill sits at 80 percent.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’ve got to do a better job of clears (on the penalty kill) … knowing when to be aggressive versus when to be passive,” Whittet said. “Sometimes we’re so passive that we give them the wrong time in the zone and that’s ultimately going to lead to our guys getting tired, and major opportunities for the opposition’s power play.”</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno is currently seated in tenth place in the ECAC standings and hopes to gain home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs, which begin March 2. Home ice is granted to the higher seed in each pair of teams. In preparation, Whittet stressed the importance of maintaining intensity and focus in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="p2">“We have to find a way to come out and play really intense, basically playoff, hockey,” Whittet said. “We want to be at home in the first round and I think it’s a realistic goal. I think it’s a goal that our guys should be striving for.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears also look to increase their time in the offensive zone and relieve pressure on their defense.</p>
<p class="p2">“We have to work on our breakouts — we had a tough time breaking the puck out today,” Giuttari said. “The more we break it out and the more we play in the offensive zone,” it becomes “easier on our team, our goalie and our defense.”</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno remains poised and maintains a day-by-day approach in the lead-up to its final six games of the regular season, four of which will be played at home.</p>
<p class="p2">“Every game’s important,” Giuttari said. “We’re ready to take them on. Each game is its own individual battle, so we’ll play it by ear.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears will resume ECAC play this weekend, hosting Princeton Friday and Quinnipiac University Saturday at Meehan Auditorium.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brownsword &#039;18: Bears poised for Ivy postseason tournament</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Ivy League had long been resistant to change in the sport of men’s basketball: While nearly every other conference adopted the exhilarating postseason tournament, the Ancient Eight sent the team with the best league record to the NCAA tournament — until 2017.

Now, the NCAA’s oldest basketball league is one year into its annual four-team, postseason tournament, and 2018’s version will be held in Philadelphia just like last year. 2017’s tournament saw undefeated Princeton march on to the NCAA tournament after handily defeating Penn and Yale.

But this year’s competition for a coveted playoff spot in the Ancient Eight is much more compact, as the five teams sitting from third to seventh place are within one game of one another. And at the top of that list are the Brown Bears, who are 3-3 in conference play and have only qualified for the NCAA tournament twice — the last time in 1986.

This year’s squad, however, has all the signs of being an actual Cinderella story come March. With only one senior on the roster and three new starters, the team’s three leading scorers are two sophomores and a first-year. Second-year point guard Brandon Anderson ’20 is leading the team with 19 points and four assists. Zach Hunsaker ’20 — the buzzer-beating hero of two weekends ago — has stepped into the starting lineup and averages over 10 points a game.

But the story of this year’s team has to be the play of Desmond Cambridge ’21. The six-foot-four guard is leading the team in rebounds and blocks, all while averaging over 17 points and one assist a game. The leader of Brown’s interior defense is the team’s third-best three-point and second-best field goal shooter, and his assist-to-turnover ratio is tied for second on the team.

Still not enough to convince you? Cambridge had his coming-out party while touring Pennsylvania — hopefully in preparation for a return visit later — scoring 29 points against conference-undefeated Penn in an overtime loss and 32 in an overtime win against fourth-place Princeton. The first-year hit seven of nine threes against the Tigers, including the game-winning three in overtime.

Yes, without Cambridge’s and Hunsaker’s heroics, this team could easily be staring at a 1-5 conference record, doomed to play its last eight Ivy League games of the season for pride. And, in past years, this has been the case more often than not. In fact, in the last 10 years, Brown men’s basketball has only finished in fourth place or above twice. But, despite the youth of this year’s team, Bruno is in the poll position with just over half of the conference regular season still to play.

The Bears have four home games left, including two crucial tilts this weekend against against fifth-place Columbia and sixth-place Cornell. If Brown were to win both of these home games, it could extend its lead to one or two games for that final tournament spot. That would all but guarantee that the Bears’ final two home games of the season, against Penn and Princeton again, would feature Brown playing for its first-ever spot in the Ivy League postseason tournament. Hopefully, despite the Bears’ typically weak home support — especially from students — this year’s men’s basketball team can inspire some dedicated fans that may, one day, plan their March trip to the Palestra.

Rarely in my four years at Brown has a sports event drawn a large, loud crowd — the men’s lacrosse team’s NCAA quarterfinal appearance and the men’s hockey team’s 2-1 upset win over nationally ranked Harvard are two of the few examples. Hardly ever have large groups of student fans flocked to Bruno’s athletic facilities to see a meaningful regular season game, but these Brown Bears are competing in newfound territory. This team should give hope that even Brown — the least competitive athletic program in the Ivy League for the past 10 years — could make it to the big stage.

Go Bruno.

		<title>Klein &#039;20: After Super Bowl LII, who are next year’s favorites?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Super Bowl LII was a game that will be remembered for quite some time, not only because of the record yardage totals, but also for its surprising result: a 41-33 Philadelphia Eagles victory. Down five points, about to drive late in the fourth quarter, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots seemed certain to complete another championship-winning comeback. Yet defensive end Brandon Graham strip-sacked Brady, the Eagles kicked another field goal and the Pats failed to complete a last-second Hail Mary. The Eagles won the Super Bowl.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the sports world moves on quickly. The biggest current football story is not even about the Super Bowl, but rather Josh McDaniels ditching the Indianapolis head coaching job and returning to New England as the offensive coordinator. Teams are already looking ahead to next year, and even the champion Eagles have some important decisions to make. Nick Foles will be a subject of trade discussions all through the offseason, as every team without a solid quarterback will check on the availability of the Super Bowl MVP.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But with the 2017 NFL season in the rearview mirror, who should be the favorites heading into next year? The Eagles and Patriots are obviously contenders, but several other teams have a championship in their sights.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Philadelphia, first of all, could be even better next season, with star Carson Wentz coming back from his ACL injury. It is easy to forget just how dominating the second-year quarterback was, as Foles basks in the glow of playoff success. Last season, Wentz threw for 3,296 passing yards and 33 touchdowns, with only seven interceptions, in 13 games ­— one of the leading candidates for MVP. Philly will enter the 2018 season with only the highest of expectations. Anything short of another Super Bowl would be a disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">New England, meanwhile, enters the offseason with legitimate questions and concerns. The Patriots’ defense was exposed all game by the Eagles, with former hero Malcolm Butler benched by coach Bill Belichick. The full story has not been made public yet, but different rumors about the surprise move continue to circulate. Butler, a free agent, will almost certainly be gone. Matt Patricia, former New England defensive coordinator, is gone as well — he accepted the head-coaching position with the Detroit Lions. And though Pats fans have belittled Patricia and his coaching over the past couple of days, his absence will leave a void in the organization. He has been a member of New England’s coaching staff since 2004 and served as the defensive coordinator since 2012. All is not rosy in Foxborough.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moving on to the non-Super Bowl teams, the Jacksonville Jaguars will not improve their record by seven games again, but this organization is more than ready to compete. The tremendous defense, led by star cornerback Jalen Ramsey, will be back next season. So, too, will young running back Leonard Fournette. Change could come at the quarterback position, however. Though he was solid for stretches of last season and performed admirably against the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, Blake Bortles drew the ire of fans for missed throws and poor decision-making. The Jaguars have been tied to free agent Kirk Cousins, who threw for 27 touchdowns and 4,093 yards last season. With Cousins, a more dependable and consistent quarterback, the Jaguars would not have to rely so much on the defense to win games and would better hold their own offensively against the league’s best teams. Signing Cousins is the type of move that wins championships.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The New Orleans Saints, after three consecutive mediocre campaigns, were impressive, buoyed by the addition of rookie running back Alvin Kamara. Paired with Mark Ingram, Kamara’s catching ability out of the backfield makes for an unstoppable weapon. With an off-season for Kamara to develop further, the Saints are ready to challenge the Philadelphia Eagles for NFC dominance. After all, New Orleans was one magical, fluke play from facing those Eagles in the conference championship game. If quarterback Drew Brees can continue to stave off decline at age 39, the Saints will be one of the most dangerous teams in the league. With a veteran QB and explosive weapons all over the field, this is a group built for the playoffs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For a sleeper team that could shock the world like the Jags last season, look no further than the Los Angeles Chargers. While the Chargers did go 9-7 (rather than the Jacksonville’s 3-13 record in 2016), the team garnered little press or buzz and has become widely underrated. After a slow start, the Chargers surged to six wins in the season’s final seven weeks, and all the pieces are in place for a playoff run. Quarterback Philip Rivers has not lost a beat, running back Melvin Gordon is a workhorse and wide receiver Keenan Allen is one of the NFL’s best at his position. The defense is stifling as well, with defensive end Joey Bosa leading the way. Bosa has 23 sacks in two NFL campaigns. Watch out for the Chargers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prediction: Eagles over Jaguars.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Desmond Cambridge ’21 may be just a freshman, but his stand-out performances this season have earned the men’s basketball team three much-needed wins against Ivy League rivals. He scored a total of 62 points in two games this weekend, three of which came on a game-winning shot with just four seconds left in overtime against Princeton. Cambridge, a native of Nashville, Tennessee, has been named Ivy League Rookie of the Week six times and Ivy League Player of the Week twice. For his outstanding performance in Saturday’s contest, which snapped Princeton’s 19-game home winning streak, Cambridge has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the great win last weekend! Can you talk about the game-winning shot?</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Cambridge: We were down two, and coach set up a play for me to get the shot. (The team) knows all of our live plays ­— the plan was to call out the play so everyone syncs in and acts like I’m going to the basket, and I would fake it and come out for the three pointer. Then Brandon (Anderson ’20) would kick it out to me. As you can see, it didn’t really work out that way. The ball rolled out, but I was supposed to shoot it. So I was like what the heck, just go for it. Even though it was kind of a crazy shot, I actually practice those shots and it went in. It felt good. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>After losing a tough game to Penn the night before, how hard was it to come out and play well a day later?</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">It was definitely tough. (The Penn game) was heartbreaking because it was basically like the same situation (as the Princeton game). It turns out I was the one who actually missed the game-tying free throws and that really, really hurt. So that whole night I was thinking about (those misses). It was tough, but all of our games are back-to-back, so you just have to push that aside. We want to make it to the tournament, so you have to be ready to play. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>How did you first get into basketball? </b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">My whole family has been playing our whole lives. I have seven siblings, and we all played. My dad played in college, too. So I’ve been playing ever since I was little. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">My dad wanted me to play as high a level of basketball (as) I could. But my mom wanted the academic side. I felt like (Brown) was the best of both worlds. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What are your personal and team goals for the rest of the season? </b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">For personal goals, it would probably be to win (Ivy League) Rookie of the Year. For team goals, it would be to win the Ivy League Championship. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Are you surprised at how well you have played as a freshman? </b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Not really. I expected to make an impact this year, but I honestly didn’t think I’d be playing this well. So being that I am, I’m just happy that I’m doing it.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have any pre-game rituals?</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">After we eat our pre-game meal, I definitely take a nap for like an hour, or (an) hour and fifteen (minutes) while listening to music. Then I just go into the locker room and sit there for a while, and just think to myself or have on music. Then I just go and get my shots up about two hours before the game. That’s it. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What are you concentrating in and what are your goals after graduation?</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">I am majoring in engineering and (want to get) a Bachelor’s degree. After, I’m hoping to further my career in basketball. When that ends, I don’t really have a particular path for what I want to do. With all of the networking here, I’m sure I’ll find something. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have any overarching aims for your career as a Brown basketball player?</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">I haven’t really thought that far yet — right now I’m just trying to take this one day at a time. Being that it’s just my freshman year, I just want to win Rookie of the Year and make it to the NCAA Tournament. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">The Bears will take the court against Cornell Friday and Columbia Saturday at the Pizzitola Sports Center.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After traveling to competitions around New England for the past three weekends, the gymnastics team returned to the Pizzitola for its 2018 home opener. During their annual dual meet with the wrestling team, the Bears posted a 190.900 team score to land in second place ahead of Rhode Island College and behind the University of Bridgeport.

Bruno claimed two individual event titles as Kate Nelson ’21 placed first on the uneven bars, and Regan Butchness ’18 nabbed the top spot on the balance beam. Butchness was also named the Eastern College Athletic Conference Coaches Choice honoree for the week.

Prior to the competition, the team warmed up in teal “#TimesUp” T-shirts and sported matching hair ribbons to show their support for survivors of sexual assault.

“The NCAA gymnastics community has come together and has been wearing the teal ribbons all season in support of the sexual abuse (survivors),” said head coach Sara Carver-Milne. “It’s a very relevant story in our gymnastics community right now but also across the larger community. One of the first things that we teach our student-athletes when they come to Brown is that they need to have a voice, and I was pretty proud of our athletes stepping up,” she said.

“The gymnastics community is very small, and it kind of affects everyone. … It’s important to send that message that we stand with them and that we understand that it’s difficult,” Carver-Milne added.

As the home team, Brown had the advantage of competing in the Olympic order, beginning on vault. Anya Olson ’18 earned a 9.475 to give the Bears a building score. Gabrielle Hechtman ’19 and Julia Green ’19 supported with a pair of 9.425s, and Alyssa Gardner ’21 closed the rotation by scoring a 9.575.

Bruno was electric on the uneven bars, hitting all six routines to notch a season-high 48.750. Caroline Warren ’21 set the tone with a career-best 9.700, and Claire Ryan ’18 followed with a season-high 9.725. Olson and Emma Hansen ’21 posted matching 9.750s while Nelson earned a personal-best 9.825 to claim the crown.

The Bears carried that momentum to the balance beam, going six for six en route to a season-high 48.450. Ryan opened the rotation by tying her season-best 9.650, and Hansen nailed her second routine of the meet to add a 9.700. Butchness, Bruno’s most experienced beam worker, did not disappoint, notching a season-best 9.800 and solidifying her position atop the field in the final standings.

“That was a huge confidence booster for all of us,” Butchness said. “Bars and beam can be a bit trickier in terms of where there’s room for error, but for us to hit six really strong routines means that each girl who goes up can build on each other’s performances and end with a really high team score.”

Brown closed out the competition on floor exercise where deductions took a toll on the team score. Though the Bears had “three big mistakes,” per Carver-Milne, Olson and Rose Domonoske ’21 set season highs with scores of 9.675 and 9.350, respectively. Anne Christman ’20 also contributed a 9.550 to the overall 190.900.

Bruno goes back on the road Sunday as the team will travel to the University of Maryland for a quad meet including Rutgers University and the College of William and Mary.

“It’s a great opportunity for them to compete against some higher-ranked teams and be in an environment where there might be a little bit more pressure,” Carver-Milne said. “That’s only going to help us grow and be more prepared for the Ivy Classic.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The women’s basketball team was back in action this weekend, hitting the road to compete against Cornell and Columbia. The Bears (14-7, 2-6 Ivy) dropped a close one to the Big Red (6-15, 2-6) Friday but were able to collect a win against the Lions (7-16, 1-7) the next day.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In its first game, despite the 70-68 loss, Bruno outrebounded Cornell 38 to 31 and found its stroke, connecting on 26 of 56 field goal attempts. Forward Janie White ’18 recorded 14 points and 13 rebounds, while guard Justine Gaziano ’20 netted 25 points and was perfect from the three-point range, going five for five.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gaziano delivered a crucial three that would tie the game at 68 with just under a minute to play — one of eight ties in the contest. But the clutch shot wasn’t enough to fend off a Big Red victory, as Cornell scored a game-sealing layup with a second left to play.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Big Red’s defense swarmed the Bears, forcing 14 turnovers. Guard Shayna Mehta ’19 felt the effects of her difficult Ivy League competition. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We cannot take any team for granted in the Ivy League. Every team is tough and talented,” Mehta said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mehta contributed 13 points in the loss, while forward Erika Steeves ’19 added 11 points and 7 rebounds. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Visiting Columbia to play its second game of the weekend, Bruno took down the Lions 84-80, notching its second Ivy League victory and first since an overtime win over Yale Jan. 19. Mehta was happy to get back on the right track, especially after the loss of the team’s starter Taylor Will ’19. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was great to finally get another win in the Ivy League. Ever since we lost Taylor to injury, we’ve been trying to find our groove. It’s been pretty tough, but I think we’re starting to find it,” Mehta said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mehta was among five players for the Bears to score in double figures, tallying 17 points and going five for eight on three-point shooting. Joining her were Steeves and Gaziano, who picked up 18 and 15 points apiece. Steeves also grabbed 14 rebounds. White scored a career-high 21 points, and guard Dominique Leonidas ’21 added 10 points off the bench. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite Brown’s strong offense, the contest witnessed 12 lead changes and came down to the wire. Bruno trailed 38-42 at the half, but took control in the third quarter, scoring 28 points. It was Steeves, Gaziano and Leonidas who would help cinch the victory, scoring the last few points. The Bears’ defense also managed to stop the Lions at the other end in the final minutes of the game.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team will continue to fight for a spot in the Ivy League tournament this month, hosting Harvard and Dartmouth next weekend.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following a close duel with the University of Connecticut last weekend, the men’s hockey team resumed conference play with a pair of losses and fell to Princeton 7-2 Friday and Quinnipiac University 3-0 Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Zach Giuttari ’20 and Sam Lafferty ’18 led the Bears’ (6-13-4, 5-11-1 ECAC) offense against Princeton Friday as each recorded two points in the loss. Tommy Marchin ’19 also notched a goal against the Tigers.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 2, Princeton 7</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Friday night, Marchin and Giuttari both scored, but Bruno was unable to fend off a persistent Princeton (11-11-3, 8-9-1) offense.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Tigers opened scoring with a pair of goals — including one on the power play — in the first period, before Marchin narrowed the deficit to one late in the stanza. Lafferty maneuvered around a Princeton defenseman in the Bears’ offensive zone and sent a shot toward the crease where Marchin redirected the puck into the net for his team-high ninth goal of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown peppered the Princeton net with shots in the second frame and outshot the Tigers 15-10 for a two-period advantage of 27-19. Princeton added a pair of goals midway through the period, but Bruno answered when Giuttari capitalized on a power play 13 minutes into the stanza. Giuttari collected a pass from Max Gottlieb ’19 in the slot and fired a shot top shelf to extend his point streak to four games.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Tigers scored twice in the final period to secure the victory, their fifth consecutive win.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In net, goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 made 13 saves before giving way to Luke Kania ’21 in the second period. Kania stopped 12 shots as the Bears outshot the Tigers 35-32.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 0, Quinnipiac 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The following day, Bruno pressured the Quinnipiac (12-14-4, 7-9-2) net with 22 shots but was unable to break down the Bobcats’ defense as goaltender Andrew Shortridge delivered a shutout performance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Joe O’Connor gave the Bobcats an early lead in the first period by edging a shot past Kania from the slot. The Bears held off the Quinnipiac attack for the rest of the stanza, but Brandon Fortunato and Kevin Duane added a pair of unanswered goals in the second frame to claim the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Giuttari led the Bears with four shots. Kania made 23 saves as the Bobcats outshot the Bears 26-22.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Guys are getting a lot of shots — they’re doing a lot of good things,” Kania said. “If we just stick to the process, the goals will come, and we’ll get some wins.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With only four games remaining in the regular season, the Bears seek to translate their offensive opportunities into goals by gaining composure in front of the net and capitalizing on rebounds.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve got to have a little bit more of a poise around the net. I think a lot of times (when) there are pucks there, we just throw them right back into the goaltender,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “We need to take away the goalie’s eyes; we need those second chances, those third chances — that’s how we’re going to generate offense.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno went 4-for-6 on the penalty kill over the weekend. The team hopes to achieve a greater balance between playing with aggression and passivity on the kill, Whittet said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We have a tendency to be so passive at times that it leads ... to a lot of possession and then your penalty killers get tired,” Whittet said. “When your penalty killers get tired, systematically you kind of fall apart, so that’s why we’ve got to know when we should press and when we shouldn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mentally, the Bears remain positive and maintain their day-by-day approach leading up to the ECAC playoffs, which begin March 2.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We just want to come to the rink every day and work hard, get better every day — it’s a process,” Kania said. “We’re a never-give-up team — we’ve had our struggles this year, and we’ve been good this year, so we just battle through and keep fighting.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will close out away competition for the regular season with visits to No.3 Cornell Friday and Colgate University Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s3">After splitting its games last weekend, the men’s basketball team fell to Cornell Friday before riding the rebounding of Tamenang Choh ’21 and clutch shooting of Obi Okolie ’19 to an overtime victory against Columbia Saturday. Okolie hit a three-pointer in the waning seconds of the game to secure the victory over the Lions. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With the weekend’s results, the Bears (11-10, 4-4 Ivy) remain in a third-place tie in the Ivy League standings. As Bruno prepares for its final six games of the regular season, the team is positioned to qualify for the Ivy League Tournament in March. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Every game is so important,” said Head Coach Mike Martin ’04. “We’ve won some really close games so far in this league. ... We’re confident.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 60, Cornell 78</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown did not look prepared at the start of the game against the Big Red (9-12, 3-5). The Bears did not respond well to Cornell’s full-court press, and shot 0-8 to start the contest and fall into an early 13-0 hole. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We got some good looks early that didn’t go down,” Martin said. “We were just a little bit rushed offensively once we got down, and our defense didn’t allow us to get out in transition.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown was unable to recover from the early deficit in the first half. Cornell shot a hot 60 percent from the field and played stifling defense against Bruno’s offensive attack. At halftime, Cornell held a 47-35 lead. Following last weekend’s game-winning performance against Princeton, Desmond Cambridge ’21 was a standout again for the Bears, scoring 16 first-half points with three rebounds.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the second stanza, Brown came out slow once again and allowed the Cornell advantage to quickly widen to 18 points. But the Bears refused to give up and tried to claw their way back into the game. An athletic block from Choh woke up the Pizzitola Sports Center, as a shot from Okolie trimmed the Big Red lead to 13. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Bears were ultimately unable to break through Cornell’s defense, ceding<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an 18-point loss. Cambridge was the star for Brown with 26 points, followed by Okolie, who notched eight points. The team recorded 20 offensive rebounds and shot 31 percent from the field, compared to Cornell’s 55 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Tonight was probably a reality check for all of us,” Martin said. “If we thought that we were better than we are, tonight showed us that we are not.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 91, Columbia 88 (OT)</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Lions (6-15, 3-5) were blazing hot from the opening tip, as Columbia started the contest with three straight three-pointers. Their 7-8 shooting mark helped them jump out to an early 17-7 lead. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Bears were not ready to allow a repeat of the night before. The duo of Brandon Anderson ’20 and Cambridge powered Bruno to match Columbia’s high-scoring attack. A thunderous breakaway dunk from Okolie tied the game at 20 and gave the Bears momentum. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the half, the Bears led 36-29, paced by Cambridge’s 13-point effort. Zach Hunsaker ’20 also notched nine points and two rebounds. Both squads shot 37 percent from the field and grabbed 22 rebounds. </span></p>
<p class="p3">In the second half, Brown and Columbia continued to trade blows and keep the game close. Cambridge electrified the crowd with a 360-degree dunk, but two costly fouls on Columbia’s three-point attempts kept the Lions in the game.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With seven minutes remaining, Columbia took a six-point lead on a three-pointer from Lukas Meisner and jump shot from Mike Smith. But Cambridge managed to get free with an athletic spin and drove to the basket for a vicious dunk to keep the Bears within striking distance. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But a minute later, Cambridge went down with an apparent ankle injury on an attempted block, and would not play the rest of the game. With four minutes to play, Choh drove to the basket to complete an and-one layup to tie the game at 69.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anderson completed a reverse layup with just 59 seconds remaining in the game to give the Bears a slim one-point lead. After Smith missed a three-point shot, Anderson gave Bruno a three-point lead on a jump shot with just 18 seconds left in the contest.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Smith drained a contested trey with five seconds to go to tie the game at 77, and Anderson could not sink the open shot to win the game at the buzzer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In overtime, both squads started strongly, each making a three-pointer to level the game at 82. With a minute and a half to play, Kyle Castlin drained two free throws to give the Lions a three-point edge. But Choh knocked in a tough layup moments later to trim the Lions’ lead down to one. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After two free throws from Smith extended the Columbia lead to three, Anderson was fouled with 13 seconds remaining and sank his first free throw. He missed the second, but Choh got the clutch offensive rebound and passed to Okolie behind the three-point arc. Okolie launched a step-back three and made the shot with nine seconds left to give the Bears a one-point lead. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was a huge rebound by (Choh),” Okolie said. “He had the awareness to pass it out to me, and they were scrambling off his rebound. So I stepped up and made the three.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Smith took the ball coast-to-coast and attempted a layup with two seconds remaining, but could not get the shot to fall. Okolie got the rebound and was fouled, making both his free throws to extend Bruno’s lead to three. He would finish the game with 12 points. Smith missed a half-court heave as the buzzer sounded, propelling the Bears to a much-needed victory. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I can’t tell you how proud I am of our players,” Martin said. “It wasn’t going our way, but we fought through it.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cambridge finished leading all Brown scorers with 23 points, followed by Anderson with 17 points and Hunsaker with 15 points. The Bears shot 48 percent from the field and recorded 42 rebounds. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“That was college basketball at its finest,” Martin said. “Ultimately we made one more play than they did.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will take to the road next weekend, facing conference-leading Harvard Friday and Dartmouth Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Most people can remember running a timed mile in gym class, but few can fathom what it would be like to cover the distance in under four minutes. To put such a feat into perspective: There are more than 560 billionaires living in the United States today, but only 510 Americans in history have broken four minutes for the mile. On Saturday, Martin Martinez ’18 became the 509th American sub-four miler, recording a time of 3 minutes, 59.38 seconds at the Boston University Valentine Invitational — good for sixth place in a field that included four professional runners. This record-breaking run made Martinez the first athlete in Brown history to crack four minutes on an indoor track and the first to do so since Greg Whiteley ’89 broke four minutes outdoors.</p>
<p class="p2">The race was Martinez’s second breakout performance of the indoor season. At the Boston University Terrier Invitational in January, the senior captain won his heat in the 3000-meter race in 7:59 — the second-fastest time in Brown history. Martinez’s marks in the mile and 3000 are the best in the Ivy League this season, making him a favorite to win one or more individual titles at the Ivy League Heptagonal Indoor Track and Field Championships later this month. For his recent exploits on the track, Martinez has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Herald: Congratulations on becoming the 509th sub-four-minute miler in American history. How does it feel to join that exclusive club? </b></p>
<p class="p2">Martinez: It hasn’t quite set in. As a distance runner, it’s one of those things that you always think of. When you’re 15, 16 years old, everyone has the goal of being a sub-four miler. I was lucky to be in a good race and be fit when everything came together.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What signs in your training indicated that you were ready to run under four minutes?</b></p>
<p class="p2">The last few years, (Head Coach Tim Springfield and I have) felt that we’ve been at a fitness level where, given the right race, we could do it. At the first BU meet, we broke eight (minutes) for 3000; I felt good doing that. I knew that I was in a position where I could potentially run sub-four in a few different ways. I just had to get in a race where I had an opportunity to do it.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Walk us through the race. </b></p>
<p class="p2">The heat was a big mix of talent levels, with a few pros and a few collegians. Going into the race, I was kind of nervous. I didn’t know if I was ready to run with Nike Oregon Project runners. I just went in there with the mindset that I wasn’t thinking about time; I was just thinking about competing.</p>
<p class="p2">At about 1000 meters in I was starting to hurt. Then with 200 to go, I looked up at the clock and saw 3:29, so I was like, “We gotta buckle down here, run a 30(-second last lap).”</p>
<p class="p4"><b>How did your coaches and teammates react?</b></p>
<p class="p2">There was a five-second delay waiting for the time to pop up on the screen and see officially if it was sub-four. Then it was like, “Holy Crap!”</p>
<p class="p2">I ran over to Tim and gave him a big hug, which is kind of funny looking back. There were some guys on the back bend, so I went over and gave them some high fives. The whole night and the next day, I was getting so many messages from alumni and different guys congratulating me, sharing the experience a little. Because I was the first to do it for Brown, I think a lot of guys I’d trained with felt a connection.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>You and a few teammates spent time training in Mexico over winter break. How was the running down there?</b></p>
<p class="p2">It was actually in my grandmother’s hometown. Her house is at about 5,000 feet (above sea level); the idea was to get some nice training at altitude.</p>
<p class="p2">We were in rural Mexico, so it was farmland. It was all dirt roads. We had access to a 400-meter dirt track that was pretty nice. It was great running. I hadn’t been there in 10 years — since I was about 13. My grandfather had recently passed away, so I figured it would be nice for us to see my grandmother and make sure she wasn’t by herself.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A labrum tear in your hip kept you out of competition from summer 2015 until fall 2016. While you were sidelined, did you ever doubt that you would regain your previous level of fitness?</b></p>
<p class="p2">It was a long climb back. … Prior to my 3000 two weeks ago, I hadn’t (set a new personal record) in two years. I had a big year my sophomore year, then I was injured. Then the year I came back I didn’t PR. Even last cross country season was kind of a disappointment.</p>
<p class="p2">There were a lot of moments when it was tough. After surgery, I didn’t run for four or five months. It’s tough to go through the rehab and be on the sideline. I don’t think I doubted that I’d come back and give it a shot, but there was a lot of doubt that I could come back at the same level and get back to where I was prior to surgery.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>You were originally slated to graduate in May 2017. Why did you decide to stay on and compete for a fifth year?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I had the option of graduating in normal time and using my remaining eligibility at a different school, like Ned (Willig ’16) and Will (Sheeran ’16) when they went to the University of Michigan. They’d also had some injuries and decided they wanted to use their eligibility at a more traditional state-style school.</p>
<p class="p2">When I was injured, I talked with Tim and decided I wanted to finish my NCAA eligibility with the team and the coach I started with. Looking back, I’m happy I made that decision. The coolest part about this has been breaking four with Brown and being the first one to do it.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Which events will you run at the Ivy League Heptagonal Indoor Track and Field Championship? Will you race in both the 3000 and the mile?</b></p>
<p class="p2">It’s still up in the air. There’s some strategy to where you put your guys.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>A number of college coaches recruited you out of high school. Why did you choose Brown? </b></p>
<p class="p2">Brown was the only Ivy I was looking at. I was mostly looking at schools in the Midwest — University of Illinois, Iowa State (University) and (University of) Notre Dame. But it really wasn’t much of a contest; I was set on Brown the whole time. Tim kind of sold me, and the opportunity to go to an Ivy League school was a really big thing for me.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What are your plans for running ­­— and life in general — after Brown? Do you hope to extend your competitive track career beyond graduation?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Right now, I’m just trying to focus on this season. A lot of it depends on how the rest of the year goes — where my marks end up falling. I think most likely I’ll be done after the end of this year. Ultimately, a few years out, the plan is to apply to law school.</p>

		<title>Eight-year-old Harry Borodemos signs with men’s hockey</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Eight-year-old Harry Borodemos, a student from Fall River, Massachusetts, became the newest addition to the Brown men’s ice hockey team roster at a Team IMPACT Draft Day held at the Pizzitola Sports Center Monday. Borodemos is the ninth student to officially join a team at Brown — and the third to sign with the men’s ice hockey team — through Team IMPACT, an organization that pairs children diagnosed with chronic or life-threatening illnesses with collegiate teams.</p>
<p class="p2">As a member of the team, Borodemos received his own personalized jersey, locker and other gear, and will attend practices, games and events. The team will also visit Borodemos and attend events at his school, including sports contests and recitals, providing support for him and his family.</p>
<p class="p2">“(Team members) will really become part of the fabric of his family, and … this group of individuals I think will get a lot out of it,” said Seth Rosenzweig, executive director of Team IMPACT. “At the same time, the family feels like they actually have a support network around them to help them during a challenging moment in a medical journey.”</p>
<p class="p2">The idea to extend the University’s involvement with Team IMPACT and find a match for the hockey team originally came from senior goaltender Connor Maher ’18, who previously interned at one of the organization’s offices as a high school student. At the end of his junior year, Maher proposed the idea of pairing with Team IMPACT to men’s hockey head coach Brendan Whittet ’94, who followed up on the opportunity.</p>
<p class="p2">“I actually worked in the same office as Team IMPACT back when I was in high school …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>so I was exposed to the program a little bit, and I’ve been thinking about it ever since,” Maher said. “I wanted to get the team involved, and last year when I was towards the end of my junior year — a rising senior — I just thought it was a good time to get involved where I could really grab it and run with it, just kind of take the lead.”</p>
<p class="p2">The process of matching a child with a collegiate team begins with Team IMPACT staff outreach, Rosenzweig said. If a child is referred by a local hospital, Team IMPACT will vet the children and their families to ensure that they are a good fit for the organization and are able to make the time commitment. The organization will then find a team that is in close proximity to the family and is enthusiastic about welcoming a Team IMPACT recruit and train the players in preparation for the experience.</p>
<p class="p2">Borodemos will be an official team member for about two years before graduating in a formal ceremony and joining Team IMPACT’s alumni program. Whittet said that he hopes that the match will be impactful not only for Borodemos, but also for the team.</p>
<p class="p2">“I want (the team) to understand that there’s a big world out there, there are people that are battling every day and there are things that come up in people’s lives,” Whittet said. “If we in any small way can make (Borodemos’) life at this juncture more positive by having him be a part of our program, that’s a great thing.”</p>
<p class="p2">Having Borodemos around the locker room has already improved spirits, said captain Josh McArdle ’18. “His attitude is incredible and he never seems down,” McArdle said. “To have that around really shows us that any trouble we’re going through really isn’t that bad, and he actually inspires us probably more than we inspire him.”</p>
<p class="p2">Since its establishment in 2011, Team IMPACT has paired over 1,400 students with teams at more than 500 colleges and universities in 47 states. At Brown, the women’s ice hockey, women’s basketball, men’s basketball, baseball, men’s lacrosse, men’s soccer and men’s tennis teams have signed students through the program.</p>
<p class="p2">The organization seeks to expand both nationally and internationally in the coming years and has already received interest from Canada and countries in Europe, Rosenzweig said.</p>
<p class="p2">“We currently have 1,200 teams on a waiting list, so our biggest opportunity is to find as many kids as possible that could benefit,” Rosenzweig said. “The dream would be to have every child that’s living with a serious or chronic illness and every college athlete experience the power of this.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The men’s basketball team’s hopes to make Ivy League playoffs were dashed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this weekend, as close losses to Harvard and Dartmouth gave Brown a losing record with just four conference contests remaining in the season. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears are still positioned at fourth place in the Ivy League, but are locked in a three-way tie for the final playoff spot with Cornell and Columbia. This weekend’s matchups against the Big Red and the Lions will prove pivotal in deciding Bruno’s postseason fate. </span></p>
<p class="p4">“We know it’s a big weekend and we’re hungry to get these wins,” said Travis Fuller ’19. “We started this week off with a great practice and we’ll look to continue to be sharp in preparation.”</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 58, Harvard 65</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears looked strong in the opening half against the Crimson, and were led by Brandon Anderson ’20, who finished the period with eight points. Brown also outshot Harvard in the first half, shooting 34 percent from the field compared to the Crimson’s 30 percent. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Bears missed all three of their free throw attempts in the first period, and fell to a 27-25 halftime deficit. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the second stanza, Brown managed to keep up with the high-powered Harvard squad and tied the game off of a tip from Obi Okolie ’19 with four minutes of play remaining. But Harvard forward Seth Towns took over in the final minutes and put the game out of reach for Bruno with a three. He finished with a game-high 24 points. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anderson led all Brown scorers with 17 points, followed by Tamenang Choh ’21 who came off the bench to score 11. Desmond Cambridge ’21 also notched 10. The team shot 38 percent from the field and recorded 33 rebounds. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 63, Dartmouth 66</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno sought to respond from the loss the night before with a win against last-placed Dartmouth, but the Big Green was hungry for revenge after Zach Hunsaker’s ’20 buzzer-beater gave Brown the victory in their last matchup. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the first half, Dartmouth came out strong, and jumped out to a 37-34 lead on hot three-point shooting. The Big Green knocked in six treys, compared to just one from Brown. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">After half-time, the Bears began to heat up and looked ready to take control of the game. A strong layup from Hunsaker gave Brown a 46-40 lead with 15 minutes remaining in the contest. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Big Green came all the way back in just four minutes to take a 51-50 lead and gain momentum. In a tied game with three minutes remaining, Chris Knight hit two clutch shots to put Dartmouth ahead by four. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Anderson managed to get open for a three-point shot to cut the Big Green’s lead to one with barely a minute left to play. After Dartmouth knocked in a layup, Hunsaker was fouled and made two free throws to once again put the Bears in striking distance.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Knight missed a contested shot with 23 seconds to go, and the Bears gained possession with a chance for another miracle victory. Hunsaker broke free from his defender and launched a possible game-winning three with only four seconds remaining. The shot did not find the bottom of the net, but Cambridge collected the offensive rebound. Cambridge put up a putback layup as time expired but it did not go in, sending the Bears to a brutal loss. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno finished the game shooting 38 percent from the field and only 18 percent from beyond the three point arc. Cambridge led all Brown scorers with 13 points, followed by Anderson and Choh with 11 points each.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While Fuller doesn’t “really have an answer” for what the team didn’t do well enough, “I think we’ll be ready to play this weekend,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will stay on the road this weekend, facing Columbia Friday and Cornell Saturday as the Ivy League season nears a suspenseful conclusion. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Barash-David ’19: Let athletes be activists</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/22/barash-david-19let-athletes-be-activists/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In 1968, American Olympians Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood on the podium in Mexico City shoeless. With bowed heads and raised fists during the playing of the National Anthem, the two Olympians protested after coming in first and third respectively in the 200 meter dash. They did so to bring attention to the ongoing discrimination of black Americans.</p>
<p class="p2">After the demonstration, a young sportswriter by the name of Brent Musburger, a man who would go on to become one of the United States’ foremost broadcasters, penned a column on the famous protest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Musburger called the two activists “militants,” “juvenile” and — in what is one of the most tactless and impolitic utterances of his long career (though he accrued an unfortunate collection of insensitive and inappropriate statements prior to his retirement from ESPN in 2017) — “black-skinned Stormtroopers.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Perhaps it’s time that 20-year-old athletes quit passing themselves off as social philosophers,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="p2">Last week, responding to a podcast in which LeBron James and Kevin Durant were critical of President Trump, Fox News host Laura Ingraham went on air and called their statements “barely intelligible, not to mention ungrammatical.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Must they run their mouths like that?” she asked, echoing Musburger’s half-century old sentiment. “It’s always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year to bounce a ball.”</p>
<p class="p2">Ingraham then added, “So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, ‘Shut up and dribble.’”</p>
<p class="p2">The claim was unsurprising to anyone familiar with Fox News anchors’ collective body of work: insensitive, unfiltered and intentionally provocative.</p>
<p class="p2">James has since responded, recently tweeting “#wewillnotshutupanddribble.” Durant also responded that Ingraham’s comments were racist.</p>
<p class="p2">Ours is an epoch of activist athletes, but the advent of such figures is by no means novel. During the Vietnam War, Muhammad Ali, a conscientious objector, refused to enlist. “My conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people or some hungry people in the mud for big powerful America,” Ali said. He was arrested and convicted for the offense.</p>
<p class="p2">In a moderated conversation with Ali, television host David Susskind responded, “I find nothing amusing or interesting or tolerable about this man. … He’s a disgrace to his country, his race and what he laughingly describes as his profession. … He’s a simplistic fool and a pawn.”</p>
<p class="p2">This kind of visceral and polemical response always succeeds the tradition of activism and advocacy by athletes. After every display of political commentary by a black athlete, a predictable retort falls from the mouths of predominantly white commentators: Shut up and stick to sports.</p>
<p class="p2">Ingraham’s comments contribute to this prevailing reduction of athletes to their physical capabilities, dismissing their personhood and viewpoints.</p>
<p class="p2">The rhetoric employed to silence athletes often relies, at least in part, on the devaluation of their intellectual personhood. Thus, these commentators position athletes not as sentient, caring, thoughtful people, but rather as vacuous automatons whose raison d’etre is to trot onto the field of play and entertain us.</p>
<p class="p2">But the players don’t see it that way. In fact, many professional athletes use their positions as public figures — and considerable income — for good. James’ foundation, working in concert with the Akron, Ohio, school board, just opened a new public school, an accomplishment which he considers to be among the most important things he’s done in his career. “Besides having three kids and marrying my wife, putting my mom in a position where she never has to worry about anything again for the rest of her life, this is right up there,” he said. “Championships, MVPs, I mean, points, rebounds and assists, that stuff is whatever.”</p>
<p class="p2">In the past few years, James has expanded his “I Promise” program to include 1,128 students, a cohort of Akron schoolchildren for which he will provide four-year college scholarships. But Ingraham didn’t mention these accomplishments. Ingraham also didn’t mention the tens of thousands of dollars Durant has donated to Positive Tomorrows — an Oklahoma City school for homeless children — in the past three years.</p>
<p class="p2">At the heart of Ingraham’s comments lies something beyond a deep-seated antipathy to James and Durant’s opinion of Trump. The flippancy with which Ingraham responds to their comments is emblematic of her condescension. To her, these athletes do not possess the intellectual capacity to offer comment.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That isn’t to say we should<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>value the opinions of an athlete only when they are involved in their community. We shouldn’t accept an athlete’s point of view only because they have donated a certain amount of money to a worthy cause. We should an accept an athlete’s point of view because they are human. To pare down the value of a black athlete such that their only contributions of note take place within the lines of play is not only racist and reductive — it’s dehumanizing. I do not wish to make some sweeping indictment of the deterioration of civil discourse in our current political moment, but to respect the personhood of an athlete and the value of their insight is certainly a low bar to surpass.</span></p>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: Holy cow — MLB didn’t blow it!</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/22/schapiro-19-holy-cow-mlb-didnt-blow/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you know me, you know I’ve been no fan of many of Major League Baseball’s proposed pace-of-play initiatives over the years. Many of the changes suggested even recently, like banning defensive shifts, limiting pitching changes or instituting a pitch clock, would be harmful either to the players or to the game itself. Some ideas — such as automatically placing runners on second base in extra innings, or, as is reportedly being “whispered” by some MLB officials, allowing losing teams to disregard their batting orders in the ninth inning — are so clearly inane that they don’t merit serious consideration. But earlier this week, MLB announced its pace-of-play changes for the 2018 season, and somehow, they didn’t screw it up. In fact, they did a pretty good job.</p>
<p class="p2">Right off the bat, there’s a caveat that needs to be mentioned: Some people, myself included, don’t think that pace of play is actually a problem. MLB games have lasted around three hours since I’ve been watching them, and I’ve never had a problem with it. To some, this means that any action on the issue is misguided — if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. But even though I understand this group’s point, I don’t wholly agree with it. Pace of play isn’t something I’m worried about, but even so, MLB’s recently announced rule changes are far from the worst thing in the world.</p>
<p class="p2">MLB’s announced rule changes have two major components: limiting mound visits and quickening the time between innings. The changes are relatively straightforward. Each team is allowed six mound visits without a pitching change per game, and pitchers must now deliver their first pitch of an inning within five seconds of the 2:05 countdown reaching zero.</p>
<p class="p2">Even these small changes have elicited some criticism. It’s awfully hard to complain about shortening the time between innings, but I have seen some anger that pitcher-catcher conferences will be limited. But as much of a baseball purist as I am, I can’t get too worked up about this. For one, six non-pitching change mound visits is a lot. The definition of “mound visit” has been expanded to include trips to the mound by position players, but still, it’s not often that you see more than six non-pitching change mound visits in a game.</p>
<p class="p2">And anyway, even if mound visits were much more limited, it’s just about the smallest change you can imagine. If MLB decided to allow only two non-pitching change mound visits per game, baseball would be almost entirely unchanged. This rule change is the rare example of a pace-of-play rule that works exactly as such rules should. It allows the game to continue completely uninterrupted while eliminating the clearly gratuitous sources of delay: multiple conferences with the entire infield, talks with the catcher after every other pitch, etc. In fact, the various exceptions to this rule — for pitcher injury, sign cross-ups and the like — could make for interesting stories in their own right, as crafty catchers will be forced to concoct convincing rationales for extra mound visits and deliver them to home plate umpires.</p>
<p class="p2">Improving the transition between innings is likewise minimally invasive: It eliminates unnecessary delays while not changing the way the game is played at all. No one advocates for longer commercials, and it’s hard to argue that long breaks between innings are part of baseball’s heritage or somehow essential to the game’s integrity. This, again, is exactly the kind of rule change we need. If effective, it will speed up the game without changing gameplay, and if ineffective, it doesn’t have any serious potential downsides.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, MLB probably plans to go further than this eventually. Commissioner Rob Manfred’s desire to implement a pitch clock might be the worst-kept secret in baseball, and some of his rhetoric on the issue of pace-of-play has been downright alarming. My support for the current rule changes does not mean that I will accept relief pitcher limits and pitch clocks a year from now; I will continue to staunchly oppose any proposed rule that alters the way the game is played or subjects players to increased risk of injury. Pace-of-play rules, if we must have them, should make the game faster, not different. We’ve played baseball the same way for more than a century, and there’s no reason to change it.</p>
<p class="p2">But for now, MLB has issued a common-sense, widely accepted set of new rules, and we should all be thankful for it. Whatever odious rule changes may come in the future, I’ll address them when they arrive. Let’s hope that games get faster this season, rendering further pace-of-play rules unnecessary — I’m hopeful, but not quite optimistic, that they will. Right now, we’ve got a full season of baseball ahead of us with no clocks, strange rules or automatic baserunners. Let’s savor that while we can and applaud MLB for letting it happen.</p>

After scoring a career-high 21 points against Harvard Friday, Leonidas posted 15 points the following night against Dartmouth on an efficient 7-12 shooting. In her last three games, Leonidas has shot an impressive 63 percent from the field. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For her high-scoring efforts last weekend, Leonidas was awarded the honor of Ivy League Rookie of the Week and has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Herald: Congratulations on winning Ivy League Rookie of the Week. How does it feel to be recognized for your performance in your freshman season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leonidas: If I’m being honest, I don’t really think about it that much. It is a pretty cool accomplishment. My main focus is working hard every day, being consistent and making sure that I play my best every single day. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>When did you first get involved with basketball?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I started playing basketball when I was five. I used to play with my brother and sister all the time outside with all of the guys in the neighborhood. I always was playing outside with boys, so that’s pretty much where I started.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>When did you start to think that you had a realistic chance of playing college basketball?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Honestly, it was always a goal of mine when I was young that I wanted to play college basketball when I (got) older. I think I started believing in it during freshman year of high school. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I decided to come to Brown so I could get the best of both worlds, academic side and athletic side. I really had a cool connection with my head coach and I thought she was great. I love the girls — the teammates are great. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Do you have any pre-game rituals?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We usually have a pre-game meal … as a team. Depending on the day, I might take a nap. Then I will just listen to music and get ready. Then I will pray, and it’s game-time. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What would you say has been your favorite part of being on the basketball team this season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My favorite part is definitely being around the girls all the time. They’re fun and we always have great laughs. Coming in, I was a little nervous about how I would fit in and how things would go. But the team has definitely welcomed me in, especially (with) the seniors doing a good job of helping me get used to the little things. Being with them is definitely the best part.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What are your personal and team goals for the rest of the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Personally, it’s just to take it day by day, live in the moment and have fun. … As a team our focus right now is just to finish strong and end the season on a good note. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Do you have an overarching goal for your career with the basketball team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I just want to play hard and win games. Obviously, we want to someday win the Ivy League Championship. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What do you hope to do after graduating?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Right now, I’m undecided. I’m thinking about public health, but I’m not sure. I’m just trying to figure things out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The Bears will return to the court to host Columbia Friday and Cornell Saturday at the Pizzitola Sports Center. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On Friday, four members of the men’s track and field team — Captain Tosin Oyewole ’18, Captain Zack Emrich ’18, Zachary Lanigan ’20 and Martin Martinez ’18 — flew to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to compete in the UCS Invitational, squaring off against some of the nation’s top teams in the distance medley relay. Bruno upset several NCAA powerhouses — including Arkansas, Florida and Virginia — to take fourth place over the 4,000-meter distance. After applying the NCAA’s flat-track conversion rate, Brown’s cumulative time of 9:37.6translates to 9:29.9 for national qualification purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown’s time currently ranks twelfth on the national list. After the qualification window closes Feb. 25, the top 12 DMR squads in the country will receive berths to next month’s NCAA Division I Indoor National Championship in College Station, Texas. With only one weekend’s worth of meets remaining in the qualifying period, the Bears will punch their tickets to Texas if they hold their position.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head Coach Tim Springfield tabbed Lanigan — who boasts the second-fastest times in the Ivy League this season for both 800 and 1,000 meters — to lead off for the Bears. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The race “was a little rough in the beginning. … I was aggressive in holding my ground,” Lanigan said. Robert Domanic, “the 3:54 miler from Ole Miss, came up on my shoulder. He tried to cut my lane, so I gave him a bit of a push. The Ole Miss coach actually yelled at me.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though Lanigan kept pace with the frontrunners for most of the opening 1,200-meter leg, the Australian’s wheels fell off a bit in the final stretch.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think my race ended at about the 1,120 (meter mark). I kind of faded a little bit,” Lanigan said. He nevertheless recorded a strong time of 2:57.8 for his carry, crossing the line in fifth position, 2.7 seconds out of first.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team’s 400-meter man, Oyewole, took off like a shot upon receiving the baton from Lanigan. For an intense 49.34 seconds, the senior captain wrestled with centripetal force, delivering his team to the handoff zone in sixth place overall. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Oyewole was unhappy with his performance, explaining that a long-standing lower back complaint, aggravated by the unbanked track surface, had restricted his speed around the curves. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I hate (the flat track) with a burning passion, especially with my lower back injury. Running those tight turns on a flat track really does not translate well for me,” he said. “But you have to put those excuses aside and try to give your teammates the best performance you can.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One captain handed off to another as Emrich set off on the third 800-meter leg of the relay. Though he was 4.2 seconds behind the leaders at the outset, Emrich remained undaunted. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I was just focused on competing with the guys in front of me,” he said. “A race environment with that much intensity — it’s really easy to bring it, especially when you’re surrounded by your teammates.” Emrich, whose 1:50.3 split time was the third-fastest in the field, passed a flagging rival from Virginia to lift Brown into fifth place.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then it was all down to Martinez on the 1,600-meter closing leg. The sub-four miler sprinted to catch the leaders. “I went out in about 27 (seconds) for the first 200 (meters) and about 57 (seconds) for the 400, which obviously isn’t ideal if you’re trying to run a fast time,” Martinez said. “I was really hurting at 600.” Despite the blazing early pace, Martinez closed strongly, coming home fourth in a time of 4:00.2 — the second-fastest split of the day. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the finish, Brown’s contingent of coaches and athletes burst into celebration. “Our head coach, Tim Springfield — when he’s very excited, he likes to give this Tiger Woods fist pump,” Oyewole said. “He did exactly that when Martin crossed the line.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We were hooting and hollering, running around with each other,” Emrich added. “I don’t think anyone got to bed before 1:30 in the morning, we were so amped up on adrenaline and nervous energy.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Having made their best effort to qualify for nationals, all the quartet can do is wait and see if their time will still rank in the top 12 come Feb. 25. “We’re hoping that we’re safe. There’s a little bit of uncertainty around that, but we think we have a pretty good shot right now,” Martinez said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Oyewole put it even more succinctly: “I’m praying that we make it.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Houston Astros won a thrilling, seven-game World Series last October. The victory made for a nice underdog story, as a team without a single championship in its history defeated the powerhouse Los Angeles Dodgers. But now as spring training commences, all is not harmonious and joyful in the baseball universe. The Evil Empire in New York is back. The Yankees are loaded from the top to the bottom of their roster and boast the best pair of sluggers — Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton — since David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez starred in Boston. Not only that, the Bronx Bombers aren’t even that evil, not with Judge’s sheepish grin leading the team out onto the field. The Yankees are almost unfairly good and fun. The other 29 teams better look out.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">New York’s depth chart reads like a creation on franchise mode in <i>MLB The Show</i>. By acquiring Stanton in the offseason, the Bombers now possess the only player in the league who hit more home runs than Judge’s 52. Stanton slammed 59 round-trippers last year, tying the ninth-highest total ever in a single season. The only players who surpassed Stanton’s mark were Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Roger Maris and Babe Ruth. And three of those players were on steroids. Judge, meanwhile, tied the 20th-highest total for homers in one season as a rookie. Stanton and Judge combined for 111 home runs, 246 runs batted in and 15.7 wins above replacement. Yikes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And the rest of the Yankees are good too. Lost in all the Stanton excitement is catcher Gary Sanchez, who collected 33 home runs and 90 RBIs last season. He’s an All-Star player and a dark horse MVP candidate. Shortstop Didi Gregorius hit 25 home runs and 87 RBIs. Outfielder Brett Gardner added 21 home runs and 64 RBI (and 23 stolen bases). It’s difficult to perceive any real weakness in New York’s offense. Even if pitchers are able to escape the Judge-Stanton nightmare, the rest of the lineup is no joke.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">New York is solid in pitching too and will surely be in the running for an in-season trade. Luis Severino broke out in 2017 at age 23 with 230 strikeouts, a 2.98 earned runs average and 1.04 walks and hits per innings pitched. Masahiro Tanaka bounced back from a rough regular season to dominate in the playoffs, allowing only 10 hits, three walks and two earned runs in 20 innings. Sonny Gray looked closer to his Oakland self in 2017 — he should only improve from here on out. C.C. Sabathia and Jordan Montgomery round out the rotation. The bullpen is also overpowering. Between David Robertson, Dellin Betances and Aroldis Chapman, the Yankees should be able to close out games with no problems. Chapman and Betances suffered through brutal stretches last season, and the bullpen was still plenty threatening. There is no reason that New York’s relievers cannot perform at a more consistent level in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are plenty of other fanbases that would be eager to contest the claim of New York’s dominance, but to put it simply, none of the other teams in the league can match the Yankees.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What about the rival Boston Red Sox, who just signed slugging free agent J.D. Martinez? Boston certainly has a talented team on paper, but something is not clicking in the clubhouse. Mookie Betts and Xander Bogaerts both talked about the need for an attitude adjustment. David Price caused a variety of internal issues last season, namely accosting Red Sox broadcaster and Hall of Fame pitcher Dennis Eckersley on a team plane. Price needs to show that he is worth his massive contract if Boston hopes for playoff success. That doesn’t seem likely the way things have gone so far.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another World Series contender, the Los Angeles Dodgers have a terrific all-around team but lack the punch of a Judge-Stanton pairing. First baseman Cody Bellinger struggled in the playoffs after hitting 39 home runs in his rookie year — he must make an adjustment heading into 2018. Clayton Kershaw is the best pitcher in baseball. However, he still has not put it all together in the postseason, with a 4.35 ERA in 122 playoff innings. The lefty will have to step up if Los Angeles faces New York in the World Series.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a Cubs fan, I’d love to write that the addition of pitcher Yu Darvish pushes Chicago into contention with New York. It isn’t true though. The Cubbies still fall short among the league’s best. Anthony Rizzo and Kris Bryant are special, but there are too many disappointments on this roster. Jason Heyward, Kyle Schwarber, Addison Russell, Jon Lester and Ben Zobrist all underperformed last year. The Cubs could really use improvements from those players this season, but Heyward is already a lost cause offensively at this point, and Zobrist is yet another year older. Chicago is not quite back at the top.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Houston Astros are the Yankees’ biggest threat. Between Jose Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa and others, the Astros are just as good as the Yankees on offense. Justin Verlander and Dallas Keuchel are stars at the top of Houston’s starting rotation. The bullpen does not have as much potential to dominate as New York’s, but still held off the Dodgers enough in the World Series when it mattered most. The fact remains though that in recent times, repeating a championship has proven too daunting a challenge for top teams. The Cubs looked ready to win for the foreseeable future after 2016 but fell off dramatically the following season. The Kansas City Royals dropped out of the postseason altogether. The San Francisco Giants declined precipitously over the next couple of years after 2014. The Astros will have to stay away from the championship hangover, which is easier said than done. The Yankees, meanwhile, are coming in after missing the World Series by one game, with everything still left to play for. My money is on the hungrier team.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Following visits to Cornell and Colgate last weekend, the men’s hockey team closed out its regular season with a pair of home victories over Harvard 6-4 Friday and Dartmouth 3-0 Saturday.</p>
<p class="p4">Sam Lafferty ’18 scored his first career hat trick in the third period Friday, fueling the Bears (8-17-4, 7-14-1 ECAC) to their first win over the Crimson since the 2014-15 season. Rookie goaltender Luke Kania ’21 posted a career-high 41 saves against Harvard, before stopping 29 shots for his first collegiate shutout against Dartmouth the following night.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Brown 6, Harvard 4</b></p>
<p class="p4">Friday night, a four-goal third period powered Bruno to victory over Harvard (13-12-4, 11-8-3).</p>
<p class="p4">Alex Brink ’19 opened scoring for the Bears midway through the first period, firing a shot from the right circle past goaltender Michael Lackey. Bruno peppered the Harvard net with shots, outshooting the Crimson 14-10 in the stanza.</p>
<p class="p4">Early in the second period, Trey Dodd ’20 added a shorthanded goal on a breakaway to widen the Bears’ lead. After taking advantage of a turnover in Bruno’s defensive zone, Dodd skated past Crimson defenseman Adam Fox and sent the puck over Lackey’s shoulder from the edge of the right circle.</p>
<p class="p4">Harvard answered with a pair of power play goals later in the frame to send the teams into the third period deadlocked in a 2-2 tie. But the Bears quickly reclaimed the advantage four minutes into the final stanza when Josh McArdle ’18 scored on a one-timer in front of the net.</p>
<p class="p4">“They’ve got a good power play, so it wasn’t good by us to take those penalties, but I thought we were resilient,” Lafferty said. “We responded well.”</p>
<p class="p4">A minute and a half later, Lafferty capitalized on a power play, sending a wrist shot past Lackey from the slot to begin his three-goal streak.</p>
<p class="p4">Ryan Donato scored on a power play and brought the Crimson within one goal of the Bears midway through the period, but Lafferty added two goals — including one on a 5-on-3 power play — to secure the victory for Bruno.</p>
<p class="p4">“We just stuck with it, and we kept getting pucks to the net,” Lafferty said. “We were pretty opportunistic in the third.”</p>
<p class="p4">Ty Pelton-Byce scored when Harvard pulled Lackey for an extra skater with two minutes remaining, but the Bears fended off the Crimson attack to the buzzer.</p>
<p class="p4">Kania made 41 saves as the Bears were outshot by the Crimson 45-29.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Brown 3, Dartmouth 0</b></p>
<p class="p4">The following night, goals from three different Bears and a shutout performance from Kania in net fueled Bruno to a senior night sweep of the Big Green (13-14-2, 11-10-1). The victory marked Brown’s first shutout against Dartmouth since 1995.</p>
<p class="p4">After a scoreless first period, Tommy Marchin ’19 put the Bears on the board late in the second stanza with his team-high 11th goal of the season. Two minutes later, Charlie Corcoran ’18 knocked in a rebound from the left side of the net to widen the lead.</p>
<p class="p4">“We just stuck to our systems and kept getting pucks in deep,” Corcoran said. “It was good (that) the guys didn’t get frustrated, stayed with our systems and kept believing in what we do. When we play that way, I think we can play with anyone, and it worked out for us.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears capitalized on two Dartmouth penalties in the final period when Max Gottlieb ’19 converted on a power play with 40 seconds remaining. Gottlieb fired a shot from the point past goaltender Adrian Clark to clinch the win for Bruno.</p>
<p class="p4">Zach Giuttari ’20 assisted on all three goals in the contest.</p>
<p class="p4">The tenth-seeded Bears will open playoff competition in a best-of-three series at Princeton this weekend. The winner of the series will advance to the quarterfinal round, which will take place March<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>11 to 13.</p>
<p class="p4">In the leadup to Friday’s contest against the Tigers, Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94 emphasized the importance of playing with intensity and focus.</p>
<p class="p4">In “playoff hockey, you have to play with desperation every time you step on the ice, every shift,” Whittet said. “You have to understand that there’s going to be a price you have to pay if you’re going to be successful. The guys will be on top of it no matter where we are, and it’s just good to go into playoffs with a little bit of positive momentum.”</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno’s Ivy sweep marks the first time that the team has defeated the Crimson and Big Green in the same weekend series since the 2013-14 season. Closing out the regular season with this success is particularly meaningful for the graduating senior class, Whittet said.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s a good thing for the seniors to be rewarded for their work,” Whittet said. “They’re all good leaders in their own right, they’re good hockey players, they’re even better people and they want Brown hockey to do well. They’re selfless in what they do.”</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s pretty awesome,” Corcoran said. “We’re a really close group of guys, and we’re a really close team, so it was just really cool to close out like that.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears will open the first round of the ECAC Tournament at Princeton Friday. Face-off is at 7 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The men’s basketball team’s playoff chances took a major hit this weekend with losses to Columbia and Cornell on the road. Entering Friday’s contest against Columbia, the Bears, Lions, and Big Red were tied for the final playoff spot, but the losses put Bruno (11-14, 4-8 Ivy) in a tough position as it went into the final weekend of its season. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With the results, the Bears moved to a tie with Princeton for seventh place in the Ivy League. In order to earn a berth in the Ivy League Tournament, Bruno will have to defeat both Princeton and Penn, as well as hope for losses from Columbia and Cornell this weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We want to end the season with these home wins,” said Travis Fuller ’19. “We want to send out our (only) senior Jason Massey ’18 with a win.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 82, Columbia 89</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears suffered a heartbreaking loss at the hands of the Lions (8-17, 5-7), who were carried by efficient shooting to a close victory Friday. Brown started the game quickly and jumped out to an early 11-point lead twice in the first half. At one point, the Bears held a 28-19 advantage. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the wheels quickly fell off for Brown as Columbia’s shots started to fall while the Bears could not find the their way to the basket. The Lions went on a 14-point run, and Bruno went into halftime stunned, down 36-33. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the second half, the Bears were unable to find their stride and recover from Columbia’s strong scoring streak. The Lions widened the lead to 73-58, but Brown was not ready to go quietly. Bruno began to mount a comeback led by Brandon Anderson ’20 and Desmond Cambridge ’21 to swing momentum in its favor. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The run soon cut the Lions’ lead to 82-78 but was ultimately too little too late for the Bears. Columbia’s accurate shooting from the charity stripe, led by Mike Smith, downed Brown. Smith would finish with 23 points and a 13-14 mark from the free throw line.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cambridge finished the game leading all scorers with 26 points, followed by Anderson with 23. The Bears shot 39 percent from the field and recorded 12 assists. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 68, Cornell 73</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The following night, the Bears and Big Red (11-14, 5-7) kept the score close in the first half, as neither team could find an edge. Obi Okolie ’20 led the team off the bench with nine first-half points, but usual stars Anderson and Cambridge were quiet, combining for just five. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the break, guided by 11 points from Tamenang Choh ’21, Brown led Cornell 35-31. The team shot 34 percent from the field, compared to Cornell’s 33 percent, and recorded three steals. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the second period, the Bears began to heat up, jumping out to a 47-40 lead with 13 minutes remaining in the game. But Cornell, led by the clutch plays of Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof, took a 53-50 lead moments later. On their next two possessions, Matt Morgan hit a contested three-pointer and Abdur Ra’oof knocked in a thunderous dunk to extend Big Red’s lead to eight. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cornell’s run finally ended when Cambridge hit a three-pointer to trim the Cornell lead to five with six minutes to play. Choh and Cambridge were both fouled on strong drives to the basket, and both knocked in their shots at the charity stripe to bring Bruno within two. Chris Sullivan ’19 sunk an and-one layup on an impressive assist from Anderson and knocked in the free throw to put the Bears ahead 64-63.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno and Big Red continued to trade blows as the game came down to the wire, but a basket from Steven Julian extended the Cornell lead to three. A miscommunication resulting from Big Red’s strong defense forced a turnover, but Cornell could not capitalize. Anderson was fouled but only could make one free throw. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears fouled Big Red moments later, and Jack Gordon made both of his free throws to widen the lead to four and put the game out of reach for Bruno. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Choh led all Brown scorers with 17 points followed by Okolie, who notched 15. The Bears finished with a 34 percent field goal percentage and grabbed 49 rebounds. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“My biggest takeaway is how much we competed and the seriousness to how we approached the game,” Fuller said. “This is a fun group to be around because we are consistently making each other better.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will return to the Pizzitola Center to close out the regular season against Princeton Friday and Penn Saturday. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">While uncharacteristic mistakes on the uneven bars and balance beam hindered the gymnastics team’s run for the Ivy Classic title, the Bears still recorded their second highest score of the season with a 192.975 at the Pizzitola Sports Center Sunday. Yale posted a 195.025 to capture the crown, followed by Cornell and Penn, respectively.</p>
<p class="p2">2018 marks the first time Brown hosted the Classic since Bruno won the trophy at home in 2014. Though the Bears weren’t able to duplicate the feat Sunday, seven gymnasts were awarded All-Ivy Classic Honors.</p>
<p class="p2">Julia Green ’19 received First Team recognition on vault and Second Team on floor. Anya Barca-Hall ’18 earned First Team honors on floor while Regan Butchness ’18 claimed First Team accolades on balance beam. Gabrielle Hechtman ’19 and Alyssa Gardner ’21 nabbed Second Team on vault and Anya Olson ’18 and co-captain Claire Ryan ’18 finished with Second Team laurels on bars.</p>
<p class="p2">In addition to the All-Ivy Honors, Head Coach Sara Carver-Milne noted positive elements of the team’s overall performance.</p>
<p class="p2">“They performed probably the best that they have all season in some areas, especially on floor and vault, and that’s all we can ask of them,” Carver-Milne said.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears opened the competition with their strongest event, the uneven bars. But against Ivy rivals, nerves crept into the lineup, resulting in multiple errors.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s a very, very intense, competitive meet,” Carver-Milne said, adding that “the team handled the pressure really well throughout.” Though she noted the team’s final score was hurt by a few early mistakes, the team responded to errors well and came back strong.</p>
<p class="p2">After a shaky lead-off performance, Caroline Warren ’21 posted a 9.500 in the second spot to get Brown back on track. Ryan and Olson added a pair of 9.750s in the middle of the lineup, and Emma Hansen ’21 capped off a unique routine with a stuck double back tuck dismount to earn a 9.675.</p>
<p class="p2">Though bars is usually the Bears’ strongest event, “I think they got a little bit ahead of themselves, just a little too into the moment and the excitement of it being Ivies,” Carver-Milne said.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears shook off their extra excitement quickly as they took to the beam for their second rotation. Ryan gave her team a solid 9.575 to build on, and Green followed with a 9.525. Cassidy Jung ’19 demonstrated unshakeable composure in the third spot, earning a 9.625 for her stellar leaps and a flawless back handspring step-out layout step-out series. Later, Hansen nailed an identical acro series for a 9.575. In the anchor spot, Butchness left little room for deduction as she stuck her side aerial to full-twisting layout dismount perfectly, notching a 9.775 and finishing in third place overall.</p>
<p class="p2">Halfway through the competition, Bruno trailed third place by 0.75 and had little to lose going into floor.</p>
<p class="p2">“We just tried to focus on each other, focus on ourselves,” Barca-Hall said. “We knew we couldn’t control scoring. We couldn’t control what other teams were doing. We could only control what we were doing.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears put on a show in the third rotation as all six gymnasts in the floor lineup scored 9.650 or better to achieve a season-high 48.850. Hansen hit her third routine of the night to earn a career-best 9.725, and Diana Manzano ’20 contributed to the team total by tying Hansen’s score to up her own career-high. A sky-high double back pike earned Green a personal-best 9.825, and Barca-Hall closed out the event with a 9.875 to raise her career-high and claim second place.</p>
<p class="p2">In its final event of the Classic, Brown notched a season-high 48.225. Green led the team on vault with a career-best 9.775 and finished in second overall. Anne Christman ’20 earned a 9.575 in the leadoff spot, and Gardner and Hechtman supported with twin 9.675s to bring up the final 192.975.</p>
<p class="p2">“It wasn’t our best, but it’s kind of motivating because we know that we still had some really great scores today,” Barca-Hall said. She added that with recent experience in high-stakes competition, she knows the team can compete under pressure.”We’re just waiting to show it, and we have some good opportunities to prove it at ECACs and at some of the meets coming up.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears will stay at home as they host the University of Bridgeport, the College at Brockport and Southern Connecticut State University Sunday. The quad meet is Brown’s final home competition of the season and will begin at 1 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brownsword ’18: On and off the court, NCAA plagued by scandals and mediocre performances</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 2017-18 college basketball season has been really, really bad. It started with the dismissal of long-time Louisville Head Coach Rick Pitino after a scandal that involved the basketball program overseeing meetings between prospective players and prostitutes. Then Michigan State’s Tom Izzo was wrapped up in the cover-up of sexual assault by players in the men’s basketball program. The latest bombshell — incomplete results of an FBI investigation into corruption in the NCAA — was that over 20 programs are accused of paying over five figures to prospects. The accusations are directed at top programs like Duke, North Carolina and Michigan State — and Arizona’s head coach Sean Miller is accused of discussing a $100,000 payment to projected NBA superstar DeAndre Ayton. Louisville’s punishment for the Pitino scandal resulted in four years of vacated wins, including the 2013 NCAA championship. Throwing aside the legitimate arguments for paying collegiate athletes,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the incoming sanctions make one wonder how much of the recent college basketball past will be erased.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the 2017-18 season hasn’t just been bad because of the myriad off-court issues: On the court, this year has been an aberration of mediocre play across the board. Projections of the NCAA tournament have proven fruitless because every team — no matter how good it appears — is losing to inferior competition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last year’s runner-up, Villanova, got off to an incredible start to the year — as always — but has recently stumbled with three losses to unranked Big East opposition. Kansas and Gonzaga, two top 10 teams this year and last, both have more losses already this season than in 2016-17. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Duke — with two NBA-bound big men — has lost three games to unranked teams that are currently slated to miss the NCAA tournament altogether. The defending champion and my beloved North Carolina Tar Heels lost to mid-major Wofford at home as a double-digit favorite. With two games, conference tournaments and the NCAA tournament left in the season, UNC has the same amount of losses as it did all of last year. Both Carolina teams suffered defeats to unranked ACC opponents midweek before facing off against each other this weekend. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And it’s not just the top teams that are performing below par: The Power 5 conference programs competing for a spot in the NCAA tournament are well below previous years’ standards. For example, ESPN currently projects Baylor, which is currently 18-12, to be an 11-seed. Last year’s 11-seeds — which are typically the last at-large bids to be awarded — were 24-9 Rhode Island, 20-13 Kansas State, 19-13 Wake Forest, 21-13 Xavier, 24-9 USC and 20-12 Providence. Unless the Bears defeat tournament-bound (as of right now, who knows what could change next?) Kansas State, they will have at least as many regular season losses as last year’s worst qualifying team.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Baylor beat Oklahoma earlier this week to further advance its tournament resume. The Sooners are their own special case: Another projected top NBA draft pick, Trae Young, led the Sooners to an exceptional start with wins over No. 6 Texas Tech and No. 13 Wichita State. But after a four-game losing streak, a top 10 team earlier in the season has slipped to the edge of tournament relevancy — projected as a 10-seed right now. Oklahoma had spent multiple weeks this season as a top 10 team and are now in danger of missing the NCAA tournament altogether. Arizona State and West Virginia join the list of former top 10 teams that are now outside the top 20 looking in. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These stories are not exceptions: Parity is the name of the game this year. No. 3 Michigan State was down 30 to unranked Northwestern before coming back to win two weekends ago. St. John’s hadn’t won a conference game all season before beating No. 3 Villanova and No. 5 Duke in back-to-back games.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even mid-major powers like Gonzaga, Wichita State and Saint Mary’s are finding it hard to run their conferences like expected. More secondary and tertiary mid-majors are joining the top tiers of this year’s rankings, as traditional powers across the board are losing week in and week out.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whether it’s a statement about the spread-out quality of the players and teams or a regression to the mean for everybody, this season of college basketball has been hard to watch for a fan of any team. No game can be taken for granted, and even the top programs can lose to the weakest of opposition. With the conference tournaments upcoming, who knows where the dust will settle when the brackets are being decided. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It should make for an interesting 2018 NCAA tournament: Hopefully, 10 years from now, awfter the scandal dust settles, we’ll find out who won.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jason Katz ’19 only needed one attempt to win the long jump at the Ivy League Heptagonal Indoor Track and Field Championships. Going into the event, Katz was the top seed, and on his first effort, he set the mark that his competitors would chase for the rest of the competition. But he wasn’t satisfied with merely besting the rest of the league with one leap. On his final long jump attempt, Katz said he “popped off about four or five inches farther” than his first jump,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he said, securing a personal record of 24-08.50 and solidifying a spot in program history as the second best mark at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Katz wrapped up his performance at the championships with a run for the triple jump title, facing off against an athlete from Dartmouth after the event came down to a tiebreaker. Katz notched a 15.57 jump on his final attempt to match the first-place mark but fell short of overtaking his competitor when the two jumped once more to decide the winner. Still, his 51-01.00 was a career-long for the indoor triple jump and the third best all-time at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For his achievements at the Ivy League Indoor Track and Field Championships, Katz was recognized as Field Performer of the Meet, received Brown University Athletics Student-Athlete of the Week honors and has been selected as The Herald’s Athlete of the Week. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Herald: Congratulations on an amazing performance at Ivies! How did your teammates and coaches react to the win and the tiebreaker? </b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Katz: I think most of my teammates thought I had won with that jump because (the Dartmouth athlete) was the first jumper in preliminaries, and after he jumped (15.57) on his first jump, I don’t think they put that up on the board. So none of the people knew that he had jumped that exact same number. They thought I had won; although I kind of knew. … They were really happy. They would have been really happy either way though. They were screaming and everything in the crowd. Coach (Ken Hunt) was pretty happy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How did Heps affect the team’s mentality going into the remainder of the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s definitely a confidence boost for a lot of the men, seeing what we can do and what more there is to gain. Especially for the freshmen who have never competed — definitely some experience that they’ll be able to draw on for competing at the next Heps afterwards. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How did you first get into track and field?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I started freshman year of high school. I had always been that fast kid. I played all the sports as a kid — soccer, basketball, baseball. So I was always fast. In the springtime, since soccer is a fall sport and basketball is a winter sport, I needed something to do. I actually didn’t want to do track, but my parents convinced me to. I just fell in love with it at the beginning of freshman year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Between the triple jump and long jump, which event is your favorite? </b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Triple jump is definitely my favorite. It’s the one I’m better at. Actually, I only really started doing the long jump at the end of last year. In high school, I was okay at long jump (but) nothing special. Freshman year, although I just wanted to do triple jump, Coach made me do long jump. … I didn’t long jump again until the end of sophomore year at the end of outdoor season when I jumped a two-foot PR. … Pretty recently, I’ve started to enjoy long jump a little more not only because I’m excelling in it, but because it is kind of fun when you actually figure out how to jump. But triple jump is still a lot closer to my heart. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What is your pre-meet routine?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I don’t do anything crazy superstitious or whatnot. I always do the same specific stuff for the warm-up. I guess what most people would say I am known for is how I compete. I’m always the one with my hood up, listening to my music, 100 percent in the zone. Everyone knows that you can’t even get a word with me when I’m in the zone. Especially how I always make very serious, interesting faces when I’m kinda doing that. I’d say my favorite pump-up song is “The Pretender” by the Foo Fighters. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What’s been the highlight of your athletic career at Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If I had to go with a specific moment, it was last year (when) we went down to Rider (University) for a meet outdoors. At the time, there was me and another triple jumper, … Taylor Alarcon, … and throughout the whole year we had been competing, going back and forth. Freshman year I was never able to catch him. Then last year, he got injured in one of our first meets, and I was building up while he was injured. At that meet, we had both been jumping pretty well. We were going back and forth. … He finally hit (50 feet) for the first time at that meet, and then I had some good jumps. … We kind of chirped back and forth at each other like “What are you going to do next?” On my last jump, I popped off a two-foot PR, and I just really hit it solid. … All the crowd was into it. All the jumpers were into it. That was probably my favorite moment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What are your goals for the rest of the season? The team’s goals?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I never want to put a number on things, but I’d say stay healthy, stay competitive. Do what I need to do and jump farther. Win the meets I need to win and make it far into the season in terms of NCAAs. Team goals are definitely to improve. … We left some points out there, but I think overall we did pretty well at indoors. We have to repeat and try to improve outdoors.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The women’s basketball team held their final home stand of the season this weekend. The Bears (15-10, 3-9 Ivy) fell to Columbia Saturday but notched a big win over Cornell the following day.</p>
<p class="p2">In the first matchup, the Lions (8-19, 2-10) jumped out to an early lead and held onto it throughout the game, outscoring Bruno in every quarter to earn a final score of 90-74. The Bears shot well, tallying 27 makes on 64 attempts, but it was not strong enough to overcome Columbia’s 35 for 70 shooting performance.</p>
<p class="p2">Consistent scorers Shayna Mehta ’19 and Justine Gaziano ’20 were the only players for Brown to score in double digits, posting 22 and 20 points apiece.</p>
<p class="p2">The Lions were aggressive in the paint, and it helped translate to a win. In addition to posting 36 points down low to Brown’s 28, Columbia out-rebounded Bruno 43 to 32. Even the Bears’ best rebounders were stifled — no player collected more than five boards.</p>
<p class="p2">On Sunday, friends and family filled the Pizzitola Sports Center to celebrate the careers and witness the final home game of Bruno seniors Megan Reilly ’18 and Janie White ’18. Team manager Oliver Fox ’18 was also honored.</p>
<p class="p2">“Playing for this program for the past four years has been an absolute honor. I’ve grown so much as a person and leader, and I’m extremely grateful for my Brown basketball family,” Reilly said.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears cruised to a comfortable victory, defeating the Big Red (6-19, 2-10) 85-59.</p>
<p class="p2">Once again, Gaziano and Mehta led scoring, putting up 30 and 28, respectively. Combined, the two converted on eight of nine three-point attempts.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears dominated in all aspects of the game, finishing at the basket easily and shutting down the Big Red’s scoring opportunities with lockdown defense. Cornell often passed the ball around the court looking for an open shot before the dwindling shot clock forced a player to take a heavily contested attempt. The Big Red was limited to making just 17 of 65 field goal attempts.</p>
<p class="p2">The big win gave the Bears’ seniors a memorable note for their last game at home.</p>
<p class="p2">“I have so many incredible memories on this court, so when I look back on my senior night, I’m happy that I’ll remember such a great win. My teammates did an amazing job making the day feel so special and memorable,” Reilly said.</p>
<p class="p2">“I can’t believe how fast my four years went, so my biggest piece of advice would be to enjoy every minute of it,” Reilly added.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears will close out their season with visits to Princeton March 2 and Penn March 3.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Last weekend, the men’s and women’s track and field teams traveled north to Dartmouth to participate in the Ivy League Indoor Heptagonal Championships. Hanover was kind to the Bears, as Bruno captured two individual titles on the men’s side and one on the women’s. The men’s final team total of 85 points ranked them third behind Princeton and Penn, while the women scored 47 points to finish seventh overall.</p>
<p class="p4">Co-captain Tosin Oyewole ’18 was particularly pleased with the performance of the men’s team, which finished in last place at the meet in 2017. “We’re definitely on the come-up,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Jason Katz ’19 was a major contributor to Brown’s success at the meet. The junior sprung into action on the first day of competition, soaring to a 24-feet, 8.5-inch victory in the long jump, before finishing in second place in the triple jump Sunday. The eight Ivy League head coaches unanimously elected Katz the Male Outstanding Field Athlete of the Meet in acknowledgment of his dominance in the horizontal jumps.</p>
<p class="p4">The 500-meter run was another point of strength for Bruno. Co-captain Zack Emrich ’18 nabbed a third consecutive win in the race with a time of 1:02.85<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>while Max Haensel ’18 followed hot on his heels in second place. Of his three Ivy 500-meter titles, Emrich said that this crown meant the most to him because he was able to share it with his friend and training partner Haensel.</p>
<p class="p4">At last year’s meet, Haensel sustained a freak injury that robbed the two of a satisfying finish. “Going into the final last year, Max and I just looked at each other on the warm-up and I was like, ‘Let’s get it. You’re gonna go one and I’m gonna go two,’” Emrich said. “Unfortunately, he ended up breaking his leg in the race and had to take some time off.”</p>
<p class="p4">This year, however, was different. “It was a magical moment when we both crossed the line. We turned around and hugged each other. It’s what I’ve been waiting for for four years — a really incredible experience,” Emrich said.</p>
<p class="p4">Emrich’s fellow team captains also shone brightly. Oyewole rebounded from a lower back injury to snag second in the 400-meter, and Owen Russell ’19 heaved his way to a runner-up finish in the weight throw. Russell’s performance was especially notable as his mark of 70-feet, 2.25-inches smashed Timothy Bruno’s ’80 indoor school record by more than four feet.</p>
<p class="p4">Middle-distance man Zac Lanigan ’20 earned two more second-place finishes in the team effort. The sophomore started by earning runner-up honors in the 1,000 meters, then joined forces with Oyewole, Emrich and Martin Martinez ’18 on Brown’s distance medley relay squad, which crossed the line trailing only Princeton.</p>
<p class="p4">On the women’s side, Carly Paul ’19 worked overtime to rack up 17 points for the Bears — roughly 40 percent of her team’s total score. Between the five events that comprise the pentathlon and her two additional open events, Paul competed for the Bears on seven separate occasions over the course of the weekend. Paul’s stamina paid dividends: She won the pentathlon with a personal best of 4,013 points (the second-best score in Brown history), tied for third in the open high jump and took fifth in the open long jump.</p>
<p class="p4">Harvard’s Zoe Hughes — the reigning Ivy League pentathlon and heptathlon champion — forced Paul to sweat her way to victory in the multi competition. Though Paul established a sizable lead over her rival during the first two events of the pentathlon, Hughes’ strong showing in the shot put reduced the difference to a thin margin of just 21 points.</p>
<p class="p4">“That’s pretty down to the wire,” Paul said. “I knew that (Hughes) would close the gap a little, but she definitely closed the gap more than I expected.”</p>
<p class="p4">Paul proved stronger in the long jump, beating Hughes by four inches and increasing her lead to 51 points. “That was huge,” Paul said, “because if she had stayed within 20 (points), she would have had to beat me by two seconds in the (800 meters), which is actually feasible.”</p>
<p class="p4">Ultimately, Paul finished far enough ahead of Hughes in the 800 meters to secure gold. “I knew I just had to stay on her heels and basically not let her get away from me,” Paul said.</p>
<p class="p4">Other top performers for the Brown women included Zion Lewis ’20 and Megan Ratcliffe ’18. Lewis acquitted herself well both on the track and in the field, claiming second place in the triple jump and third in the 60-meter dash. On the other end of the distance spectrum, Ratcliffe clocked a personal best of 16:27.39 to finish second in the 5,000 meters.</p>
<p class="p4">Sunday evening brought more good news for Bruno, as the men’s DMR team learned that they had qualified for the NCAA Indoor National Championships.</p>
<p class="p4">Entering the weekend, Brown’s DMR team of Lanigan, Oyewole, Emrich and Martinez was ranked twelfth nationally, teetering on the edge of qualification for the championships. The quartet waited anxiously to see if any team would displace them from the pool of 12 national invitees before the qualifying window closed Feb. 25.</p>
<p class="p4">Princeton’s DMR made a bid to bump the Bears out of the top 12 at the Ivy League Championships but fell short of the requisite time by about 10 seconds. The Tigers’ anchor, Billy Paulson ’18, slammed his baton on the ground in disgust after their attempt fizzled. “All the Princeton guys were coming up to us afterwards and congratulating us on going to nationals,” Emrich said.</p>
<p class="p4">Once the results of the Southeastern Conference Championships — the last meet of the weekend — appeared online at 9 p.m., Bruno’s fate became official. No team in the country had beaten Brown’s DMR time before the end of the qualifying period; as a result, the Bears could punch their tickets to Texas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p class="p4">“We’re flying out to Texas on Thursday (March 8),” Emrich said. “It’s crazy. What a way to cap off our senior years.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears’ DMR will return to the track March 9 at the NCAA Indoor National Championships hosted by Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This weekend, the men’s basketball team dropped home contests to Princeton 78-63 and Penn 99-93 to close out its season. The Bears lost their sixth straight game and finished the year ranked seventh in the Ivy League with a 4-10 conference record.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our guys realize that there is a bigger picture,” said Head Coach Mike Martin ’04. “We’re trying to build our program with a lot of freshmen and sophomores and one senior. So I think that every time you have the opportunity to compete, you should appreciate that opportunity.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Penn’s victory has given them a significant postseason berth, as they are now tied with Harvard for the number one seed in the Ivy League Tournament later this month. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Following this weekend’s results, Yale and Cornell will also make appearances in the tournament. Bruno was in striking distance of postseason competition for weeks, but cold shooting down the stretch ultimately put the Bears (11-16, 4-10 Ivy) out of contention. With a young and athletic core group of players, Brown is poised to compete for a spot in the tournament in future seasons. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 63, Princeton 78</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears and the Tigers (13-16, 5-9) jumped out of the locker room to play consistent offense in the first half. At first, the score was tight, but three straight treys from Princeton gave the Tigers a 20-14 advantage. Princeton started the contest by shooting 4-8 from beyond the arc while Bruno shot just 1-5 during this span. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the half, Princeton led 32-25. The Bears shot just 31 percent from the field and 14 percent from three-point range in the opening period and recorded 23 rebounds and three blocks. Obi Okolie ’19 and Joshua Howard ’20 led Bruno with six points each.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re going through a difficult stretch,” Martin said. “Sometimes the ball goes in, and sometimes it doesn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To open the second stanza, the Tigers went on a quick 9-1 scoring run to extend their advantage to 15. After two three-point shots from Devin Cannady, Princeton’s lead quickly widened to 18 points. Cannady scored 12 points in the first seven minutes of the period and finished the game with 16. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears began to drive to the basket and play strong defense in an attempt to fend off the Princeton scoring attack. Okolie was fouled and drained both of his free throws to bring the Bears within 12 points of the Tigers with just over nine minutes to play. Moments later, Okolie sunk a three-point shot and Zach Hunsaker ’20 knocked in two free throws to trim the Tigers’ lead to nine.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But a three-point shot from Jerome Desrosiers stunted Brown’s run, and the Bears were unable to fight their way back into the game. Myles Stephens fueled Princeton’s 15-point victory by scoring 22 points for the Tigers. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We missed some shots,” Martin said. “How many did you see, in the second half, that the ball just sat on the rim and rolled out on our end?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno shot 34 percent from the field in comparison to Princeton’s 46 percent. Okolie led all Brown scorers with 17 points and nine rebounds, while the team grabbed 44 rebounds and committed 11 turnovers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think we can do a better job at the things we can control,” Martin said. “At the end of the day we want to overcome all of that stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 93, Penn 99</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Quakers (22-8, 12-2) came out hot beyond the arc from the opening tip. Ryan Betley hit three treys to give Penn an early edge. Betley’s fourth three-pointer of the half gave Penn a nine point lead, while the Bears had made just one three up to that point. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno was unable to find open shots for most of the first period and could not claw its way back. At halftime, Penn led Brown 47-31. The Bears shot 41 percent in the first half and 1-9 from beyond the arc, compared to the Quakers’ 55 percent and 7-9 mark from three-point range.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Tamenang Choh ’21 led all Brown scorers with eight points, followed by Hunsaker with seven. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“They were hard for us to guard all night long,” Martin said. “We had just enough droughts offensively that we dug ourselves too big of a hole.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the second stanza, the Bears could not overcome their deficit and fight back into contention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although a late steal and three-point shot from Desmond Cambridge ’21 helped the Bears trim the Quakers’ lead in the final two minutes, Penn managed to stave off the Brown attack. The Quakers stayed red-hot from three-point range and continued to be led by the shooting of Betley, who finished with 30 points.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m most happy that the guys kept playing,” Martin said. “They didn’t stop until the horn sounded off at the end.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Choh finished with 23 points and nine rebounds, followed by Brandon Anderson ’20, who also notched 23 points. The team shot 49 percent from the field and 32 percent from beyond the arc. Brown also grabbed 34 rebounds and recorded 40 points in the paint.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Coming off an unexpected fourth-place finish at the Ivy Classics last weekend, the gymnastics team bounced back with a second-place finish in its final home meet of the season Sunday. The Bears tallied a 193.150 team score to beat Southern Connecticut State University and the College at Brockport but fall to the University of Bridgeport.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This was a complete 180 from Ivies,” said co-captain Maggie McAvoy ’18. “We came in with the mindset of having fun because at Ivies we got a little nervous, got a little ahead of ourselves and rushed everything, but this time we were just taking it slow, having fun and enjoying ourselves. We were on for all four events.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the team’s five seniors, the quad meet was their last time performing in the Pizzitola Sports Center. After the competition, the veterans were recognized for their dedication and contributions to the program.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s very bittersweet,” said co-captain Claire Ryan ’18. “I remember my freshman year Senior Day and thinking it was forever away, but now it’s here. It’s been such a special experience the last four years, and I couldn’t have asked for a more positive time here.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown kicked off the meet on vault, where the Bears made some lineup changes from their last showing. Kate Nelson ’21 made her first appearance on the event, notching a 9.500 in the leadoff spot while Gabrielle Hechtman ’19 and Anne Christman ’20 followed with matching scores of 9.575. In the anchor position, Julia Green ’19 earned a 9.725 for her front handspring front pike to close the first rotation. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno was trailing all three visiting teams going into uneven bars, but the team put up big numbers on its second event to make up some ground. Alyssa Gardner ’21 got the momentum swinging with a stuck double back tuck dismount, earning a 9.575. Erin Howell ’20 came off a shoulder injury to make her season debut with a solid 9.675, and Ryan matched her career-high 9.800. Anya Olson ’18 contributed a 9.750, and Emma Hansen ’21 nailed her double back tuck dismount to receive a 9.825. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Halfway through the meet, Brown sat in second behind Bridgeport. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A fall early in the balance beam lineup added pressure on the remaining gymnasts, but the Bears pulled off five hit routines to stay on pace with the Knights. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If somebody falls, we’ve kind of got to hit that reset button and just pick it back up,” Ryan said. “We’ve gotten really, really good at doing that … and it definitely showed in the meet today.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the leadoff spot, Ryan posted a 9.550, and freshman Rose Domonoske ’21 showed veteran composure in the middle of the lineup, earning a 9.675 for a bobble-free routine. Hansen hit a perfect back handspring step-out layout step-out series for a 9.525, and beam specialist Regan Butchness ’18 capped off the rotation with a stuck dismount and a 9.725. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A 47.925 on balance beam secured Bruno’s second-place standing going into the final rotation. Still chasing Bridgeport, the Bears had a slate of strong performances on floor exercise to notch a 48.750.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I don’t think there was (pressure),” McAvoy said of the team’s mentality going into the last event. “We did amazing on floor last week, and we were just going to repeat the same thing.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">McAvoy overcame an elbow injury to return to the lineup, giving her team a 9.725 to build on. Christman and Green added twin 9.775s to tie their personal bests, and Anya Barca-Hall ’18 notched a 9.825 in the final performance of the meet. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The 193.150 is Bruno’s second-highest mark this season and puts the team in a good position as it tries to qualify for the USAG Collegiate National Championships. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This (score) helps so much,” McAvoy said. “(Regional qualifying scores) can still change drastically. We have three meets left, and I just got word that we finished at the top of the Ivies for this weekend. It’s only going to help us.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the Bears turn their attention to a quad meet against Yale, the University of Kentucky and the University of New Hampshire, Ryan added that she felt the team’s performance on Sunday was a good indicator of how the rest of the season will pan out. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It is really, really going to help us with our confidence going forward,” Ryan said. “Obviously Ivies didn’t go exactly how we wanted it, and we needed a meet like this to pick it up. We still have a lot of our season left and a lot of ground to make, and we definitely still can.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown will take to the floor at 1 p.m. in New Hampshire Sunday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following a close overtime loss to Quinnipiac University and a decisive victory over Stony Brook University, the men’s lacrosse team hoped for a strong showing in its home opener against No. 15 Rutgers University (4-1) Saturday. Despite claiming an early lead, the Bears (1-2) fell to the Scarlet Knights 10-8. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rutgers opened scoring in the first minute, but Brown responded strongly. Goals from Jack Kniffin ’20, Luke McCaleb ’20 and Brian Prigmore ’19 gave Bruno a 4-1 lead midway through the first quarter. Rutgers found the net once more with just over five minutes left in the first. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Outscored 5-1 in the second quarter, Bruno struggled to keep pace with the Knights. Prigmore scored the lone Brown goal — his second of the afternoon — in the second stanza, and the Bears entered halftime trailing Rutgers 7-5. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Michael Panepinto ’19 opened scoring in the second half by posting a goal nine minutes into the third quarter. But Brown’s offense stalled for the rest of the frame and put up only three shots to Rutgers’ eight. Rutgers tallied a goal with 7:04 left in the period and entered the fourth quarter at an 8-6 advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Panepinto scored again early in the fourth to put the Bears within one goal of the Scarlet Knights, but Rutgers responded with back-to-back points to widen their lead to three with 4:50 left to play. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Carson Song ’19 posted a goal in the last two minutes of the matchup, but time ultimately ran out for the Bears as the game ended 10-8, giving Brown its second loss of the season against a competitive Rutgers team. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our kids battled hard and I was proud of that, but I’m definitely looking for a little more consistency,” said Brown Head Coach Mike Daly. “Against a good team they’ve got talent everywhere, but so do we … We expect our guys to win those matchups and make the plays they’re capable of.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The silver lining of the game was the exceptional play of goalie Phil Goss ’20, who logged 20 saves and kept the game within reach for the Bears. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We need to do a better job protecting (Goss) and giving him a chance, because when we do he makes the plays that we need,” Daly said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears have a quick turnaround this week as they travel to play an undefeated No. 7 Villanova University (5-0) squad Tuesday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: How to fix college basketball</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/05/klein-20how-fix-college-basketball/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sports world erupted last weekend when FBI documents revealed deep corruption in college basketball. Several storied programs — including those at Duke University, University of North Carolina and the University of Kentucky — gave cash benefits to recruits to entice talented players. Though some of these benefits were minor, there were also substantial offenses, including at the University of Arizona, where coach Sean Miller was caught discussing a $100,000 payment for star DeAndre Ayton’s services. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My only question: Why is everyone in college basketball acting so outraged and saddened? Let’s be honest: everybody knows that top recruits are receiving money. And those players deserve the money, too. The college basketball system is broken and filled with incomprehensible rules. Don’t get me wrong — I love college basketball. But I think we all can admit that the sport needs fixing fast. Here’s how I would go about it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>1. Allow college players to make money off their own names. </b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The NCAA does not let athletes profit from their likenesses and autographs. The organization has maintained that players are students first and that they must retain their amateur status. Well, I’m a student too, and if anyone was willing to pay for my autograph, I would sign everything in sight. Players, and especially national stars, should not be as limited as I am, considering they produce tons of revenue for schools and the NCAA itself thanks to TV contracts and merchandise. Head Coach of the Kentucky Wildcats John Calipari is a controversial figure to be sure, but is absolutely correct when he says, “It’s their name and likeness. It’s not ours, it’s theirs.” As adults, college athletes should be able to use their images in whatever manner they choose. Are members of Final Four teams who play in front of full football stadiums not mature enough to represent their own brand? Ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>2. Get rid of the one-and-done rule.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There has been a lot of conversations about changing this regulation. Top high school basketball players should not be forced to attend college, especially when they won’t gain anything from the experience. Ben Simmons did not need the experience of leading LSU to the NIT alongside a bunch of lesser players. He was NBA-ready from the moment he stepped on a college court. A common argument against removal of one-and-done is that players could get lost in the draft and lose their college eligibility. Why not allow high school graduates to enter the draft for a period, then remove their candidacy if their draft stock is not satisfactory?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another argument is that high school prospects are simply not prepared for the NBA life and will be busts like Kwame Brown, who is widely mocked for his NBA failures. Well, Kwame Brown played in the NBA for 13 seasons and earned just under $64 million in career earnings. Where do I sign up to be a $64 million bust? Out of the 44 men who were drafted out of high school, 32 became solid NBA players — that list includes Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Amar’e Stoudemire, LeBron James and Dwight Howard. Not too shabby. Somehow, Kobe and LeBron were able to hold their own against NBA players without a year at college.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"><b>3. Build-up the G League as another option. </b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The NBA is heading in this direction, too. I think it is clear that no upper-echelon prospect like DeAndre Ayton or Marvin Bagely is going to choose the Maine Red Claws over the NBA or a top college program. But guys who are just below that mark and want to improve their NBA draft stock should be able to pursue basketball as their sole focus, without the forced, time-consuming distractions of classes and other college responsibilities. Take Duke’s Trevon Duval, for example. He has underperformed on the court at times and is not projected to be a lottery pick. If, hypothetically, he wants basketball to become his full-time job but does not want to enter the NBA draft yet, he should have another viable option besides returning to Duke. An expanded (and better paying) G-League would allow players to work alongside NBA coaching talent and adjust to the NBA game more gradually.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The influx of superior players would drive up attendance for G League games, and the league would truly be off and running.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">With these three rules, I have removed all the players who don’t want to be in college and have given athletes their rightful compensation. Top college teams could play together for longer without the interruption of one-and-dones, and the quality of play would improve accordingly. Players would get to know each other’s tendencies, and rivalries like Duke and UNC would ramp up even further as starting lineups play against each other year after year. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">And best of all, we don’t have to act surprised when DeAndre Ayton makes some money.</span></p>

		<title>LaFragola ’19 wins second NCAA bid</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Last year, CJ LaFragola ’19 had to wait to receive an at-large bid to the 2017 NCAA Championships. This year, that wasn’t a problem, as his fifth place finish in the 184-pound weight class at the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Championships secured him an automatic bid to the tournament.</p>
<p class="p4">LaFragola will be joined at the championships with teammates Justin Staudenmayer ’18 and Jon Viruet ’19. Over the next week, the trio will make small adjustments as they prepare to go head to head against the best wrestlers in the NCAA.</p>
<p class="p4">For his accomplishments, LaFragola has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Herald: Congrats on a strong performance at EIWAs and qualifying for the NCAA championships once again. How does it feel?</b></p>
<p class="p4">LaFragola: It’s an awesome feeling. Last year, I didn’t qualify at the EIWA tournament — I got an at-large bid. So it was a great feeling to punch my ticket at the tournament this year by placing. … It’s going to be the second time around, so I kind of know what to expect. It won’t be a total shock going out there on the big stage.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>How does qualifying for NCAAs work?</b></p>
<p class="p4">It depends on your conference. We’re pretty fortunate. The EIWA invites a certain number of wrestlers per weight class, and in my weight class, the top seven finishers at the tournament got sent to nationals. Some other conferences may have fewer spots to give. I got fifth, so I was able to punch my ticket.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What do you feel is your strongest quality in competition? </b></p>
<p class="p4">I might not be the most technical wrestler, but I feel like I’m pretty physical and I just bring hard work. It might not always go your way, you might get taken down early, for instance, but I feel like I keep my head on straight and I keep grinding out the match. I just try to outwork the guy. That’s the number one goal. If you keep attacking and keep working, usually things go well.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What are you hoping to achieve at NCAAs?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Obviously, the ultimate goal is to get up on that podium. I always shoot for the stars, because who knows? People knock people off all the time. I may not have the highest seed going in, but the goal is be on top of that podium. You just have to work hard each match. You don’t have to beat the whole field at the tournament, you just have to beat the guy in front of you. That’s how it starts. The brackets will come out today, so I’ll know who my first guy is.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>How are you training in the next week to prepare for NCAAs?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Well, we always say the hay’s in the barn already. That’s what we’ve been saying all year. We just have to stay fresh and tweak a couple of things from conference. We watch a lot of film, just adjusting little things here and there technique-wise. We’re going to probably hit it kind of hard today and the next few days and taper down next week until the tournament day. Just make sure I’m making weight, staying healthy and staying fresh. … Usually, whoever is the most healthy gets a big advantage, because a lot of kids are banged up at this time.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>This is the first time Brown Wrestling is sending three wrestlers to NCAAs in 10 years. How does that feel?</b></p>
<p class="p4">It’s really awesome. Last year, I was fortunate enough to make it there, but I was riding solo. So it’s nice to have some of my guys with me. It’s really nice when you have a couple guys out there because, typically, you have your whole team at competitions and you can feed off of each other’s energy. So those two guys get to go before me, because they’re lighter, and if they do well, it helps build my confidence.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What have been your biggest goals for wrestling since coming to Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Team-wise, we always want to win the Ivy’s or place high in the conference, so it’s pretty cool that we placed second this year as a team. And everybody wants to be an All-American, and now I’m beginning to believe in that goal a little more, so it’s pretty cool. There’s an opportunity now. I’m at the national tournament, so there’s a chance I could do it.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>What are your plans for life after Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I’m not really sure. I’m studying (Business, Entrepreneurship and Organizations) right now, so something in business. Maybe if I’m feeling crazy, I’ll do something with sports. I don’t know if I’m UFC ready, though. But something in business, maybe marketing or design. I really like designing stuff, believe it or not. I’ve been drawing on shoes and whatnot. That’s kind of my thing, just as a thing I do on the side.</p>
<p class="p4">LaFragola is slated to take on 14th seed Nick Gravina of Rutgers University in the first round of the tournament on March 15.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Women&#039;s lacrosse down Monmouth in decisive victory</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The past week has been a busy one for the women’s lacrosse team. The Bears (4-2, 0-1 Ivy) were edged out by Princeton (3-2, 1-0) 12-10 last weekend before earning a 15-14 win over in-state rival Bryant University (2-2) Wednesday. The action continued Saturday, as Bruno posted 20 goals and displayed strong defensive play at home in a 20-10 victory against the Hawks of Monmouth University (1-6).</p>
<p class="p4">Brown opened scoring in the first thirty seconds of play with a goal from Maggie Fowler ’21. The team conceded to Monmouth a minute and a half later, but quickly went on a 7-0 run to post an 8-1 advantage with 15:10 left to play in the first.</p>
<p class="p4">“Monmouth … started the game off with really high pressure, which was good for our offense because we have a lot of really good dodgers,” said Caroline Zaffino ’19. “That’s the perfect time to drive to cage.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears were able to spread the ball around in their rally with goals from Fowler, Zaffino, Hafsa Moinuddin ’19, Zoe Verni ’19 and Emma DeGennaro ’20 before the Hawks finally replied with just under 17 minutes left in the period.</p>
<p class="p4">The fast start was a point of emphasis for Brown’s offense.</p>
<p class="p4">“Coming off of our last game against Bryant, we didn’t open up that game (as) well as we wanted to,” DeGennaro said. “I think that really gave us a big drive in this game to come out super strong and just put away those shots like we normally do.”</p>
<p class="p4">DeGennaro and Risa Mosenthal ’21 each posted goals to give Bruno an eight-point lead before Monmouth scored with 14:44 left in the half. Mosenthal scored once more before back-to-back goals from Monmouth set the game at 11-4 in favor of the Bears.</p>
<p class="p4">Zaffino notched another goal with five minutes left to play. DeGennaro scored once more with four seconds remaining in the first and sent Bruno into the second half leading 13-5.</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears again got off to a quick start in the second half, as Moinuddin found the back of the net in the first 45 seconds. The goal — her second of the afternoon — put the game at 14-5.</p>
<p class="p4">The rest of the half went back and forth. Monmouth added a goal with 26:06 remaining, which Zaffino followed with her team-high fifth goal of the game. Monmouth then posted its seventh point, before Emma Dahle ’18 answered with another tally for Brown. Subsequent goals by the Hawks and Rosenthal gave Bruno an eleven-goal advantage.</p>
<p class="p4">After another Monmouth goal, Katelyn Igneri ’21 found the net with 6:51 left to play, posting the first goal of her collegiate career.</p>
<p class="p4">KC Williams ’20 scored next for the Bears, earning her first goal of the season. The Hawks scored once more with two and a half minutes left in the game, but Williams posted another goal to secure the victory for Bruno.</p>
<p class="p4">Overall, Brown dominated all phases of the game. Nine different players scored on offense as the team recorded 35 total shots. “What we say is on any given day, anyone can have a multiple goal game,” said Head Coach Keely McDonald ’00. “We want everyone to be a threat.”</p>
<p class="p4">DeGennaro also emphasized the depth of the team’s offense. “Everyone on our offense is a threat, so no matter who has the ball, we trust that that person can score.”</p>
<p class="p4">Strong defensive play matched the team’s offensive success, as Brown caused ten turnovers for the game and forced several shot-clock violations on Monmouth’s offense.</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears’ busy schedule continues next weekend. The team travels to New Haven to face Yale Saturday and returns home to host Iona College Sunday, which will mark a total of five games played in only fifteen days.</p>
<p class="p4">“Something that we like to say is that when we’re tired, our communication is what’s going to be our armor. You’re going to get tired with all these games back-to-back, but when we talk a lot we can help each other be clear, we can help each other out through the game,” Zaffino said. “The thing that our team always falls back on is each other.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Why James Harden is the NBA’s MVP</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the NBA regular season heads towards its conclusion, the MVP conversation is heating up. LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are in the discussion every year as the NBA’s three foremost talents. Anthony Davis, meanwhile, has put up shocking numbers this season, especially after the loss of DeMarcus Cousins, while leading the New Orleans Pelicans to a 38-27 record and vying for a top-three seed in the stacked Western Conference. But make no mistake, James Harden is this year’s MVP. And it shouldn’t even be close.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Harden has come up short several times in the race for the award, finishing in second place in both the 2014-15 and 2016-17 seasons. He lost to Stephen Curry and Russell Westbrook, respectively, undone by historic seasons from the pair. Curry emerged as a superstar in 2014, the best player on a championship, 67-game winning Warriors team. Meanwhile Westbrook, of course, averaged a 30-point triple-double, the first player to achieve the feat since Oscar Robertson in the 1961-62 season. Harden has simply been unlucky.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nothing stands in the guard’s way this year, however. Harden’s statistics speak for themselves. The 28-year-old guard is averaging 31.1 points, 8.8 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game, with a 30.45 Player Efficiency Rating. To put that final mark into perspective, Harden is on track to have the 18th best season of all-time according to PER. Compared to last season, he has improved his three-point shooting and cut down on his turnovers — the only two (slight) offensive criticisms one could make about Harden.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Defense has been Harden’s signature weakness, but he has made great strides in that part of the game and is no longer a complete zero defender. Harden ranks 47th in the league in defensive win shares, just behind Andre Iguodala, Jimmy Butler and Steven Adams, who all have reputations of defensive greatness. For those who favor the eye test over advanced statistics, it is obvious that Harden is putting forth a superior effort to stick with his man and provide help defense when necessary. Instead of standing still gathering his breath, Harden has proven to be active and feisty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, as a team, the Houston Rockets have turned into a juggernaut. The team’s record of 51-14 is a half-game better than the Golden State Warriors’ and the pairing of Harden and guard Chris Paul has worked out splendidly. Though there were initial concerns from many basketball analysts that Harden and Paul would have trouble meshing and sharing the ball, the two have done so effectively. Paul is averaging 8.0 assists per game to Harden’s 8.8, as the two have split up control of the offense. The team as a whole has played well together thanks to Harden’s passing. Clint Capela has continued to progress, averaging a double-double, and several role-players have all fit into the offensive structure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Everything starts with Harden, however, and he has enjoyed the defining moments that an MVP needs. Harden scored 60 points against the Orlando Magic Jan. 30, collecting 10 rebounds and 11 assists as well — an almost incomprehensible stat line in the modern NBA. His Feb. 28 crossover against Wesley Johnson of the Los Angeles Clippers went viral for the move’s incredible disrespect. Harden took a step back, then waited, licking his lips, for Johnson to get back and contest the shot, which went in. This season has belonged to Harden.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That doesn’t mean other players do not belong in the MVP discussion — they just have not had performances equal to Harden’s. Davis probably has the best case for an argument, averaging 28.1 points and 11.1 rebounds per game with a 28.90 PER. Over his last ten games, Davis is averaging 35.6 points and 13.6 rebounds per game, putting the rest of the Pelicans on his back with Cousins out for the season. Unfortunately, Harden’s numbers are slightly better when taken in sum (look to the PER numbers for a good approximation), and when considering New Orleans’ record — a full 13 games worse than Houston’s — it is tough to make a claim for Davis over Harden.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">James’ candidacy has similar problems. The forward deserves more MVPs than his four (voters simply grew tired of voting for him) but this season is not one of those times. James did not put forth his best effort when the Cavaliers were struggling during the grand Isaiah Thomas era and has been disappointing defensively. While James will probably be the best performer in the playoffs when he cranks his energy up to 100 percent, he has not been the most valuable player of this regular season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Curry and Durant cancel each other out. How can one of them be the MVP of the League if we’re not even sure which player is the MVP of the Warriors? Taking into account the added contributions of Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, it is clear that Harden has done more with less: The Houston Rockets are above the Warriors in the standings with three fewer All-Stars. James Harden is on the best team by record in the league with the best stats and best moments. He is the MVP.</span></p>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: The next Babe Ruth is in Tempe, Arizona</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take a moment out of your day and follow me, if you will, on a trip to Tempe, Arizona, which is home to the Los Angeles Angels’ Spring Training facility. You’ll thank me for dragging you along when we get there: We’re going to observe one of the most exciting baseball phenomena of the millennium.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This player has gone by many names. ShoTime. GOATani. A modern-day Babe Ruth. But whatever you want to call Shohei Ohtani, one thing you can’t call him is mundane, ordinary or business as usual. It’s hard for me to understand how Ohtani could be anything less than the most exciting baseball story of the year, or even the decade. And the season hasn’t even started yet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re not familiar with Ohtani’s story, here it is. He spent the first five years of his professional baseball career in the Japan Pacific League, which is part of Japan’s highest professional baseball league, Nippon Professional Baseball. As a pitcher, Ohtani has always been formidable: Over the course of his five seasons in Japan, he put up an earned run average of 2.52, won 42 games and lost only 15. In 2014, he threw the fastest pitch in Japanese baseball history, at 102.5 miles per hour.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But lots of pitchers excel in Japan, and many of them have also excelled in the United States. Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish, Masahiro Tanaka, Hiroki Kuroda, Koji Uehara … the list goes on. Here’s the thing though: Ohtani isn’t even on the list. He’s in another dimension. Here’s why: on his off-days, Ohtani doesn’t rest in the dugout or the bullpen. He plays the outfield.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 2016, while pitching to a 10-4 record with a 1.86 E.R.A., Ohtani broke out at the plate, batting .322/.416/.588, with 22 home runs in only 104 games. Though his 2017 season was shortened by injury, he again batted .322, and put up a .942 on-base plus slugging. And then he came over to the MLB and signed with the Angels. And manager Mike Scioscia assuaged whatever doubt remained when he said at Ohtani’s introductory press conference, “We definitely plan on him being a two-way player, there’s no doubt about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the Angels, Ohtani will likely not be a full-time outfielder when he’s not pitching: Rather, the Angels have indicated that he will share designated hitter duties with Albert Pujols. But Albert Pujols is 37, and was one of the least valuable players in baseball last year. Shohei Ohtani is 23. And — this bears repeating — he has been called the next Babe Ruth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So, here we are. As the 2018 MLB season begins, the Angels will take the field with a player capable by all indications of simultaneously winning a Silver Slugger and a Cy Young. And for the life of me, I don’t understand why baseball fans — or, really, all of America and most of </span>the world — aren’t more excited about this.</p>
<p class="p2">So far, we’ve only gotten a few brief glimpses of Ohtani in training with the Angels. What we’ve seen doesn’t tell us much. Ohtani has gotten off to a slow start on both sides of the ball, but it is also Spring Training, where statistics mean very little, and he has shown nothing but potential. While the numbers from his first start of the spring didn’t look spectacular, several of the pitches did: Ohtani made opposing hitters look foolish, and at times, seemed to simply defy physics.</p>
<p class="p2">But the real allure of Ohtani, right now, isn’t seeing him play. It’s imagining just how good he could be. At 23 years old with a 102 mile per hour fastball and the potential to bat .300/.400/.500 or better with 30-plus home run power, Ohtani, for all intents and purposes, is two complete players, both of whom have superstar potential on their own. I would be thrilled to have the opportunity to watch a player with Ohtani’s background and pitching numbers, or one with the offensive statistics he put up in Japan. To see them both, in the same player, is nothing less than a breathtaking baseball experience.</p>
<p class="p2">This will not happen, but imagine the kind of career numbers a successful Ohtani could put up. Over a 20-year career, he could hit 500 home runs and bat a career .300/.400/.500, while also winning 300 games as a starter with an E.R.A. near or below 3.00. This, I can confidently say, will not happen: It’s baseball and nothing ever works out that well. But for the first time in my living memory, MLB has a player who brings such an outcome into the realm of possibility. And the chance to watch such a player, for as long as his legend persists, isn’t something to be <span class="s1">squandered.</span></p>

		<title>Brown slams season-opening series against Florida A&amp;M, swept by Berkeley</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The baseball team opened its season with a series victory over Florida A&amp;M University and a series loss to the University of California at Berkeley over the past two weeks. The Bears claimed a trio of wins against the Rattlers (6-8) but fell to the Golden Bears (5-2) four games to none. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve shown a lot of positive results both on mound and offensively,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles. “We’ve played well against good teams, too, and have put ourselves in position to win.”</span></p>
<p class="p2">In the season opener against Florida A&amp;M, center fielder Sam Grigo ’18 powered Bruno (3-5) to a 5-2 victory with two home runs. Grigo knocked in his second moonshot in the top of the ninth inning, which extended the Bears’ lead to two and helped the team clinch the win. Starting pitcher Reid Anderson ’18 was stellar on the mound, recording six strikeouts over six innings.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(Anderson) gave us a great start that night,” Grigo wrote in an email to The Herald. “So it was nice to capitalize on his performance and get a win our first time out.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, Bruno’s bats came alive as the team dominated offensively in a 9-1 victory. The Rattlers recorded six hits, but Bruno doubled the mark with 12. Second baseman Rich Ciufo ’20 hit 4-4 for the day and crossed home plate three times, while third baseman Louis Gaitley ’21 tallied three RBIs. Later that afternoon, the Bears had only two hits in the second game of their doubleheader, which ended in a 5-0 loss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“It felt great to be able to contribute in a positive way and help our team win,” Ciufo wrote in an email to The Herald. “We have a lot of talent at every position and our lineup is strong.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The Bears exacted a bit of revenge to close the series against Florida A&amp;M with a 7-0 shutout win. Bruno posted five runs in a hot seventh inning to put victory out of reach for the Rattlers. Gaitley and shortstop Willy Homza ’19 recorded two RBIs each and pitcher Will Tomlinson ’20 earned the win with five scoreless innings. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following weekend, the Bears flew across the country to take on Berkeley in a four-game series. In the series opener, Brown’s pitching could not keep up with red hot Cal as the team fell 11-6. Although Bruno outhit Berkeley 15-13, the Bears gave up two home runs, including a three-run blast in the sixth inning which widened Cal’s lead to four. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That evening, Bruno once again could not contain Berkeley and dropped its second contest 10-9. The Bears gave up two home runs and failed to retaliate with any of their own. Starting pitcher Brennan Vasquez ’21 was pulled in the first inning after giving up six runs, and the Bears were forced to dig deep into their bullpen, sending five pitchers to the mound throughout the game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Coming into this weekend, Cal was ranked third in the country in batting average,” Achilles said. “So in all honesty, I think our guys have done really well. There’s always room for improvement and ways that you need to work to be better, but we are putting ourselves in position to win games and that starts with how we’ve been getting performance on the mound.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears came close to earning a victory Saturday, but were edged out 4-3 in a 12-inning marathon. Bruno took a 3-1 advantage in the sixth inning, but could not hold on in the final frames. An RBI single from Cal second baseman Darren Baker in the bottom of the ninth knotted the game at three. After two scoreless extra innings, Baker struck again in the bottom of the 12th with a walk-off home run to send Bruno to a crushing loss. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The Bears fought hard Sunday, but ultimately fell 7-6 in a close contest against Berkeley. Although Brown maintained a 5-1 lead in the fourth inning, a three-run rally from Cal — highlighted by a walk with the bases loaded — trimmed Bruno’s lead. With the Bears leading by one in the bottom of the eighth, catcher Tyrus Greene erupted with a two-run homer to give the Golden Bears the advantage, which they would not relinquish for the rest of the game. Brown led in hits 10-4, but could capitalize on its opportunity on the road. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s definitely challenging (to play so many road games),” Achilles said. “Our guys have done well with it. It’s something where taking care of your body and getting the right amount of rest is certainly a huge part of being able to recover well.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will stay on the road for the next two weeks, traveling to Dallas Baptist University Friday and Penn next weekend. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our number one objective is to go out every day and give ourselves a chance to win,” Achilles said. “Our main goal for the season is to be competing for the Ivy League championship.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown will open its home slate against Bryant University March 27 at Murray Stadium.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The men’s lacrosse team earned a critical upset victory on the road last weekend against the fourth-ranked team in the nation, Villanova University. After falling behind 6-1 in the second quarter, Brown mounted a comeback late in the game to win 12-9. Luke McCaleb ’20 notched three goals and two assists, scoring two of his goals at crucial moments in the fourth quarter. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">McCaleb, a sophomore from Chevy Chase, Maryland, plays as both an attacker and a midfielder for the Bears. He has scored nine goals and recorded 14 points this season, including a four-goal effort in the team’s first victory of the year against Stony Brook University. For his outstanding performance in the triumph over Villanova, McCaleb has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the huge win against Villanova. Can you talk a little bit about the comeback and how it felt to play so well against tough competition?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">McCaleb: Villanova is a phenomenal team, and they came out firing. They were up 5-0 on us at the beginning of the second quarter, and in the first quarter, we were playing outside of ourselves and not playing our game. Then we buckled down, started moving the ball well, pushing it through behind the goal, moving it up top and getting good looks. Our defense couldn’t have played better. … Our coaches were phenomenal with making great choices, and just pulling together and playing as one team rather than individuals to make that incredible comeback. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>When did you first start playing lacrosse?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">It’s funny — my dad actually was a baseball player and my grandfather was a baseball player. They played football as well, so I grew up as a baseball and football player. But I played (lacrosse) a little bit because I had some buddies in second and third grade (who also played). Then, I dropped baseball in fourth or fifth grade and focused on football and lacrosse, and it took off from there. So I’ve been playing for however many years, but since as long as I can really remember. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>When did you decide that you wanted to play lacrosse in college?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I’d say probably fifth or sixth grade, honestly. I grew up watching some of the great players like Paul Rabil, Rob Pannell, Steele Stanwick and guys like that. Just watching the college lacrosse games — one time I was watching (the University of Virginia) play somebody in fifth or sixth grade, and they went into like eight overtimes. Ever since then, it just looked like a great game and looked like everyone who did it enjoyed it so much. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Really it was the atmosphere, the whole school, the combination of great lacrosse and incredible academics. I came (and) visited, (then) visited a couple of other places, a couple of other Ivy League schools and a couple of the service academies. I just really felt at home at Brown. I liked the diversity of the school and all the different people you see, different people you meet and all the different groups that there are. I was just drawn to it and fell in love with it. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>What’s your favorite part of being on the lacrosse team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I’d definitely say the camaraderie throughout the team and with the coaches. Our coaches are the best coaches in the country. They really love the game, which is important. They say that if you come up here and this isn’t the best part of your day, then I’m doing something wrong. Everyone on the team is just a great guy, who always (has) each other’s back and (is) always looking out for each other. It’s just a great group of friends who all want that common goal of hopefully winning a national championship and winning an Ivy League championship. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have any pre-game rituals?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Yeah, it’s actually pretty funky. Before every game, I actually listen to a song called “Gravel Walk” by The Rogues, and it’s a full bagpipe song. I’ve always done that, and it’s kind of weird because I get ready for the game about five or six hours early, while most of the guys (get ready) two hours before. … I always shoot before the game, throw against the wall before the game and listen to that bagpipes song. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>What are some personal and team goals you have for the season? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For team goals, I’d say we’re just taking it one game at (a) time — just playing our best lacrosse, and it’ll all figure itself out from there. My personal goals (are) to be the best teammate I can be and do whatever is necessary to put the team in the best position that I can to win games. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>What are you concentrating in and what do you hope to do after graduating?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I’m doing the organizational study track and am (concentrating in) Business, Entrepreneurship and Organizations. I’d like to go into the military for a little bit after college. I’m actually going to officer candidate school this summer for the Marine Corps. And then, I don’t know, to be honest. Maybe I’ll be a lacrosse coach, maybe be a teacher or maybe do something else. I really don’t know, but I’m just loving life right now and looking forward to where it takes me.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For the past month, the gymnastics team has narrowly missed topping the 193.325 team score it set in early February, but Brown finally beat its season best with a 193.525 during a quad meet hosted by the University of New Hampshire Sunday. Though Bruno finished fourth behind the University of Kentucky, UNH and Yale, the season-high score helps the Bears as they work to qualify for the USA Gymnastics Collegiate National Championships.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In this final push, so much can happen, so continuing to improve now is what’s going to set us apart,” said Anne Christman ’20. “This is what we’re looking for, and … this is definitely going to put us in a better place (to qualify). It’s super important now, and we’re not done yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears began the competition on floor, where Christman and co-captain Maggie McAvoy ’18 received matching scores of 9.675. Julia Green ’19 supported with a 9.725, and Anya Barca-Hall ’18 earned a 9.750 in the anchor spot to cap off the first rotation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A season-high 48.275 on vault put Bruno on track to break the 193.325 team score as three gymnasts notched a 9.700. The score was a season-best for Gabrielle Hechtman ’19 and a career-high for Christman, who debuted a new tucked full-twisting vault. Green matched her teammates’ marks while Rose Domonoske ’21 and Kate Nelson ’21 supported with 9.575 and 9.600, respectively. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After an explosive second rotation, the Bears settled in and took advantage of the quad meet’s exciting environment. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We did a great job today staying calm but also feeding off the energy of the big arena,” Christman said. “After floor, we were pretty determined to make vault a good rotation, and after the success of vault, everyone felt the calm confidence that definitely helped for bars and beam.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno looked consistent on the uneven bars as five gymnasts scored above a 9.600. Anya Olson ’18 and co-captain Claire Ryan ’18 posted twin scores of 9.650 in the center of the lineup, and Erin Howell ’20 supported with a 9.652. Emma Hansen ’21 led the team on the event with a 9.800, putting the Bears in a solid position going into the last rotation. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown’s final event, the balance beam, was highlighted by powerful acro series and clutch performances by rookies in the middle of the lineup. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Through the season, our beam has been pretty solid, so I know we all just gain confidence every meet,” Domonoske said. “We’re trying to go all out and just be as aggressive as possible.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Domonoske left little room for deduction in her routine, sticking her full-twisting dismount en route to a career-high 9.800, while fellow first-year Hansen upped her own personal best to a 9.725. Ryan and Cassidy Jung ’19 contributed scores of 9.625 and 9.675 while the Bears’ “beam queen” Regan Butchness ’18 closed the competition with a 9.750. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With one remaining regular season meet left before the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championships, Bruno is concentrating on fine-tuning performances and possibly upping the difficulty of some routines. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(We’re) keeping our focus on doing what we can do and not letting what other people do affect us,” Christman said. “As far as gymnastics skills, getting all the little details like landings, any form that is potentially contributing to lower scores … those nitpicky things have been a focus … and just going big because we have nothing to lose.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A quad meet at the University of Bridgeport Saturday and the ECAC Championships are Brown’s last chances to raise their regional qualifying score in order to receive a bid to Nationals and qualify individual athletes to the NCAA Regional Championships. The Bears have competed at Nationals for the last five seasons and hope to keep the streak alive this year. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown has another opportunity to increase its team score as the Bears face off against Bridgeport, Yale and the Centenary College of Louisiana Saturday at 6:30 p.m. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On Friday, members of the men’s track and field team competed at the NCAA Indoor National Championships for the first time in 16 years. Zac Lanigan ’20, co-captain Tosin Oyewole ’18, co-captain Zack Emrich ’18 and Martin Martinez ’18 competed in the distance medley relay, which consists of 1,200-, 400-, 800- and 1,600-meter legs, in that order. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown’s relay team qualified as the last seed of 12 but ultimately exceeded expectations to finish ninth overall in a time of 9:40.24. For their achievement, the team was named Second Team All-Americans, falling short of First Team honors by just one place. Virginia Tech claimed victory in 9:30.76.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Still, Brown’s relay members were not totally satisfied with their Second Team All-American status.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If you … told us last year at this time that we would be the ninth best DMR in the nation, we would’ve been ecstatic — jumping up and down,” Martinez said. “But to be honest, I think everyone was pretty disappointed. … But I think we’re pretty happy with the way we competed, the way we executed what we had to do. It just wasn’t in the cards.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno’s DMR ambitions fell into doubt just two weeks before Nationals, when Lanigan suffered a serious respiratory injury en route to a runner-up finish in the 1,000 meters at the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/02/bears-capture-three-individual-titles-ivy-indoor-track-champs/">Ivy League Indoor Heptagonal Championships</a> on Feb. 25.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was an absolute washing machine for the first four laps. Everyone was just throwing elbows, cutting each other off,” Lanigan said. “It was a really rough race. I tried to go with the move, but due to all the roughness in the race and my preparation beforehand, I just didn’t have it there on the last lap.” Gritting his teeth, Lanigan arrived at the exchange zone in 11th position overall; his 1,200-meter time was 2:59.14. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After receiving the stick from Lanigan, Oyewole — Brown’s 400-meter man — had to negotiate a human traffic jam before he could reach open space. “It was definitely hectic. A lot of pushing going on at the handoff line,” Oyewole said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The senior engaged in a pitched duel for 10th place with Alvin Westbrook of the </span>University of Mississippi<span class="s3">. The two sprinted neck-and-neck for 300 meters, but Oyewole shifted into high gear around the final curve. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The last 100 I was able to pass him,” Oyewole said. “That felt pretty good — to improve a spot and be able to pass someone on the national level.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Oyewole had covered his leg in 48.67 seconds and handed off to Emrich just 0.75 seconds behind ninth-place Wisconsin. But that seemingly insignificant time differential translated into a 10-meter gap on the track, leaving Emrich to run solo behind. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In the 800, you really don’t want to be out in no-man’s land running alone — that’s pretty much a recipe for disaster,” Emrich said. “I definitely overcooked it in the first 200 (meters). I think I went out in 24.4 (seconds) or something like that, which is way, way, way too fast.” Ultimately, the pack eluded Emrich, who recorded a time of 1:49.99 as he brought the baton around in tenth position. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And so it came to pass that Brown’s anchor, Martinez, began his 1,600-meter leg two seconds and two places outside of the top eight. If he could pass two rivals and hang on for the rest of the race, the Bears would return to Providence with First Team All-American trophies. Given the quality of the field, however, it would be extremely difficult to make up so much ground and then defend it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Tactically, it was tough,” Martinez said. “You’re presented with a lot of choices: whether to catch right away or whether to slowly try to catch and not blow your load too soon. That was challenging.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Martinez opted for an aggressive approach, covering his first lap in roughly 28 seconds. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I was proud that he was able to keep his poise and chip away at that lead,” said Head Coach Tim Springfield. “It’s not easy to chase down some of the best milers in the country when you have a little bit of a deficit.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Martinez hopped on the train just as the University of New Mexico’s Josh Kerr, the reigning NCAA indoor mile champ, fell off. “He wasn’t feeling very good,” Martinez recalled. “I could hear him laboring in the race. It was cool to beat a guy like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the end, Brown crossed the line roughly five seconds behind eighth-place finisher Villanova University. “I know I could have run a lot faster if we were presented with a different racing situation, where I didn’t have to chase and I didn’t have to go out as hard,” Martinez said. “But (my time) was 4:02 — a good effort. I’m not disappointed with it.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Springfield was pleased with his athletes’ individual performances. “I was extremely proud,” he said. “Some of the guys got the baton in a little bit of a tough spot, but they ran tactically savvy, and when it got hard at the end, they ran really, really tough.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is unclear where and when the Bears will begin the spring outdoor track season, as the team’s performance could open opportunities to compete at some of the country’s top meets.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I would never have thought at this time last year we would be at Indoor Nationals. So hopefully we’re at Outdoor Nationals,” Lanigan said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">One week out from the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championship, the gymnastics team wrapped up its final meet of the regular season with a third-place finish at the University of Bridgeport. Brown tallied a 192.600 Saturday evening and bested the Centenary College of Louisiana while finishing behind Yale and the Purple Knights. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears are on the brink of qualifying for the USA Gymnastics Collegiate National Championships with only one competition left before teams travel to Texas to vie for the title. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re coming in with this attitude that we have nothing left to hold back,” said Regan Butchness ’18. “This is our last shot. This is the last push, so full steam ahead.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Going into the quad meet at Bridgeport, the team knew they had to put up a solid team score to protect their qualification ranking. The conference meet next Saturday is Bruno’s last opportunity to punch its ticket to the season finale by raising its regional qualifying score.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re in one of the final qualifying spots, so we have to do really well in these last meets,” said Head Coach Sara Carver-Milne. “It’s going to come down to the last meet of the season to determine whether or not we qualify to nationals as a team. … It’s all very, very tight right now. Everyone is within hundredths of tenths.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears kicked off the competition on the balance beam, where they were able to regain composure after a fall early in the lineup and hit five routines for a strong first rotation. Julia Green ’19 and Emma Hansen ’21 posted a pair of 9.600s while Rose Domonoske ’21 supported with a 9.650. Cassidy Jung ’19 built on their scores by tying her season-best 9.700, and Butchness closed out the event with a 9.775 in the anchor spot. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With the most nerve-racking event out of the way, Bruno rotated to floor exercise where all gymnasts posted scores of 9.600 or above. Anya Olson ’18 earned a 9.625, and Anne Christman ’20 contributed a 9.725. Julia Green ’19 led the team with a 9.775, and Anya Barca-Hall ’18 recorded a 9.650 to bring the Bears to the halfway point. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After two events, Brown sat in second, trailing Yale by six tenths of a point. The Bears took to the vault for their third rotation, boasting upgraded skills and stronger execution. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re peaking at the right time, and at this point in the season, a lot of teams are tired and worn out,” Carver-Milne said of the team’s improvements. “Our team is still thriving, upgrading and growing every week.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">En route to tying a season-high 48.275, Kate Nelson ’21 scored a 9.575, and Gabrielle Hechtman ’19 earned a 9.650. Christman and Green added matching marks of 9.675 while Alyssa Gardner ’21 competed the most difficult vault in the lineup for a 9.700.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears ended the meet on what is usually their strongest event, the uneven bars. But the pressure of qualifying for nationals took a toll on the lineup and resulted in uncharacteristic mistakes from the final two competitors. Though Bruno had to count a routine with a fall, Olson and co-captain Claire Ryan ’18 helped Brown stay on track with scores of 9.700 and 9.600, respectively. Caroline Warren ’21 and Erin Howell ’20 also contributed matching 9.525s at the top of the lineup and brought up the final team score of 192.600.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With only a few practices left before facing off against conference rivals, the Bears are staying focused on themselves and preparing for the unconventional format of ECACs, which features two byes among six rotations. Bruno has high expectations for the championship and aims for six hit routines on every apparatus and a team total above 193. Carver-Milne is confident the team can come together to put up a solid performance. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re in a great spot,” she said. “The team is healthy and motivated. Their minds are set on our team goals, so we’ll pull through. … It’s so tight right now that it’s kind of anyone’s game, but I really don’t doubt that we will continue to be in one of those qualifying spots.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Butchness similarly captured this sentiment: “There is just something special riding on the fact that this very well could be our last meet as a team, and if we don’t want that outcome then we should definitely come together as a team. … I’m so ignited to really just do my best gymnastics and be fully present and in the moment come Saturday.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown’s fight for the ECAC title and a final shot at nationals begins Saturday at noon. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: MLB’s baserunner rule is ineffective and inorganic</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Besides an email from a Baseball Writers’ Association of America member angry at my criticisms of Hall of Fame voting procedures in<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/12/02/schapiro-19-hall-marty-nobles-automatics/"> December 2016</a>, my columns don’t usually generate many responses. So you can imagine how excited I was when I saw that Patrick Nugent ’21 had written an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/02/nugent-21-extra-inning-baserunner-rule-does-not-hurt-baseball/">op-ed</a> in response to my last <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/01/schapiro-19-rob-manfred-crosses-rubicon/">column</a>, in which I criticized Minor League Baseball’s use of a new rule to automatically place runners on base after the 10th inning.</p>
<p class="p2">“The idea that the rule doesn’t address a problem is wrong — it just doesn’t address the problem you think it does,” Nugent argues. The real problem the rule addresses, he writes, is that decreased starting pitcher workload has led to increased fatigue and injury among relief pitchers, whose increased value in recent years has made these kinds of injuries more costly to their teams.</p>
<p class="p2">But I would urge readers to remember: Just because this rule would reduce injuries to relief pitchers does not mean it is a good way to do so. Lots of rules would accomplish this goal but would also be clearly ridiculous, like requiring all relievers to wear Kevlar body armor or pitch from behind a safety net. So, is this particular rule worth it?</p>
<p class="p2">You already know my view, which is that it is not. There are all kinds of ways that MLB could protect relief pitchers without giving out free baserunners. It could expand rosters from 25 players to 28, allowing space for up to three more relief pitchers to dilute heavy workloads. It could direct increased funding to biomechanical studies and technology, which could allow teams to more effectively evaluate the causes of injuries to pitchers. It could mandate moving outfield fences back, resulting in fewer home runs, more outs and quicker innings, or it could slightly deaden baseballs — making them less firm so they don’t come off the bat as hard — with similar results. All of these things could be done effectively — and all, I’d say, would be far less disruptive and nonsensical than just giving out free runners.</p>
<p class="p2">Nugent then argues that the proposed rule would incentivize small ball, which, given the increased home run frequency across baseball, is an outcome I would also support. I love small ball — a well-executed suicide squeeze is my favorite play in baseball. But a rule change like this is not the way to bring it back. How do you incentivize small ball? In the ways described above: Make it harder to hit home runs, so that swinging for the fences is less likely to pay off. Small ball has declined because MLB teams have realized that power is more valuable than contact and that flyballs are more valuable than grounders. Unless flyballs become less valuable, the current trends toward more power and less small ball will continue. “Hitters, armed with better and more extensive data than ever,” the Washington Post reported last year, are “reaching the conclusion that not only are flyballs, on average, better than grounders but that the latter are to be avoided<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/sports/mlb-launch-angles-story/?utm_term=.463c7e7dca14"> at all costs.”</a> The Post quoted 2015 American League MVP Josh Donaldson: “Groundballs are outs. If you see me hit a groundball, even if it’s a hit, I can tell you: It was an accident.”</p>
<p class="p2">Hitters have systematically adjusted their swings away from small ball and toward power-hitting, regardless of game situation. And you can’t undo such an adjustment simply by putting free runners on base in extra innings. I love a good bunt more than anything — but when Joey Gallo, or one of the many players like him, comes to bat, it’s easy to tell that he’s swinging for the fences whether there’s a man on second or not.</p>
<p class="p2">“Baseball is steeped in tradition, but perhaps its most pervasive tradition is change,” Nugent then argues. As examples, he cites the five-man rotation, increased defensive shifts and the designated hitter. But it’s interesting — two of these, the five-man rotation and the defensive shift, didn’t come about through rule changes. They came from natural adaptation as teams fought to gain advantages on the field. The other example, the designated hitter — the only one listed that was an official rule change — is, like giving out free baserunners, something I heartily<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/16/schapiro-19-designated-hitter-overdue-retirement/"> disagree with.</a> And baseball fans agree with me: A 2016 poll conducted by Public Policy Polling found that 65 percent of respondents favored pitchers hitting over designated hitters, while 25 percent stated <a href="https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PPP_Release_National_51216.pdf">the opposite.</a> Certainly, baseball is always changing. And the best changes are those made by the teams on the field, not the lawyers in the commissioner’s office.</p>
<p class="p2">Like I’ve said, in the end, this is a philosophical question. I don’t support putting runners on base in extra innings because it would distort a fundamental part of baseball — the process of scoring a run — for purposes that could either be better achieved in other ways (like decreasing pitcher fatigue) or shouldn’t be achieved at all (increasing pace-of-play). To merit a change as radical as this, MLB needs to show both that it is in pursuit of objectives that are essential and that such a proposal is the best or only way to achieve them. And as far as free runners on second base go, so far, MLB has shown neither.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The baseball team fell in a three-game series on the road to Dallas Baptist University this weekend, losing their first two contests 17-2 and 14-4 before claiming a 9-5 victory in their final matchup Sunday. The Bears moved to 4-7 on the season and halted a six-game losing streak following a series defeat at the University of California, Berkeley last weekend. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think we definitely dug some holes for ourselves — we had the opportunity to make plays defensively and then execute some pitches at times that we didn’t do,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles. “But … we competed, especially (in) game three. We did a great job on the mound offensively and defensively, making the Dallas Baptist team really play our game. (I’m) really proud of our guys and how they finished the weekend.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 2, Dallas Baptist 17</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the series opener, the Bears (4-7) were outmatched from the first pitch, as the Patriots (11-7) managed to cross the plate six times in the first two innings alone. In total, Dallas Baptist hit seven home runs and recorded 19 hits. Infielder Garett Delano ’20 hit Bruno’s lone home run of the game, and catcher Mark Sluys ’19 tallied an RBI on a sacrifice fly. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Rebounding from the kind of loss we took (in the first game) is all about turning the page — something I think this group is really good at,” wrote center fielder Sam Grigo ’18 in an email to The Herald. Strong performances on the mound from relief pitchers Calvin Farris ’20 and Dustin Baird ’20 were highlights of the game, Grigo added. “(They) did a great job battling and soaking up much needed innings in relief against a team that can really swing it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 4, Dallas Baptist 14</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, Bruno stood firm in the opening innings and kept the score close with the Patriots. In the top of the fifth inning, Brown trimmed Dallas Baptist’s lead to two after shortstop Louis Gaitley ’21 hit a single that sent second baseman Rich Ciufo ’20 sprinting across home plate for a run.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“One of my main goals for the season is to have quality at bats and help the team in anyway I can,” Ciufo wrote in an email to The Herald. “If each guy comes into each game confident and willing to do whatever it takes to help the team, we will be very successful.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the wheels quickly fell off for the Bears, as the bottom of the fifth saw the Patriots score five runs to put the game out of reach for Bruno. A rain delay postponed the game in the seventh inning, but Brown could not turn the tide in the final innings the next morning, eventually falling 14-4. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 9, Dallas Baptist 5</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the final game of the series later that afternoon, the Bears jumped out to an early lead when Grigo hit a two-run single to left field. In the fifth inning, starting pitcher Delano threw his way out of a bases-loaded jam, leading the Bears out of the frame unscathed to preserve the team’s slim advantage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the eighth inning, Brown’s bats caught fire as the Bears notched five runs — including a two-run moonshot by Ciufo — to put the game out of reach for the Patriots. The Bears recorded 11 hits in the four-run victory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have a team that — freshmen through seniors — does an awesome job showing up every day with confidence regardless of what happened the day before,” Grigo wrote. “Baseball is too hard and too random to sweat our results on a game-to-game basis, and we have a group that’s always focused.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will begin Ivy League play next weekend, facing off with Penn in a three-game series on the road. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our team is very confident right now. From just the health perspective, we’re really counting on getting some guys back and getting guys healthy this week,” Achilles said. “I’m just hopeful that this is going to be a very positive week for us to build into going into Ivy play.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown will host Ocean State rival Bryant University for the team’s home opener at Murray Stadium March 27.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Entering the weekend off of a win against a previously undefeated Villanova University squad, the men’s lacrosse team hoped to serve Harvard its second loss of the season. However, strong goalkeeping and a consistent offensive attack allowed the Crimson (5-1, 0-1 Ivy) to narrowly edge out the Bears (2-3, 0-1), 10-8 Saturday. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Harvard opened scoring with 9:45 left in the first quarter. The Crimson struck again less than a minute later and held onto the lead for the duration of the matchup. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jackson Newsome ’19 notched the first point for the Bears midway through the quarter and scored his initial goal in what would become a hat-trick effort. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Crimson responded quickly, scoring once more to put the game at 3-1 with just under five minutes remaining in the period. Jake Miller ’18 replied with a goal 10 seconds later and trimmed the deficit to one before the end of the stanza.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second quarter followed a pattern similar to that of the first, as Harvard posted the opening pair of goals. Carson Song ’19 scored with 4:54 remaining in the second, and Harvard followed with a goal roughly two minutes later. Michael Panepinto ’19 found the back of the net as another 3-2 quarter gave the Crimson a 6-4 lead over the Bears entering halftime.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Newsome got Bruno off to a quick start in the second half by recording a goal in the first 40 seconds of the third period. However, the Crimson widened its lead with three straight goals, and the Bears found themselves at a 9-5 deficit with 8:23 to go in the third quarter. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Stephen Hudak ’18 ended Harvard’s run by finding the back of the net three minutes later. Newsome then scored his third goal of the afternoon with four seconds left in the period and narrowed Harvard’s advantage to two upon entering the final quarter of play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The fourth quarter was a low-scoring affair, as the Crimson put away a goal with 6:16 left to play. Panepinto scored again with just over two minutes remaining and set the game at its eventual final score of 10-8. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears finished with a season-high 45 shots on the game, but the team struggled to convert these attempts into points. Only 25 shots were on goal, and Harvard managed to make 17 saves for the afternoon. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Hats off to that goalie — he played a great game,” said Luke McCaleb ’20. “But the harder you make it for the goalie, the easier it is to win and score goals. So I think the biggest thing is just getting back out there … making sure we’re flowing and finishing our shots.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Newsome led overall scoring for Brown with three goals. Song paced the team with four assists, and Phil Goss ’20 posted nine saves on the afternoon. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We worked really hard and played with a lot of heart, but we didn’t execute. Our fundamentals weren’t there most of the game,” wrote Miller in an email to The Herald. “Their settled defense (stifled) us and we missed valuable chances to take the ball away.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The loss to Harvard marks yet another narrow defeat for Bruno, as all three of the team’s losses on the season have come by a margin of two goals or fewer. According to McCaleb, the team can end up on the right side of close finishes by sticking to the basics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s the little things that make the biggest difference, whether it’s riding for one more second, … finishing one more shot or coming to and through a pass,” McCaleb said. “Those little things build up, and they turn into big things, which end in wins.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will be back in action Tuesday as they travel to Worcester to face the College of the Holy Cross before returning home to host the University of Massachusetts Amherst Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s fourth down with under a minute to play in the 2014 NFC Championship. The San Francisco 49ers are knocking at the door of the Seattle Seahawks’ end zone, and they have one last chance to erase a 23-17 Seahawks lead. Colin Kaepernick drops back and unfurls a looping pass to the corner of the endzone. But before the ball can land in the hands of intended receiver Michael Crabtree, Richard Sherman breaks up the pass and tips it into the hands of a teammate. “The Tip,” as it came to be known in the archives of Seattle sports history, arrived at the zenith of a long-escalating rivalry and mutual disdain between the two NFC West foes. Impassioned and with a microphone stuck into his face after having executed the most important play of his career, Sherman spouted an angry sound bite that any Seattle sports fan can recognize: “Well I’m the best corner in the game. When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that’s the result you’re going to get. Don’t you ever talk about me.”</p>
<p class="p2">Next season, Sherman will don the jersey of the 49ers — the very team whose Super Bowl hopes he dashed fewer than four years ago. And that’s a good thing.</p>
<p class="p2">It’s good because he is making more money than the Seahawks were likely willing to give him, and it’s good because loyalty does not and should not matter in a profit-motivated and success-driven league where players are becoming increasingly expendable.</p>
<p class="p2">Sherman’s decision to sign with his former team’s most hated rival was met with disappointment and anger from many Seahawks fans. Such is often the case when free agency gives players the ability to choose with which team to sign. It is a time when the conflicting motivations of fans and athletes clash, and when fans are made acutely aware of their delusion — that the connection they feel with a team is also felt by those who play for it. During this period, accusations of disloyalty and betrayal are leveled at athletes who switch teams in order to earn more.</p>
<p class="p2">And just a few days into NFL free agency, situations similar to Sherman’s are occurring around the league.</p>
<p class="p2">The three main actors in sports — fans, players and management — are all driven by different motivations. To fans, loyalty is paramount; they are often supporters for life, and there is little more axiomatic than their fandom. Management is motivated by winning games and making money. The decision-makers of the most respected organizations in the league often disregard loyalty in the strategic interest of the team. Bill Belichick and Pete Carroll, for example, seem to have no problem trading or cutting superstars if they think it will make their team better. These decisions are often motivated by a “next man up” mentality, which depersonalizes athletes and makes their efforts expendable.</p>
<p class="p2">But athletes are driven by an entirely different motivation. Sure, many NFL players are motivated by the glory of winning a Super Bowl, but their primary motivation will almost always be money.</p>
<p class="p2">The greatest imbalance between the motives of these three groups is that fans and managers are primarily concerned with the success of the team, while athletes are concerned with their financial well-being, as they know that their athletic abilities are ephemeral. The foundation of an athlete’s livelihood is a fleeting period of supreme physical condition — one that can be taken away by a damaging hit to their head or a turn of their knee. This profitable period needs to be seized, especially in football, where the average player’s career lasts only 3.3 years. In addition, the restrictive policies of the NCAA add to the situation as the culmination of an athlete’s life-long effort can only be monetized as a professional for a brief period of time. Compensation for 3.3 years of work is certainly not enough to sustain a lifetime.</p>
<p class="p2">So what are athletes to prioritize? Are they to buy into the fans’ notions of loyalty and remain with a team that pays them less? Or are they to lobby for themselves and take advantage of the maximum wage they can earn for their work?</p>
<p class="p2">To me, the choice is clear. It stands to reason that if a coach or general manager is not going to be loyal to a player, a player should not be loyal to them – no matter what the fans say. In a system that is built on the commodification and expendability of an athlete in order to benefit the well-being of the team as a whole, where management will not blink an eye before releasing a still-productive player rather than continuing to pay him, athletes have no choice but to advocate for themselves and make the most money they can.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Before notching a 6-1 victory over Stony Brook University, the women’s tennis team (6-7) had not won a match in a month. But the Bears broke the drought Saturday as Alyza Benotto ’18 contributed two points to the team score and helped put Bruno on top. The veteran paired up with first-year teammate Semi Oloko ’21 to down the Seawolves (4-4) 6-2 and secure the doubles point for Brown before going on to dominate her singles match, winning 6-0, 6-1.</p>
<p class="p4">For her clutch performances and leadership on the court, Benotto received Brown University Athletics Student-Athlete of the Week honors and has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the win! What was going through your head during your doubles and singles matches? </b></p>
<p class="p4">Benotto: Thank you! For doubles I’m playing with a (first-year), Semi Oloko, so I kind of have to show her the ropes while we’re playing, get her pumped up and manage her while managing me, too, which is a challenge but fun at the same time. … Our biggest issue (in doubles) is that we’re not aggressive enough sometimes. So my job is to try to at least make us come to the net more, poach and always keep (Oloko) hyped up, because if we fall flat, we’ll make stupid errors.</p>
<p class="p4">In singles, to be honest, I just played really well. … I was playing super steady. My serve was really good.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>Do you get nervous during matches? How do you handle the nerves?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yeah, my hands get really, really clammy when I play. Even in the middle of a point, I have to wipe it on my skirt because I get so nervous. When you get nervous, it shuts down your body. You’re almost like paralyzed. Then your legs go, and once your legs go, you’re like, “Oh my god, I can’t run!” And then your arms go, and you’re like, “Oh my god, I can’t swing!” Then you’re freaking out. … It’s tennis, so you can’t sub someone in. You have to sit there and just reset and breathe. … My trick is to take really deep breaths, and I say weird things to myself. I say “blank.” I just keep repeating “blank” in my head because then I don’t think about anything but that one neutral word. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have any superstitions or pre-game rituals? </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I’m really superstitious on the court. When I walk, I don’t walk on the lines. … I have two separate balls depending on which side I serve on. … If I put my waters down to my right and I lose the game, I’m like, “Alright, that obviously didn’t work. Gotta move it.” If something works, I don’t change. If I mess up, obviously I jinxed myself, so I change everything.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How did you first start playing tennis?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My mom, when she was in her twenties, dated this professional tennis player. They broke up, but ever since then, she was like “Oh my god, tennis is amazing. I love it so much.” … I’m from (Los Angeles), and our family and a bunch of other families were part of this country club. All of the parents threw us into tennis just so the moms could talk and hang out. The coach, one day, was like, “Alyza’s actually pretty good. You should get her private lessons.” … Then I started to do private lessons, and here I am. … I was training to be pro, but I wanted to go to college first. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Is there a player you model your game after?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My favorite player is Serena Williams just because she’s a beast, and she’s from (Los Angeles). My old coach used to be (Maria) Sharapova’s coach, so he modeled my strokes after her — at least my backhand. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What are your personal goals and the team goals for the rest of the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For team goals, it’s definitely win (the Ivy League Championships). That’s always our main one, because if we win Ivies, we get a ticket to NCAAs. … I want a ring for sure. Our text group chat is “ring season.” Individually, win all my matches from here on out. Play my game style and don’t revert back to pushing. … Just be brave is my mental goal. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>As your tennis career at Brown comes to a close, what will you miss the most? </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I’ll miss just being an athlete. It’s kind of a sense of pride … you work hard at something. There’s an end goal with your team. After that, it’s kind of like, “Okay, now what?” If I’m going to play tennis, it’s going to be for myself, and that’s a lot of work. I’ll definitely miss the team aspect of it. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What are your plans post-graduation?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I go back and forth because my family is like super “go pro, go pro, go pro.” But I want to see how I am at the end of the season. If my body is still in great shape and no injuries. If my spirit’s not broken. … The optimal life path would be to get a job and maybe train on the side. … Maybe work for a year, and if I’m still feeling it, maybe try to go pro.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>What has been your favorite memory of your collegiate tennis career?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I really, really like traveling with the team. Whenever we go somewhere, it’s always super fun. Two years ago, we went to Florida for spring break. We got time to go to the beach, and it was just fun to be somewhere else with your closest friends.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will travel to Florida over spring break to face off against the University of South Florida and the University of Central Florida before returning to New England for a slate of Ivy League matches. </span></p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Why the Warriors won’t dominate the playoffs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With spring finally here, we are only a couple of weeks away from the NBA playoffs. Entering this season, the Golden State Warriors were widely assumed to be shoe-ins for the championship once again. After all, they went 16-1 in the playoffs last year, then retained Kevin Durant and even added productive role players in Nick Young, Omri Casspi and Jordan Bell. Yet, not everything has gone smoothly for the Warriors over the past few months. The team is plagued by injuries, and key back-ups have declined. Beware: Golden State may not have the same easy and comfortable walk to the championship this season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stephen Curry’s ankle has returned as an issue. The guard struggled at times to stay on the court during the early part of his career thanks to consistent ankle sprains. He played in only 26 games for the 2011-12 season. After a well-publicized sneaker change, Curry appeared to have put his ankle problems behind him. But now, they have come back. The 30-year-old has missed a substantial amount of time with multiple ankle sprains, participating in only 50 contests thus far. We learned in 2016 that a banged-up Curry is not the same force of nature that NBA fans have grown accustomed to watching after the Cleveland Cavaliers were able to grind out Golden State for a seven-game series win. Golden State does not have the same offensive dominance and flair without a healthy star point guard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And Curry is far from the only member of the Warriors with injury concerns. Klay Thompson is out with a fractured right thumb. Kevin Durant will miss two weeks with a rib fracture. Draymond Green went down this past week with a midsection contusion. After years of good injury luck, the pendulum has swung the other way for the Warriors. While everyone is expected to be back for the playoffs, the team will enter its first-round series out of rhythm. Curry’s ankle is far from secure, too — it could turn or roll again quite easily.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Golden State’s bench, meanwhile, has been less productive than in past years. Andre Iguodala is a shell of his former self on offense. He is averaging just 6.0 points, 3.9 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game on 46.7 percent shooting (26.7 percent on threes). This season is the worst of his career by a good margin. Patrick McCaw has completely lost his shooting touch and spent time in the G-League to try to correct his stroke, also missing time recently with a wrist injury. The guard is shooting just 24.2 percent from three-point range. That’s two important role players who are largely missing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But who could possibly beat the Warriors in the postseason? The Houston Rockets are an easy first answer. Guards James Harden and Chris Paul make all the headlines, but the Rockets have a lot of depth that could be the difference in a series with Golden State. Clint Capela is one of the most underrated players in the game, able to dominate the glass. Eric Gordon, Gerald Green, Trevor Ariza, Ryan Anderson and P. J. Tucker can all let it fly from the perimeter. Tucker brings an element of toughness that Houston has lacked in recent seasons, a counter to Green’s intensity. While the Warriors are clearly the more talented team still, the Rockets can play them close. Houston has won two out of three regular season games between the teams.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I consider Oklahoma City to be another potential threat. Russell Westbrook and Paul George are the obvious names, but Steven Adams could be the key to beating Golden State. Adams is one of the strongest big men in the game and can torch the Warriors on the boards and in the paint if they ever try to go small. Between those three guys and new addition Corey Brewer, Oklahoma City has defensive strength all over the court. It is simply hard to score on the Thunder. Carmelo Anthony will have to regain some of his old form for the upset to happen, however. Instead of channeling “Olympic Melo,” Anthony has been off with his shot all year and has been a ball-stopper at times. He is shooting 36.3 percent from three-point range on the season, and OKC needs him to catch fire for a round with the Warriors — if Anthony hits around 40 percent of his long-range shots, the Thunder can hang with Golden State.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Eastern Conference contenders pose less of a threat. The Cavaliers are worse than last year by a good amount, without a star secondary shot-creator. The Celtics have been ruined by injuries — Kyrie’s knee has to be a major worry for any Boston fan at this point. The Raptors have enjoyed a terrific regular season, but DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry have yet to prove that they can maintain a consistent high level in the playoffs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Golden State Warriors are still, by far, the likeliest team to win the Finals. But the journey to the championship poses more of a challenge this season. Don’t be surprised to see Golden State battling to escape the Western Conference.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For the sixth consecutive year, the gymnastics team has qualified for the USA Gymnastics Collegiate National Championships. After finishing third at the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championship March 24, the Bears secured their spot among eight teams by posting a season-high 194.025 last weekend, and will travel to Texas Woman’s University in two weeks to vie for the national title.</p>
<p class="p2">“This has been our goal all year,” said Head Coach Sara Carver-Milne. “At the beginning of the year, it was looking a little rocky, and we weren’t putting together the best performances that we needed to solidify a spot for Nationals. But true to our team motto, Grit — greatness revealed in time —, we continued to stay on the right path, be patient and know that if we just continued to work and improve each week that we were going to qualify.”</p>
<p class="p2">Going into the conference championship, Brown was ranked sixth. After nailing season-best performances on vault and balance beam, the Bears finished ahead of host Penn, Cornell and first-ranked Temple University to prove they deserved a ticket to Texas.</p>
<p class="p2">“It was incredibly rewarding at ECACs because we knew we had to have a season high, and that can put a lot of pressure on the team,” Carver-Milne said. “But they actually took it more as an opportunity, embraced it and had a blast during the entire competition.”</p>
<p class="p2">Three competitors earned individual recognition. Cassidy Jung ’19 tied for third on beam to earn First Team All-ECAC recognition and Julia Green ’19 tied for fifth on vault to receive Second Team All-ECAC honors. Anya Barca-Hall ’18 was also recognized for academic achievements, getting named as an ECAC Scholar-Athlete of the Year.</p>
<p class="p2">To kick off the competition, Bruno took to the uneven bars where Caroline Warren ’21 set the stage with a 9.600 in the first routine of the meet. Erin Howell ’20 followed with a 9.625, and co-captain Claire Ryan ’18 built on their scores, posting a 9.675. Anya Olson ’18 led the team with a 9.700, and Kate Nelson ’21 capped off Brown’s first rotation with a 9.575.</p>
<p class="p2">A season-high 48.675 on beam midway through the meet put the Bears in prime position to record a strong team score. Ryan and Green posted matching marks of 9.675 at the top of the lineup while Rose Domonoske ’21 added a 9.725. Emma Hansen ’21 earned a season-best 9.775, and Jung tied her career-high of 9.825 to help Brown stay on pace with its competitors.</p>
<p class="p2">After two events, Bruno left the competition floor, using its third-rotation bye to refocus in the locker room.</p>
<p class="p2">“We started really strong on bars and beam, … so we were just holding on to that energy,” said co-captain Maggie McAvoy ’18. “We tried to stay relaxed and calm but also remember that we’re here to do a job.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears re-entered the meet on floor exercise where McAvoy kept the momentum alive with a 9.700. Olson posted a season-high 9.750 which Anne Christman ’20 matched in the middle of the lineup. Green performed a sky-high double back pike and double back tuck to tally Bruno’s top score of 9.800 while Barca-Hall capped off the event with a 9.675.</p>
<p class="p2">With one event left, Brown needed big scores on vault to ensure a place atop the podium. Nelson posted a 9.600 to give the Bears a solid foundation, and Gabrielle Hechtman ’19 followed with a 9.675. Performances by Christman and Green highlighted the final rotation as Christman stuck her tucked full-twisting vault perfectly for a personal-best 9.750, and Green nailed her front handspring front pike to tie her career-high 9.775. Alyssa Gardner ’21 earned a 9.700 for a full-twisting layout in the anchor spot, bringing up a season-high 48.500 on the event.</p>
<p class="p2">As their competitors rotated to their last events, the Bears returned to the locker room for their second bye and celebrated a successful performance.</p>
<p class="p2">“For us, it wasn’t really even nerves about Nationals or nerves about how we were going to place at the end of the day,” McAvoy said. “We competed like we needed to compete, so hopefully the cards were going to fall in place.”</p>
<p class="p2">The 194.025 helped Bruno qualify as the number seven seed heading into Nationals where Brown will compete against Yale, Cornell and Texas Woman’s University in the second preliminary session April 13 at 8 p.m. The top two teams for each session will advance to team finals April 14, and individual event finals will be held April 15.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: Rob Manfred crosses the Rubicon</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In consideration of all the harm he’s brought on my favorite sport, I’d say I’ve been pretty lenient with Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. I’ve acknowledged the positive things he’s done, and given him the benefit of the doubt when he’s made proposals that I’ve disagreed with. But 13 months ago, I drew a line in the sand when Manfred was reportedly considering testing a proposal in the minor leagues: Starting each extra inning with a runner on second base.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“No more benefit of the doubt, no more chances for redemption, no more let’s wait and see,” <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/09/schapiro-19-official-mlb-lost-mind/">I wrote</a>. “This is a stupid proposal, implemented by stupid people, for stupid reasons. None of this belongs anywhere near the national treasure that is Major League Baseball.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But last month, Minor League Baseball announced comprehensive rule changes for the 2018 season. Among them was the decision to place an automatic runner on second base during extra innings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this point, I don’t know if it’s worth it to reason against the decision. How can you explain that you shouldn’t just give out free runners? Manfred’s rule is not rational, and there’s not much that can be done about it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Where to begin? This rule is so clearly awful for so many reasons that it feels gratuitous to explain it. For one, the rule change doesn’t address an existing problem. Are there actually baseball fans out there who are happy to watch entire games, but get bored once extra innings begin? Making extra innings quicker is even less sensible than making the first nine innings quicker — and nobody wants that.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most of the baseball fans I’ve talked to, in fact, want the opposite: They love long, extra-inning games. If you’re a fan of the sport, how could you not? It’s extra baseball, where the most endearing quirks of the game are forced out into the open for fans’ delighted observation. Position players pitching? The last man on the bench winning it with a big hit? These are the best parts of baseball, not problems.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition, it will now be very easy to get a baserunner to third base with fewer than two outs. Winning a game in extra innings will come down to little more than the ability to hit a fly ball deep enough to bring home a runner from third. I can’t fathom how this is more exciting than starting off an inning with the bases empty, as innings have always started. There won’t even be any need for dramatic extra-inning home runs anymore: Who needs a homer when one single can end the game in a flash?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If this is not enough, there’s another problem with the rule. It seems that giving each team the same advantage in extra innings is the equivalent of not giving out an advantage at all. Both teams will get free runners on second base, and both teams’ chances of scoring will increase identically. Thus, every advantage one team gains from this rule will be canceled out by an equal and opposite advantage gained by the other. You might as well grant each team a certain number of free runs every inning. It wouldn’t have any real effect on games, but run production would skyrocket.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I struggle to understand how anyone could judge the rule as acceptable, but there’s more. There’s a deeper issue with this — it just isn’t baseball. I know other countries use this rule and that’s fine, but they have different baseball histories then we do. We’ve played this game the same way for well over a century. And to suddenly impose a rule that fundamentally changes the way an important aspect of our game works? And what’s more, to do it for no discernible reason? How can that be justified?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Manfred’s newest project is the worst of both worlds. It’s just like one of the rules above: It’s not part of baseball, and never should be. But it also has its own distinctly negative effects. It will make the game less exciting and more predictable and will artificially increase offensive numbers. And it will destroy the fun of extra innings — which many baseball fans love.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For some time now, Manfred has seemed determined to change the game of baseball as we know it. I’ve never quite taken him to task for it, but I am now. This proposal does not belong anywhere in the game of baseball. It should be abandoned, quickly forgotten and consigned to obscurity.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The softball team won its second conference game of the season last weekend, earning a 4-0 victory against Penn at home. The team was led by starting pitcher Emily Waters ’20, who pitched a complete game shutout and allowed only four hits and three walks with no errors. The Bears scored a pair of runs in both the third and fourth innings to help defeat the Quakers and move to 2-4 in the Ivy League.</p>
<p class="p4">Waters, a sophomore from Northridge, California, is a right-handed ace for Bruno. With her most recent victory, she holds a 2-5 mark on the season and has recorded 16 total strikeouts. For her outstanding performance in the victory against Penn, Waters has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the win against Penn. Can you talk a little about the game and how it felt to play so well?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Waters: Thank you! Coming into it, I felt pretty confident because I think we did a really good job scouting. We had a good plan and stuck to it, and everything just went smoothly with no hiccups.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When did you first start playing softball and when did you become a pitcher?</b></p>
<p class="p3">When I was about six years old, I think. My mom played softball growing up, and she was a pitcher. So, that’s what she just taught me to do growing up.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When did you decide that you wanted to play softball in college?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Probably in middle school. I started getting into travel ball, being more competitive and seeing some of the older girls in my organization going on to play in college. So, I thought that was something that I wanted to do.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I’m from California, so I was looking at schools on the West Coast like (the University of California at San Diego and St. Mary’s College of California). And then looking on the East Coast, it was basically just Brown. So for me, it was go home or go away. And I guess I wanted to experience something new and come to the East Coast. When I visited Brown, I loved it. I loved the girls that were on the team already (who) kind of showed me around.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>What is your favorite part of being on the softball team?</b></p>
<p class="p3">It’s like having another family. I don’t really get homesick being here because it’s like I have my own little family. The older girls are like mentors and I can go to them for anything.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Do you have any pregame rituals?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I do not. I guess I do my hair the same way every day (that I pitch). That’s about it.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>What are some of your team and personal goals for the season?</b></p>
<p class="p3">(For) team goals, probably to be competitive in the Ivy League. Our goals are always to be above .500 in the Ivy League. I think we are on our way to doing that. Personal goals for me (are) just to be pitching well as a team. As a pitcher, you don’t want to win games for your team. You just want to keep your team in the game.</p>
<p class="p3">The Bears will return to the field this weekend to host Cornell before facing the University of Rhode Island Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="p4"><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Who will win the NBA tank race?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The NBA playoffs are fast approaching, with anticipation growing accordingly. Sports fans cannot wait to find out if Stephen Curry can return healthy, if the Rockets can take down the Warriors and if LeBron James can make yet another NBA Finals appearance. But lost in all the playoff excitement is the closest race in the NBA, one that could have enormous ramifications for the future of the league: the race for last place.</p>
<p class="p2">The NBA’s lottery reform measures will begin next season, so for one last time, teams can secure the best possible lottery odds by obtaining bottom positions in the league standings. There are five prospects: DeAndre Ayton, Luka Dončić, Mohamed Bamba, Marvin Bagley III and Michael Porter Jr., who are all considered superstar potential, a talent pool that has led many organizations to take drastic steps for worsening their teams.</p>
<p class="p2">There are currently nine franchises vying for position, including a fascinating mixture of historic basement-dwellers and powerhouses: the Phoenix Suns, Memphis Grizzlies, Atlanta Hawks, Orlando Magic, Dallas Mavericks, Sacramento Kings, Brooklyn Nets, New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls. To be fair, the Nets are not tanking, since they do not control their first-round pick this year (still due to the Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett trade, incredibly). But the roster simply cannot win many games even when giving full effort.</p>
<p class="p2">The Suns, Grizzlies and Hawks have emerged as the worst of the worst, leaving the other teams to finish behind them in the lottery. Phoenix has a putrid 20-59 record, outpacing the 21-57 Grizzlies and 22-57 Hawks. The Suns have to be the favorites to come in last. Devin Booker, the team’s best player by a long shot, is sidelined with a hand injury, leaving rookie Josh Jackson to lead the rest of the bunch. Forward T.J. Warren can score, center Tyson Chandler can rebound and Jackson can do a little bit of everything on offense and defense. Besides them, however, the Suns have few average-level NBA players. Elfrid Payton, their point guard, cannot shoot in part because his long, pointed hair gets in the way of his arm and the ball (yes, this is real). Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss are already busts. The Suns surprisingly won their last outing against the Kings, breaking a 15-game losing streak, but it is safe to say that they will not enjoy much success from here on out.</p>
<p class="p2">The Hawks, in my opinion, could slide past the Grizzlies into second-worst place. Memphis has winnable games left against Sacramento and Detroit, but the Hawks face playoff teams for the rest of the season — in other words, sure losses. Atlanta’s top player, Dennis Schröder, is out with an ankle sprain for the rest of the season, forcing Taurean Prince, Kent Bazemore and rookie John Collins to step up. Unfortunately for the Hawks, Prince has shown that he can be explosive in scoring, with a pair of 38-point games last month. Atlanta may consider benching him if he plays too well on the court.</p>
<p class="p2">As mentioned above, Memphis has an easier schedule to end the season, which could spell trouble for their losing hopes. The Grizzlies boast the best player out of the NBA’s bottom three teams in center Marc Gasol. The 33-year-old can win a regular season game on his own, so Memphis has been reducing his playing time to stop that from happening. Gasol has not played more than 23 minutes in any of his last three games. Tyreke Evans is not playing either, as Memphis is perhaps the team most overtly tanking. But they cannot change their schedule, which could be their downfall.</p>
<p class="p2">While the bottom three teams have separated themselves, there is still plenty of competition for the other top lottery spots. The Dallas Mavericks pulled off an impressive loss against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night that helped their place tremendously. With Harrison Barnes (rest), Dennis Smith Jr. (knee) and Dirk Nowitzki (ankle) all off the court, the Mavs showed their commitment to the tank and have set themselves up for the fourth pick. Orlando must shake off their win and find a better way to limit the impact of Aaron Gordon. They should still finish in the top five, however. The Sacramento Kings have two clutch performers in De’Aaron Fox and Bogdan Bogdanović. But they’ve proven to be clutch a season too early and could cost the Kings’ position against the Nets. Brooklyn boasts some talent but falls apart at the end of close games. Chicago and New York, meanwhile, stand firmly above the rest of the tankers.</p>
<p class="p2">The next week could decide the future of the league, though no one will be winning a championship, a playoff series or even two games. But with nine teams all trying their hardest to lose, at the very least, it will be an interesting travesty to watch unfold.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Coming off a spring break victory over the University of California, Davis, the men’s tennis team returned to the Pizzitola Sports Center Friday for its first Ivy League test of the season. Bruno (14-7, 0-2 Ivy) kept a close match against Harvard (19-3, 3-0) but ultimately fell to the Crimson 4-3 after the visitors were able to clinch the winning point in fifth singles. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a pretty good showing considering last year’s results,” said Charles Tan ’19. “We had a really good chance, and it just kind of slipped away from us in the end.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The momentum initially swung in Harvard’s favor as the Crimson downed the Bears in first and third doubles to snag the first point of the day. But Brown showed no signs of surrender during singles play and evened the score to 1-1 after Charles Tan ’19 notched a 6-2, 6-3 victory in the fourth singles slot. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jack Haworth ’18 put up a fight in first singles and nearly pulled off a comeback with a 6-4 win in the second set to force a third before Harvard’s Kenny Tao sealed the final set to put the Crimson back on top. Peter Tarwid ’18 recorded a 6-4, 7-3 victory in third singles to tie the match for the second time, but Harvard came away with wins in second and fifth singles to bring up the final 4-3 score.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fifty-three miles away, the women’s tennis team was also trying to hold off the Crimson as the Bears (9-10, 2-1) hoped to keep a pristine conference record after they opened Ivy play with a spring break victory over Yale. But Harvard (11-8, 3-0) showcased strength and depth in singles play, sweeping five of the six matches to nab the 5-2 victory. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a pretty tough match,” said Devon Jack ’20. “Harvard has been pretty good the past two years, so we knew it was going to be a difficult match going in. … It just wasn’t our day.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno started off strong with doubles performances to take an early lead. Courtney Kowalsky ’21 teamed up with Maddie Stearns ’18 to defeat the Crimson 6-4 in the first spot while Juliana Simon ’20 and Katie Ta ’19 supported with a 6-2 win in third doubles to seal the point. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were really pumped (because) it had been a while since we won a doubles point that way,” Jack said. “All three teams fought hard and played really well. … We were trying to take that energy and adrenaline into our singles matches, but they stayed tough.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jack claimed the Bears’ lone win in singles with a 6-2, 6-1 win in the third slot, but three Bears forced their matches into extra sets. Alyza Benotto ’18, Stearns and Simon all pushed their opponents to a third set, but Harvard held on to win first, second and sixth singles matches en route to the 5-2 final score. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our team responded as well as we could have responded to a loss like that,” Jack said. “Losing to Harvard is tough because it’s Harvard and because we don’t have an Ivy League tournament or a conference tournament … so every match that we play throughout the month is extremely important because you don’t get a second chance. After that loss, we were devastated. But we responded really well to it.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both teams will be back in action next weekend against Penn. The women will return home to host the Quakers while the men will travel to Philadelphia for a chance to improve their records.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The baseball team earned its second shutout victory of the season with a 12-0 win over Princeton Sunday, after dropping two contests of a three-game series to the Tigers Saturday. With this weekend’s results, Brown (7-15, 3-6 Ivy) moves to seventh place in conference standings.</p>
<p class="p4">“Saturday, we faced two pretty good arms,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles. “We just obviously didn’t do enough offensively. We struck out 23 times in two games, (which) is not a recipe for offense by any stretch. (Sunday), we talked about coming out and not letting our circumstances dictate how we feel, but letting how we feel dictate our play.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Brown 4, Princeton 7</b></p>
<p class="p4">In the series opener, the Bears were resilient against the Tigers (7-13, 4-2) and stayed competitive to keep the game close. In the top of the sixth, Princeton jumped out to a 4-1 lead, but Brown responded in the bottom of the inning to tie the score. Second baseman Joe Lomuscio ’21 posted an RBI double, and designated hitter Calvin Farris ’20 knocked in two runs on a single for the equalizer.</p>
<p class="p4">The two Ivy League rivals entered the ninth tied at four, but the Tigers exploded for a three-run inning to down the Bears. Bruno notched seven hits compared to Princeton’s 11 and recorded one error.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Brown 3, Princeton 4</b></p>
<p class="p4">Later in the afternoon, Brown was again narrowly defeated by Princeton. Similarly to the previous game, the Tigers jumped out to another 4-1 advantage and earned a three-run lead in the top of the seventh frame. The Bears were able to put three men on base in the next half-inning, and Lomuscio and shortstop Willy Homza ’19 each recorded RBIs on sacrifice flies to bring the Bears to within one.</p>
<p class="p4">Brown could not complete the comeback in the final two innings, as Princeton’s effective relief pitching silenced the Bears’ bats. Bruno finished the game with seven hits, and starting pitcher Will Tomlinson ’20 struck out seven batters over 5.1 innings.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Brown 12, Princeton 0</b></p>
<p class="p4">The following day, Bruno came out of the dugout hot and did not cool down all afternoon. The Bears knocked in three runs in the bottom of the second to start the offensive barrage. Right fielder Hunter Carey ’18 recorded an RBI on a fielder’s choice sending third baseman Cameron Deere ’20 running across home plate. Homza then plated Farris to cross home with a powerful RBI double to widen the lead. Lomuscio capped off an impressive series and notched an RBI single into the center field gap for the third time in as many games.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’ve shown at times throughout the course of this spring that we’ve really been able to hit and play solid offense,” Achilles said.</p>
<p class="p4">In the bottom of the fifth, second baseman Rich Ciufo ’20, catcher Parke Phillips ’20 and starting pitcher Garett Delano ’20 loaded the bases with no outs. Deere then rocketed a grand slam into deep center field that sent the Brown dugout into a frenzy and gave the Bears an 8-0 lead.</p>
<p class="p4">“We needed a momentum swing right there,” Deere said. “We had been in that situation before and hadn’t gotten that big hit, and it has led to us ending up on the wrong side of the scoreboard later on.”</p>
<p class="p4">Moments later, Carey launched another home run to deep right field to bring home first baseman Mark Sluys ’19 and extend Bruno’s lead to ten runs.</p>
<p class="p4">Defensively, the Bears were sharp all day. In the top of the sixth, the Tigers had runners on first and third with one out, but Brown executed a perfect double play to preserve the shutout. Delano stifled Princeton’s offense throughout the contest and pitched six shutout innings with no errors to earn four strikeouts and help secure the victory.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’ve lost a lot in a row, so it feels good to execute pitches and give my team a chance to win,” Delano said. “Pitching with a lead sometimes gets tough because you don’t execute as you would in a tight ballgame. But it definitely felt good. We had twelve runs today, so it definitely took the pressure off.”</p>
<p class="p4">Sluys launched another home run in the seventh, and Phillips sent Lomuscio home with an RBI in the eighth to deliver Brown’s final two runs of the game.</p>
<p class="p4">“Our guys really came out and played well today,” Achilles said. “We were able to put together a good offensive day with some defense and a great start by (Delano).”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears will host interstate rival the University of Rhode Island Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. before playing another three-game series against Columbia this weekend at Murray Stadium.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Entering the weekend, the women’s lacrosse team hoped to secure its first Ivy League victory of the season against a No. 23 ranked Cornell team. The Bears (8-4, 1-3 Ivy) did just that, as a second-half comeback proved enough to down Cornell (6-5, 2-2 Ivy) in a nail-biter finish. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There was a lot of emotion and hype surrounding this game,” said Bri Irons ’18.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But the biggest thing going into (Saturday) was us focusing on Brown lacrosse … just really focusing on trusting each other, trusting our system.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown’s offense got off to a fast start, and opened scoring with back-to-back goals by first-year phenoms Risa Mosenthal ’21 and Maggie Fowler ’21 in the first three minutes of play. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cornell responded with a goal about two minutes later, which Emma Dahle ’18 answered to lengthen the Bears’ lead. Another point from Cornell set the game at 3-2 in favor of Brown with just under 22 minutes remaining in the first half. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next four goals were a Paletta family affair. Bruno earned the first point off a goal from Carolyn Paletta ’18,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>while the next two were scored by Carolyn’s sister and Big Red freshman, Grace Paletta. Not to be outmatched, Brown’s Paletta scored once more with 13:50 remaining in the period.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mosenthal found the back of the net under a minute later with her second goal of the game and gave the Bears a two-point lead. But Cornell trimmed the advantage by one with just over two minutes remaining in the frame.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A goal scored by Cornell with one second left in the period sent the teams into halftime at a 6-6 draw. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cornell controlled the first five minutes of the second half, and mounted a three-goal run to set the game at 9-6. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fowler responded for Bruno with a tally 30 seconds later. Paletta quickly followed, placing the Bears within one goal of the Big Red. But Cornell’s offense began to rally and scored four unanswered goals in about as many minutes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, Bruno found a way to bounce back in the final 18 minutes of the contest. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In the second half, we switched our defensive set to a zone, which was a really big (change), and (Cornell) didn’t score for 18 minutes. Mikaela Karlsson (’18) coming in and having five saves … those were super important for us,” Irons said. “You could tell we had this new confidence that I saw on the field. Even when we were down by five, we didn’t look like we were playing nervous.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Karlsson entered the contest with 18:37 remaining in the second half and proceeded to save all five shots that came her way for the rest of the game. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Bears’ offense found a rhythm after a goal from Zoe Verni ’19 with just under 17 minutes remaining. Paletta followed eight seconds later with a point, her team-leading fourth goal of the afternoon, and set the game at 13-10. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Emma DeGennaro ’20 and Caroline Zaffino ’19 followed with their first goals of the contest, and made it a one-point game with just under eight minutes left to play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Strong team defensive play continued to give the Bears’ offense opportunities to attack the goal. Verni tied the game at 13 apiece with 3:55 remaining, and Brown took the lead off a goal from Zaffino at the 2:18 mark.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Forcing a shot clock violation on Cornell, Bruno’s defense held on for the remainder of the game and secured Brown’s eighth win of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Overcoming a six-point deficit served as a testament to the team’s unity and composure, Mosenthal stated. “(We) dug deep and realized we had to take care of the ball and make sure we were protecting our defense with goals,” Mosenthal said. “It was … a full team effort — everyone really stepped it up at the end to secure the win.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mosenthal’s two goals on the afternoon extended her season total to a team-high 44. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Head Coach Keely McDonald ’00 also highlighted the team’s cohesion. “They stayed positive the whole time, really stayed centered (and) believed in themselves,” McDonald said after the game.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think it was just individual effort by each player to stay composed and stick with the game plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears finish the month of April with three more Ivy League games, with the next coming this weekend at Harvard. The team hopes to build on Saturday’s momentum going forward.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(We) definitely want to focus on playing at our standard and playing how we know we can, which we proved on Saturday against Cornell,” Mosenthal said. “I think we just need to focus on continuing to play at that level, and if we can do that we’ll definitely find success.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: The Angels will be a shocker playoff team</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In center field, they have the greatest player of this generation. At designated hitter, they have the greatest player of the last generation. And on the mound, they’ve got the coolest player of either. If you’re not excited about the Los Angeles Angels by now, then you must not be paying attention.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Baseball season is young, and a lot can happen in the next few months. But so far, everything we’ve heard and hoped about the Angels has come true. Mike Trout has mashed the ball, and is walking more than 10 percent of the time. Once his average returns to where it’s always been, he’ll relatively easily regain his spot as the best all-around player in baseball. Albert Pujols, in his aged wisdom, is batting .288. Andrelton Simmons, defensive wizard, is batting .365, Tyler Skaggs has pitched 16 innings in two starts and only allowed three runs and 35-year-old Jim Johnson has shown signs of resurgence, pitching to a 2.45 ERA out of the bullpen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Angels, in short, have all the characteristics of a shocker playoff team. Do they have superstars? Yes. Dependable role-players and sage veterans? Absolutely. Charisma and fun of a winner? It’s hard not to think so. And what’s more, we haven’t even touched on the Angels’ newest sensation, and America’s newest sweetheart.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When Shohei Otani allowed a single to Oakland Athletics’ shortstop Marcus Semien in the seventh inning last Sunday, it meant that he wouldn’t make major league history and become the 24th pitcher to throw a perfect game. But it’s hard to say that Otani was anything but brilliant. In his seven scoreless innings, he struck out 12 batters, and allowed only that one hit, along with a walk. This was after a week during which, despite some previous doubts about his swing, he hit home runs in three consecutive games. So far on the mound, Otani is 2-0 with a 2.08 ERA. At the plate, he’s batting .364/.417/.773 with three home runs. After Otani’s start against the Athletics, Alex Putterman of The Comeback pointed out on Twitter that Otani — in that moment — had more strikeouts than Max Scherzer and more home runs than Aaron Judge.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He was certainly impressive to baseball writers, many of whom had been less than dazzled by his mediocre spring. “He is the most exciting story in baseball and has been since opening day,” wrote the Wall Street Journal’s Jared Diamond on Twitter. “This is utter domination.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports wrote an entire column entitled, “Dear Shohei: I’m sorry. I was totally wrong about you.” Tim Brown, also of Yahoo Sports, wrote, “It’s becoming something. Maybe not a mania. … A spectacle. A curiosity. A hope.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Put it all together and what do you have? To me, it seems pretty clear. The Angels are becoming America’s team. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“America’s team” certainly isn’t a technical term, so what exactly does it mean? To give some context, the last time I can remember anything like it was during the 2014 playoffs, when baseball fans outside of San Francisco fairly unanimously rooted for the Kansas City Royals. After several dramatic victories, the Royals ultimately came up short against the Giants in the World Series. But what’s happening with the Angels is different, and far bigger. It’s easy to fall in love with a team like the Royals once the field has been narrowed down to eight or 10 in the playoffs, and most of those are hated rivals. But the Angels, with Trout and Otani and company, are on another level entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since Trout’s ascension to the major leagues in 2012, the Angels have failed to live up to the hype: They’ve made the playoffs only once, in 2014, and have only finished above .500 half the time. But this year, they’re off to a hot start. They’re 10-3, and lead the American League West by one game over reigning champions Houston Astros. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Predicting baseball is a fool’s errand — anyone can get hurt or traded, or just have a bad year. But based on the excitement we’ve seen coming from Angel Stadium, I’d pick the Angels to make the playoffs. And when they do, I’d say that most of America will be rooting for them.</span></p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Don’t sleep on Utah</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/13/klein-20-dont-sleep-utah/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NBA playoffs begin this Saturday, and the favorites of years past expect to contend for the championship once again. The Golden State Warriors, while stumbling down the stretch thanks to injuries, have the most talent by far when healthy — and star Stephen Curry should return before too long. The Cleveland Cavaliers struggled through an up-and-down season, but LeBron James remains the best player in the world and can still dominate the Eastern Conference. The Houston Rockets amassed an epic regular season with 64 wins and intend to defeat the Warriors in a possible Western Conference Finals clash. Bottom line, the vast majority of analysts will pick one of these three teams to take home the championship. But there is another team that could contend this season: the Utah Jazz.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the sports media world has not covered the Jazz to the same extent as it has the league powerhouses, Utah is on an incredible tear. On Jan. 22, the team possessed a 19-28 record — far out of playoff contention and headed for a lottery pick. Since then, the Jazz have gone 29-6 (yes, really), overwhelming the opposition with intense defense and quick offense. What changed for Utah? The return of Rudy Gobert from injury. Gobert is one of the most underappreciated players in the NBA — an annual Defensive Player of the Year threat who changes the game. Boasting a ridiculous 7’9” wingspan, Gobert protects the rim like no one else, recording 2.3 blocks per contest. He also adds verticality to Utah’s offense — always a threat for alley-oops.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, one cannot talk about the Utah Jazz without praising Donovan Mitchell. After the departure of Gordon Hayward last offseason, the Jazz were assumed to be in a rebuilding phase. But that all changed with the selection of Mitchell in the 2017 draft. The rookie has more than filled Hayward’s role on the fast track to NBA superstardom. The guard has averaged 20.5 points per game while drawing comparisons to Dwyane Wade, Russell Westbrook and a host of other elite players. He has tight handles and a speedy first step, and can attack the rim with great success or step back with a smooth crossover and jump shot. Don’t be surprised to see him dominating the playoffs over the next decade.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Jazz hold a lot of undervalued talent in addition to these two starters. Guard Ricky Rubio was heavily criticized for his failure to shoot the ball in Minnesota but has since improved in Utah, where he does not have to control the entire offense. A career 32.5 percent three-point shooter, Rubio hit on 34.9 percent of his shots outside the perimeter this season — his best mark ever. The 27-year-old made 40.2 percent of his threes after the All-Star break, as he continued to gain confidence from the outside. And many NBA fans have never heard of Joe Ingles, a small forward from Australia, but he adds important floor spacing for Mitchell. Ingles is shooting 43.9 percent from three, fifth in the league and ahead of names such as Kyle Korver, Curry and Kevin Durant. Jae Crowder struggled a lot in Cleveland but has improved since the Cavaliers trade, giving the Jazz strong defense at the wing positions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Utah can more than hang with the top teams in the league, blowing out the Warriors by an incredible 40-point margin on Tuesday night. While Golden State will surely mount a tougher fight with Curry on the floor, they should be afraid of the Jazz. After all, Utah still defeated them by 30 points back in January when Curry was playing. The Warriors and Jazz are trending in opposite ways, with Golden State playing its worst basketball in almost four years and Utah peaking at just the right time. The Jazz will still be underdogs if the two teams meet in the playoffs, but no one should underestimate their chances.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though many fans may not realize it, the Jazz have proven themselves to be a tier above the rest of the middling Western Conference playoff teams. No one in that group has mounted a hot streak even close to what Utah has accomplished, and the other teams all have significant deficiencies. The Portland Trail Blazers have too many mediocre forwards playing big minutes. The New Orleans Pelicans don’t have enough starter-level wings to pair with Anthony Davis. The San Antonio Spurs are missing Kawhi Leonard, who may not return for the playoffs, and even with Leonard on the court, San Antonio doesn’t possess enough above-average talent to make a deep push. Lastly, the Oklahoma City Thunder are inconsistent and low on depth — their bench is atrocious.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Jazz, however, are terrific in all facets of the game. They can win offensive races and defensive rock fights. A team this well-rounded and adaptable can match up with anyone. Utah has the ability to advance a lot further in the playoffs than anyone thinks.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Anna Seto ’18 delivered a strong performance for the equestrian team Saturday, collecting a pair of top two finishes in the Zone 1 Finals at Mount Holyoke College and qualifying for the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association National Championships. The qualification marks Seto’s second consecutive year riding at the highest level of collegiate competition. She finished first in the Intermediate Flat division and second in the Intermediate Fences division, both of which earned her a bid to nationals alongside teammate Dominique Carlo ’20, who qualified with a second-place finish in Walk-Trot.</span></p>
<p class="p1">For her performance, Seto has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Congratulations on qualifying for nationals! How does that feel?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">It feels really great! It’s awesome.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What divisions are offered for the team to compete in? What is your strongest?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The team is comprised of people from all different experience levels. There’s anything from Walk-Trot, which means you’ve pretty much never ridden before, to competing pretty extensively. I actually started in one of the lowest divisions, and I moved up by doing a lot of horse shows and placing out of divisions.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>How did you first get into equestrianism?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I read “The Black Stallion” in fourth grade, and I wouldn’t drop it. I love horses — I think they’re amazing. I started doing summer camp one summer, and then my parents agreed to do lessons every other week, and it progressed. I worked off a lot of riding, doing chores at the barn and things like that for riding time and lessons. I didn’t compete much in middle school and high school. It’s a really expensive sport, so that’s one thing that’s awesome about Brown. We’re varsity, so we’re funded. I didn’t think I would be able to ride in college at all, so that’s great. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Is it difficult to balance your academic and equestrian careers?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Our team commitments are weightlifting two or three times a week (and) our general team meetings. Then for our riding time, we do two lessons a week, which are three-hour time blocks. It’s different from a lot of sports, because it’s not like we show up to the barn and the whole three hours are riding — it’s a lot more of taking care of the horse, you have to brush the horse and get them ready. Our lessons are usually about an hour of riding, but in a three-hour time block to fit everything in. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What are your interests outside of riding and school?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I like reading, cooking and being outdoors in other ways. I really like hiking. I am a mechanical engineer, so the vast majority of my time is taken up with different classes and doing stuff with the team. On top of that, it’s just wherever I can find time to do something fun. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What are your plans for after graduation? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I am going to be interning over the summer at Planet Labs, which is a start-up satellite company in San Francisco. Then I’ll be coming back to Rhode Island and be working with Raytheon in the underwater and mine division in Portsmouth.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>In your opinion, what makes a good rider? What are your personal strengths? </b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Definitely mental control and confidence. A lot of times, people say that you win with your attitude going into the ring. I think that is something that a lot of people struggle with that I have gotten better at. Not to say that I’m perfect or anything, but improving that has been a big part of it. Also, the way we compete, we don’t know too much about the horses we are riding. It is a bit of an adaptability challenge, to be able to communicate with them and get them to do the things that you want them to do without having ridden them before. I rode a lot of lesson horses growing up. I didn’t have my own horse. Having a wide range of experience and being adaptable is super huge.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What have you enjoyed the most about being part of the equestrian team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I think that something it has really made me appreciate is actually the team concept of it. Riding is an individual sport everywhere else, other than collegiate. So having other people to support you and supporting other people is great. Having all the different levels of riders in one place is really rewarding — getting to see everyone progress, do better and learn.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Seto will compete at the IHSA National Championships beginning May 3 at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The baseball team was swept by Columbia at home this weekend and lost its first game Friday 8-2 before falling in both games of a doubleheader 5-4 and 2-0 Saturday. After the weekend’s contests, the Bears (7-18, 3-9 Ivy) move to seventh place in the Ivy League standings with just three conference series remaining in the season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Obviously we would have liked to have won at least one, much less take the series,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles. “(Columbia is) playing good baseball right now and we didn’t execute enough to beat them. (It’s) a tough weekend to walk away from, but I’m still proud of our guys and how they competed.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 2, Columbia 8</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the series opener, the Bears were outmatched by the Lions (12-20, 8-4) from the opening pitch. Although Brown recorded eight hits — including three from catcher Parke Phillips ’20 and an RBI from shortstop Willy Homza ’19 — the team could not score enough runs to keep up with Columbia’s explosive offense. Right fielder Joe Lomuscio ’21 notched the other RBI on a groundout to shortstop in the seventh inning. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the mound, Bruno had to dig deep into its bullpen and featured six pitchers in nine innings. The Bears gave up ten hits and six errors.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 4, Columbia 5</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To open Saturday’s doubleheader, the Bears jumped out to an early lead over the Lions but faded in the final innings. In the bottom of the fifth frame, Brown threatened when Homza, first baseman Hunter Carey ’18 and second baseman Rich Ciufo ’20 loaded the bases. Phillips then reached first base on an error by the Lions shortstop to send Homza and Carey across home plate. Soon after, the Bears again jammed the bases with a single, and center fielder Sam Grigo ’18 launched a two-RBI double to right field and brought Phillips and Ciufo home. The Bears’ clutch hitting in the inning extended their lead to 4-1.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were getting blanked before (the fifth inning), so obviously it’s good to help the team break through, break that seal and jump out in front,” Grigo said. “The rest of the day was a combination of their pitchers doing a really good job, a little bit of unluck for us, and then the wind. It was a tough combination this weekend, but their pitchers did a really good job.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the top of the seventh, Columbia lit up for three critical runs to tie the game. The Bears were unable to respond, and the teams entered the ninth inning tied at four. But with one out in the top of the ninth, Chandler Bengston reached third base to put the Bears in a jam, before Julian Bury bunted to bring Bengston home and give the Lions a crucial late lead. In the bottom of the inning, the Bears struck out twice and could not get on base to finish the loss.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 0, Columbia 2</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the series finale, both teams’ defenses came out of the dugouts ready to play, and each put up strong early performances on the mound. Starting pitcher Garett Delano ’20 set the tone for the Bears and allowed only four hits over seven innings with five strikeouts. Delano also notched Bruno’s first hit of the game with a single in the bottom of the fourth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I felt pretty good, but it doesn’t really matter,” Delano said. “We lost. We got swept. So we have to come back on Tuesday on our midweek and next weekend and play hard.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown loaded the bases in the bottom of the fifth with two outs but could not bring any runners home to continue the defensive duel. In the bottom of the sixth, the Lions earned a critical single that plated the first run of the day from either team and put the Bears at a deficit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Columbia carried its one-run lead into the ninth, as Bruno only managed to record three hits in the first eight innings. In the top of the ninth, the Lions knocked in an insurance run to extend their lead to two and put the game out of Brown’s reach. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re still in position where if we take care of our business and … we win, then that gives us a good chance to still be in competition at the Ivy League Championship Series, which has been our goal since day one,” Achilles said. “Just taking it one game at a time, and trying to execute as best as we can — that’s really our ultimate goal for the remaining games.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will take to the road for the rest of the month and will face Harvard in a three-game away series this weekend before visiting Siena College Tuesday, April 24. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The men’s lacrosse team faced off against No. 6 Yale Saturday and looked to find its third straight Ivy League win following victories over Princeton and Penn. But a powerful offensive attack from Yale (9-2, 5-0 Ivy) proved too much for Brown (5-5, 2-2), as the Bulldogs managed to put up 27 goals to the Bears’ 15. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yale opened scoring in the first minute of play, but the Bears responded strongly. Stephen Hudak ’18 put up back-to-back goals, which George Grell ’21 followed with another tally to give Bruno a 3-1 lead with 11:04 remaining in the first quarter. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bulldogs followed with a goal, which Jackson Newsome ’19 answered under a minute later, setting the game at 4-2 midway through the first. But Yale dominated the rest of the quarter and scored four straight to send the Bears into the second quarter down by two. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown found an offensive rhythm early in the second period. Michael Panepinto ’19 scored at the 14-minute mark, and a pair of goals from Newsome tied the game up at seven apiece.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In the first half our offense was playing pretty well,” Hudak said. “We knew we had to get shots in on that goalie early and try to get some momentum on our shots, and I think we did that well.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Bears’ offensive success was overshadowed by the Bulldogs’ offense, which went on a scoring rally late in the second quarter. Yale put away five goals before Luke McCaleb ’20 closed out scoring in the period with 50 seconds remaining, sending the game into the half 11-8 in favor of the Elis. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yale’s offensive prowess continued in the second half. The Bulldogs won all seven faceoffs in the third quarter and took advantage, outshooting Brown 24 to 5 in the period. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bulldogs scored twice before Newsome responded with a goal — his fourth point of the afternoon — for the Bears, and narrowed the deficit to four. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The rest of the third was all Yale, as Bruno’s defense struggled against the Bulldogs’ solid offense, which scored six straight goals. Yale carried the rally over into the fourth quarter, and added a pair of goals early in the final frame to gain a 21-9 advantage. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Bruno continued to fight. Newsome scored his fifth goal of the game, a career high, at the 11:53 mark. After two more goals from the Bulldogs, the Bears answered with two goals of their own, first from Jack Kniffin ’20, followed by Riley Stewart ’21. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yale scored twice more, setting the score at 12-25 with 3:32 left in the contest. Levi McCrady ’20 responded about fifteen seconds later with his first goal of the game. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After another pair of Bulldog goals, the Bears finished out the afternoon with two scores. Tom Hale ’21 found the back of the net, logging the first point of his college career. McCrady then scored once more, setting the game to its final score of 15-27.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The game was a tale of two halves, as Brown moved the ball well and put up points early on, but struggled to find an answer to Yale’s offense in the third and fourth quarters. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think the game just came down to a bunch of little plays,” said Carson Song ’19. “In the first half … we were making some of those plays, and in the second half they started making more of the little plays. Looking ahead, if we can focus on attention to detail and those little fundamentals … that’s the direction and the focus and we need to reemphasize.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a tough game against Yale, the Bears are looking forward to the opportunity to play crosstown rival Providence College Tuesday. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ll close the book on (the Yale game) relatively quickly,” Hudak said. “At this point in our season, we’ve got to worry about what we can control, and that’s just coming out and preparing for PC … It’s nice to just be able to play another game right away and keep moving forward.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think the best way to think about (the loss) is that our season is ahead of us. We’re focused on our team and the things we can do and improve on more so than anything else,” Song said. “There’s obviously things to learn from that game, but I think it’s important to move on and … prepare for Providence on Tuesday.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The next four games are all critical for the team, with matchups coming up against intrastate rivals Providence and Bryant and Ivy League foes Cornell and Dartmouth. The Bears face Providence College Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. at Stevenson-Pincince Field. Brown also remains in contention for a spot in the 2018 Ivy League tournament, which opens May 4 at Columbia.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A season-best performance on balance beam and career-high scores from multiple gymnasts elevated the gymnastics team’s final competition of the season, as it finished fourth in the second preliminary session at the 2018 USA Gymnastics Collegiate National Championships Friday. The Bears notched their second-highest team score of the season, a 193.825, but host Texas Woman’s University and Cornell claimed the top two spots to advance to finals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno sent three competitors to individual event finals. Regan Butchness ’18 finished seventh on beam with a 9.725 while Emma Hansen ’21 and co-captain Claire Ryan ’18 placed ninth and fourth on the uneven bars with scores of 9.750 and 9.800, respectively. All three gymnasts earned First Team USAG All-America honors, and Julia Green ’19 received Second Team honors on vault.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown also garnered recognition for academic achievements as 11 gymnasts were named USAG Scholar-Athletes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We knew that our goal all season was to make it to Nationals, and we were there to go big and have fun,” said Erin Howell ’20. “We had more than a couple people get season highs, and we had really, really great performances. It just showed that everything we worked for definitely paid off.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears opened the meet on bars where Caroline Warren ’21 posted a 9.650 in the leadoff spot. Career-high scores of 9.750 for Howell and 9.850 for Ryan looked to put Brown on track for a big finish on its first event, but mistakes in the last half of the lineup hampered Bruno’s marks. Hansen helped the Bears bounce back with a personal-best 9.875, generating some positive momentum going into the second rotation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the 2017 National Championships, Bruno struggled on the balance beam, managing only two hit routines and counting three sets with falls. But the Bears put the past behind them this year and nailed every routine, tallying a 48.900 on the event to tie a program record.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“People just came in and knew they had a job to do,” Butchness said. “A lot of that stems from our poor performance in the season opener. … I always reference back to that point (as) the lowest we could go. With all this work that we’ve put in and consistency that we have under our belt, watch how high we can go.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Green earned a 9.750 at the top of the lineup, and the scores built from there as Rose Domonoske ’21 scored a 9.800 to match her career high. Hansen and Cassidy Jung ’19 supported with scores of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>9.725 and 9.775, respectively, before beam specialist Butchness posted a personal-best 9.850 in the anchor position to bring up the Bears’ record total.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the near-flawless beam set, Brown kept the energy up on floor exercise as Kate Nelson ’21 kicked off the third event with a 9.575. Co-captain Maggie McAvoy ’18 and Anya Olson ’18 capped off their collegiate gymnastics careers with scores of 9.700 and 9.650, respectively. Green added a 9.800, and Anya Barca-Hall ’18 earned a 9.825 for her final collegiate performance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With one rotation left, Bruno closed out its season on vault. Nelson and Gabrielle Hechtman ’19 earned twin scores of 9.575, while Anne Christman ’20 followed with a 9.450. Green led the Bears with a 9.725, and Alyssa Gardner ’21 put up a 9.675 to conclude Brown’s 2018 schedule.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This year, we had this lightheartedness and passionate sense to the team which really worked to our advantage,” Butchness said. “We definitely started the season slow … but we ended on a very high note, and I don’t think anyone is upset. … We weren’t the caliber of the other teams to make team finals, but there were victories within our team that everyone is happy about.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last weekend, track and field athlete Carly Paul ’18.5 traveled to Alabama to compete in the Auburn Tiger Track Classic. Over the course of the two-day meet, she finished in first place in the women’s heptathlon with 5,509 points and set a new University record in the event. Paul’s score broke the 18-year-old standing record of 5,504 points set by Lindsay Taylor ’01 in 2000. She also won and set an additional Brown record in long jump with a 20’ 3.75” leap. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For her outstanding accomplishments in the heptathlon and long jump last weekend, Paul has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Herald: Congratulations on setting two school records last weekend! What was going through your mind before, during and after the meet?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Paul: The nature of the heptathlon is that you don’t get to do it every week, so I only do two heptathlons every outdoor season. This was the first one, and the second will be at our conference championship. Going into the first multi (event) of the season is always really exciting, but you try to stay calm because it’s early on. But I definitely knew I was shooting for a PR in the overall score and PR in the individual events within it. I think during this multi, I was definitely the most cool, calm (and) level-headed that I’ve been, and I think that really worked to my advantage. It was exciting to come back and see everyone, and people were pretty excited for me. I was the only one who went out to Alabama — I just went with my coach and everyone else was at a home meet here, so it was exciting to come back and see everyone. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>How did you initially get into track and field? Did you play other sports growing up?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was a dancer for a very long time, which I think has benefited me a lot with picking up different events (in track), and just having body awareness. I started doing track because my mom and aunt had hurdled and high jumped in high school. I tried that out because of them, and it just kind of stuck. I also played volleyball in high school too.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I really didn’t have my sights set on Brown until I was contacted by coach Ken (Hunt). After that it was really just my dream school. I was pretty set on Brown because I went on an official visit and I definitely liked the energy … I really liked the cooperative nature of it. I think it was definitely the best academically and athletically balanced opportunity that I had coming out of high school, and that was really important to me. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Who has been the biggest influence on your track career?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had a very good high jump coach in high school. His name’s Coach Square. He was just a really fun guy, really quite knowledgeable about the high jump, and really pushed me to be a be better athlete all-around and be a level-headed athlete. …(That) is one of the biggest skills you need and has helped me be successful at the multis.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Going forward, what are your team and individual goals for the rest of the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our women’s team has a lot of potential to do well as a team in our conference. In our indoor championship we kind of fell short of our potential — a lot of girls just missed finals and we had a couple people that were injured. We’re a very young team, so it’s just up from here. I think in the outdoor championships we have really high sights for our women’s team to place much higher in team rankings. As far as myself, breaking the heptathlon record was a really big goal for me. I just came short of breaking the pentathlon record in indoor, and so I definitely have my sights on that for this outdoor season. But my main goal is to make it to nationals in the heptathlon or in an individual event. I have regional qualifying marks for long jump and high jump, so maybe I can make it to one of those or the heptathlon.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What are your plans after graduation? Do you want to stay involved with athletics?</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I don’t know what I see myself doing immediately after college. My degree is in international development, so something in that. I’ve been thinking more often lately about coaching at some point in my future — I would love to coach maybe at a high school level later on in my life. I think track has made me value a really active lifestyle, so I’ll definitely continue to do outdoor stuff. Being from Colorado, I miss a lot of the hiking and biking and stuff I used to do in nature, so that’ll be a big part of my post-collegiate life. I could definitely see myself needing some form of competition — maybe that’ll translate into triathlons. Another thing I’d really like to do is go back to playing volleyball.</span></p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Which MLB frontrunners are legit?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Major League Baseball season is underway, and now, after a couple of weeks, some teams look surprisingly unstoppable. The Boston Red Sox came into spring training with plenty of attitude and team chemistry questions but have since raced off to a 15-2 start. The Los Angeles Angels, with the boost of Shohei Ohtani, currently stand with a 13-5 record. Meanwhile, in the National League, it’s 2015 all over again for the New York Mets — with dominant pitching, New York is in first place in the NL East with 13 wins and only four losses. But are any of these early season trends sustainable over the course of the year? Could these teams really be the league’s best?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Red Sox have the talent to remain at the top; Boston is the best bet of the three frontrunners to make a deep playoff run. Mookie Betts has more than bounced back from a down 2017 season. He has a .390 batting average and a 1.249 OPS thus far. Hanley Ramírez is a far more surprising comeback candidate. At the age of 34, his swing looks noticeably quicker and more compact, helping him amass a .912 OPS.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The pitching, of course, is the biggest story of Boston’s season so far. The staff as a whole currently holds a 2.66 ERA and 1.107 WHIP. While those figures are sure to regress, at the very least, they do show us that Boston’s pitching talent is finally performing closer to their collective potential. David Price struggled against the New York Yankees while battling a hand issue, but his other three starts were fantastic. He only allowed one run in 19 innings. Price, as Boston’s biggest wildcard, will have a major part in dictating the outcome of this season. Chris Sale, on the other hand, continues to dominate consistently. He has already struck out 31 hitters in only 22 innings, to go along with a sparkling 1.23 ERA. Rick Porcello looks like 2016 Porcello again, another welcome sight. Those three can form a dangerous postseason rotation if everyone performs as expected.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Mets are another team that can remain in contention all summer long. The rotation is healthy for the first time in three years, and the results speak for themselves. While health remains an obvious caveat, the Mets showed in 2015 that they can make a deep and successful postseason run.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom are performing up to expectations. Taking into consideration Syndergaard’s 13.92 K/9 ratio and deGrom’s 10.80 mark, it is evident that the Mets boast two of the game’s best strikeout artists. Zack Wheeler, finally back on the mound, surrendered only one run in seven innings in his first start of the season. He labored more in his second game, but it is good for New York to see him pitching respectably. Matt Harvey has dropped off big time, and there is talk of sending him to the bullpen. If Harvey can miraculously regain even a little bit of his peak form, this team can reach an even higher level of dominance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some members of New York’s lineup are definitely overperforming and should be in for some decline. Asdrúbal Cabrera won’t end up as one of the league’s best hitters with a .343 batting average and .996 OPS. Todd Frazier’s hack-filled approach will drag his on-base percentage far lower than his current .438 mark. With that being said, Yoenis Céspedes, Wilmer Flores and Jay Bruce have all gotten off to slow starts and should heat up soon. The net effect of regression will be minimal. And with that pitching rotation, the Mets don’t need incredible amounts of offense to compete.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Angels are the one team that I don’t believe in. To get this out of the way, Mike Trout is the best player in baseball. Nothing more needs to be said. However, Jefry Marté is not a .364 hitter, the bullpen is not one of the best in history and Ohtani is not Babe Ruth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ohtani’s start has been impressive though. After he struggled in spring training and some scouts claimed that he should start the year in the minor leagues, Ohtani has been proving doubters wrong from his very first pitch of the season. On the mound, he has a 0.80 WHIP and an 11.4 K/9 ratio. At the plate, Ohtani is hitting .367, with a 1.191 OPS and three home runs. In other words, the 23-year-old has been one of the best pitchers and hitters in the game. That won’t last — eventually, scouts will figure out his weaknesses and force him to adjust. But it has been a lot of fun to watch.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem with the Angels is a lack of depth. Ohtani will eventually hit the rookie wall at some point, and Los Angeles doesn’t have other above-average hitters with whom to surround Trout and Justin Upton in the lineup. Andrelton Simmons, Luis Valbuena and a more-than-washed-up Albert Pujols won’t scare anyone. Add in the inevitable regression of the bullpen and the Angels could face some tough times late in the season.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The baseball team had lost seven consecutive games and 16 of its last 17 contests before Sunday afternoon and was in desperate need of a victory against Ivy rival Harvard. After dropping the first two games of a three-game series against the Crimson (6-6 Ivy, 16-17) Saturday, the Bears (4-11, 8-22) were finally victorious with a 7-3 victory the following day. With the weekend’s results, the team falls to last place in the Ivy League standings, with just six more conference contests remaining in the season. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We certainly ended the weekend on a good note,” said Head Coach Grant Achilles. “It was a tough start to the weekend for us, facing a pitcher coming off of a no-hitter last weekend. We came out flat and didn’t play well at the start, but we certainly responded with a much better game two.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 1, Harvard 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the series opener, the Bears’s offense was stifled by impressive performances from the Crimson on the mound. Although Brown recorded six hits, the team was not able to make critical plays with runners in scoring position. Meanwhile, Harvard was able to capitalize during important at-bats, plating one run in the third inning and two in the fourth to take a 3-0 lead. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starting pitcher Collin Garner ’21 “and the guys that threw out of the bullpen came out and pitched great in game one, but (Harvard pitcher Noah Zavolas) had all his stuff working and shut our offense down,” wrote center fielder Sam Grigo ’18 in an e-mail to The Herald. “That’s baseball sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the top of the ninth, infielder Garett Delano ’20 was able to put a stop to the Crimson’s shutout bid with a home run to deep center field, but his moonshot was not enough to bring the Bears back into the game. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our only goal is to get back to playing the kind of baseball we know we’re capable of — like how we played against Cal and Florida A&amp;M early in the season,” Grigo wrote. “Things obviously haven’t gone the way we expected them to, but there’s still time to end on a positive note and build momentum for the program heading into next year.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 7, Harvard 8</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Later that afternoon, Bruno was handed a crushing walk-off defeat by the Crimson. Early in the contest, Harvard looked poised for another dominant performance, knocking in two runs in the first inning. But the Bears evened the score in the second with a two-run homer from right fielder Joe Lomuscio ’21.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I just tried to stay aggressive,” Lomuscio wrote in an e-mail to The Herald. “I saw the ball well and tried to be a tough out every time out there.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Harvard struck again with a three-run third inning, putting the Bears at a large deficit. Bruno stayed resilient and began to slowly trim the Crimson’s 5-2 lead, scoring a run in each of the fifth, seventh and eighth frames. But the Bears again had trouble generating clutch hits with runners in scoring position, as the team grounded into a bases-loaded double play to end the seventh inning. Bruno’s missed opportunity would prove costly later in the contest. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown entered the final frame at a two-run deficit, but the team delivered with timely hitting to tie the score. First baseman Hunter Carey ’18 managed to score on a groundout to cut the Crimson’s lead in half, and pinch hitter Brennan Vasquez ’21 capped the comeback with a two-out single. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But in the bottom of the ninth, the Bears were put on the ropes when Trent Bryan reached third base with just one out. Matt Rothenberg then recorded a pivotal hit to center field that brought Bryan home and gave Harvard the critical series victory. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Of course, the walk-off loss stings, especially after battling back late,” Lomuscio wrote. “We fought hard and have to move on and focus on winning every pitch.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 7, Harvard 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the series finale, the Bears jumped out to a quick advantage in the first inning when third baseman Cameron Deere ’20 brought Grigo home on an RBI single. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the top of the fifth, Bruno’s offense took control. Grigo launched a clutch home run to right field to send Lomuscio and Delano sprinting across home plate. At the end of the inning, Brown had extended its lead to four runs. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starting pitcher Will Tomlinson ’20 was exceptional on the mound for five shutout innings, giving up just three hits and striking out two batters. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Deere knocked in another RBI with a single in the seventh inning, and Grigo scored on a wild pitch to widen Brown’s lead to six and secure the critical victory. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s one of those times where you’re really proud of your team and how they respond,” Achilles said. “(Tomlinson) gave us a great start, and the bullpen did a good job coming back as well. To get the extra cushion with Grigo’s home run and then to tack on late as well after Delano hit the leadoff triple — that was very positive for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will stay on the road this week, traveling to Albany to play Siena College Tuesday before facing Dartmouth in another three-game series over the weekend. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro ’19: New England, enjoy it while it lasts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As I sit down to write, the Boston Red Sox have just been no-hit by Sean Manaea of the Oakland Athletics. But the setback is minimal. The Red Sox are still 17-4: They have the best record in baseball and lead their division by four games. For Boston, just about everything is clicking. Twenty games into the season, their lineup and pitching rotation are running like finely-tuned machines, and they show every sign of continuing to play like frontrunners. Meanwhile around the region, the Boston Celtics are in the midst of a first-round playoff series against the Milwaukee Bucks, a series they have every chance to win. The Boston Bruins lead their playoff series against the Toronto Maple Leafs 3-2. And the New England Patriots’ loss in Super Bowl LI has yet to fade from memory. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Considered all together, these events lead me to ask a simple question, one which New Englanders should consider during this period of sporting prosperity. Do New England sports fans know how good they’ve got it?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s on display this season, of course, but New England’s sporting success goes back much further. Since the turn of the millennium, the Bruins have made the playoffs 12 times and won a Stanley Cup. The Celtics have made the playoffs 14 times and won an NBA championship. The Patriots, of course, have made the playoffs 15 times since 2000, including every year since 2008 and have emerged victorious from five out of the eight Super Bowls in which they’ve appeared. And the Red Sox, in the same time frame, have made the playoffs nine times and won three World Series.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All in all, this has almost certainly been the most successful two-decade athletic stretch for one single region in history. And it has certainly won me over. Except for when they take on my New York teams, I root for New England teams whenever they play. I even support the Patriots, though, as a Jets fan, I’m supposed to regard them as bitter rivals. So I’ve enjoyed this period of prosperity almost as much as true-blue Boston fans have. But as an objective observer, I’ve also been able to reckon with a hard truth: It won’t last forever. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take it from me. I am a fan of the New York Mets, Jets, Rangers and Knicks. I watched the Rangers collapse in slow motion this very season: After a long run of playoff appearances over the past few years, including an appearance in the Stanley Cup Final, the 2018 Rangers fell victim to injuries and age and finished 34-39-9. The Jets have been similar — they’ve looked championship-bound several times, but it has never worked out. Chad Pennington, Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith, Ryan Fitzpatrick — a few of the Jets quarterbacks since 2000 who were supposed to lead us back to greatness, but ended up falling far short of expectations. The Knicks: Carmelo Anthony! Amar’e Stoudemire! Jeremy Lin! Kristaps Porzingis! We’ve had players that most teams can only dream of, yet somehow, it just hasn’t come together.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And then there are the Mets, who over the last few years have provided an almost perfect case study in what the Red Sox could be if their luck was just a little bit worse. The Mets have all the pieces: Pitchers Zack Wheeler, Steven Matz, Addison Reed and Rafael Montero; promising young hitters Brandon Nimmo, Juan Lagares and Dominic Smith; and established veterans David Wright, Lucas Duda and Neil Walker. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Except it didn’t quite work out. Wright is on the disabled list, perhaps for the rest of his career. Walker, Reed and Duda were traded away when the team faltered behind them. Nimmo and Lagares are stuck on the bench behind higher paid, lesser performing veterans. Smith and Montero are stuck in the minors; Wheeler and Matz have been oft-injured and so far have failed to live up to their immense potentials. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why are these failures important? Because they are all part of the normal course of running a baseball team, but the Red Sox have been able to avoid them for years. Sure, they’ve had setbacks, but it’s been a long time since a Boston team has suffered a truly devastating blow, the kind that tears a team down for a generation. Andrew Benintendi could lose his swing, or Hanley Ramirez’s power could abandon him. Mookie Betts could lose his speed, and with it, the Sox’s perennial playoff competition. It could be anything, and that’s the point. Maybe it won’t even be the Red Sox. Maybe it will be the Bruins, or the Patriots, or the Celtics, or all of them. Anything can happen in sports, and sooner or later, it will. I won’t enjoy it when the inevitable large-scale setback does occur: As I’ve said, I’m a fan of Boston teams, even the ones I’m supposed to dislike. But nevertheless, it has to happen eventually.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This may seem like a doomsday message, but it’s not. It’s a call to action and to emotion. New England, enjoy it while you can. Savor every moment that the Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics and Bruins are dependable playoff teams, and each year, give their fans a decent chance at a championship. Sure, great teams are fun to watch while they’re still great, and it’s easy to get swept up in the victories. But take it from someone who has seen greatness slip through a team’s fingers. Once it’s gone, you’ll miss it more than you can imagine.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Cleveland Browns are going to be on the clock and under the microscope next Thursday. While the front office wants to build its team and do what’s best for the franchise, one goal likely remains in the back of management’s mind: Don’t draft a bust.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cleveland has control of the first and fourth picks in the draft this year. While this seems an advantage, the Browns’ position comes with great expectations. To be sure, the names of Tim Couch, Johnny Manziel, Trent Richardson and Brandon Weeden still haunt the franchise. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the label “bust” has been firmly affixed to these former first rounders, it’s not a coincidence that these players so disproportionately end up in Cleveland. It may in part be due to Cleveland’s lack of ability to evaluate talent, but I think it’s more complicated than that.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rather than a skill evaluation problem, busts are often a result of an inability to develop talent once a player enters the league. To be sure, there is no “bust-gene.” Upon entering the NFL, no player is destined to fail. And while scouts and general managers seek to ascertain which players are most likely to pan out, practically all of the first-round picks in the draft are incredibly talented football players who have the potential to be successful in the NFL.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In football, it’s easy to blame players for poor on-field performance. When a quarterback tosses a pick, or a linebacker misses a tackle, people notice. But what we don’t see is the tremendous organizational aptitude or ineptitude that largely determines a player’s success.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When evaluating a young player who is new to the league, it is crucial to examine one’s context in order to properly assess ability. A player who is labeled a “bust” after poor performances often lacks the organizational luxury of skillful teammates, mentors and patient coaches. A bust could be somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the order of the draft is such that the worst teams get the best draft picks. Thus, the most promising young players may find themselves in situations not quite conducive to success.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Such was the case for Jared Goff in 2016. The Rams sold the proverbial farm in order to move to the number one spot in 2016 draft to select him. After a lackluster first season of limited work in which Goff threw five touchdowns to his seven interceptions, cries of bust began to echo around the LA colosseum. But the Rams refused to hit the panic button, and they doubled down on their young signal caller. Rather than yanking him and starting anew, the Rams hired a new coach — Sean McVay —who changed the team’s culture. This past year, Goff threw the same number of picks and ratcheted up his touchdown number by 22 in more than twice as many games, and thereby cemented himself as the future of the franchise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Rams could have written off Goff as a bust and moved on. But rather than making rash conclusions about his ability, they adapted and put him in a place to succeed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the Browns will acquire some talented players next Thursday, no 21-year-old will be the panacea for a team that has earned only one win in the past two seasons. And if a young player does not succeed in a culture that has fostered so much failure over the years, he should not be derided as a bust. He might just be a victim of circumstance.</span></p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Watch out for the Pelicans</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">The NBA playoffs have featured a number of surprises thus far — the Washington Wizards have played the Toronto Raptors in a close contest, the Utah Jazz have thoroughly outmatched the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Cleveland Cavaliers have struggled to overcome the Indiana Pacers. However, the biggest shock of the past week was the way in which the New Orleans Pelicans dominated and demolished the Portland Trail Blazers. After DeMarcus Cousins went down with a season-ending injury, many wrote off the Pelicans as a likely first-round exit. Instead, New Orleans swept Damian Lillard and company in four games, sending the Portland team into freefall. While Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts hopes to retain his job (as of Tuesday night), the Pelicans are moving on to face the Golden State Warriors in the second round. And though the Warriors should be heavy championship favorites, New Orleans could play them tougher than anyone expects.</p>
<p class="p3">First of all, the Pelicans have Anthony Davis. The 25-year-old is a top-five player in the league and just completed his best season yet. He averaged 28.1 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game — good for a 28.98 PER. Davis will be a special problem for the Warriors by virtue of his size. Golden State cannot stick Draymond Green on Davis all the time like they would have done against other star players because Davis can outmuscle and outleap him to a horrifying extent. Kevin Durant could match up against the big man, but Durant doesn’t like to be hit and jostled down low in the post. Fatigue from all that contact will be an issue because of his skinny frame. That leaves the likes of JaVale McGee, Zaza Pachulia and Kevon Looney to contend with Davis for a solid part of each game. He should be all over the offensive glass and punish the Warriors from there. Davis is averaging 33 points and 11.8 rebounds per playoff game — expect similar production from him going forward.</p>
<p class="p3">Jrue Holiday, meanwhile, has turned into a dangerous two-way threat that could neutralize Klay Thompson. Holiday’s star stock has risen with each New Orleans victory, and Game 4 against the Trail Blazers — when he scored 41 points and added eight assists — was his finest performance yet. Holiday is a dynamic scorer who can create his own shot. He spent the early part of his career running point for the Philadelphia 76ers and now can help run the offense from the shooting guard position. Between him and Rajon Rondo, the Pelicans have two lethal ball handlers. And Holiday’s defense might be the best part of his game. He overwhelmed Lillard and C.J. McCollum, forcing them to turn the ball over and take difficult shots.</p>
<p class="p3">Rondo has turned into full-blown “Playoff Rondo,” and the results speak for themselves. He averaged 11.3 points, 13.3 assists and 7.5 rebounds per game in the Portland series, with complete effort on both ends of the floor. His passing ability remains one of the best in the league and his basketball IQ is incredible. Rondo, on several different occasions last series, recognized the exact play Portland was about to run and positioned his teammates accordingly to halt the Trail Blazer offense. If the point guard continues to hit on his three-pointers, New Orleans has a complete, high-level playoff starter.</p>
<p class="p3">So, if New Orleans continues to play well, Davis can match Durant’s production, while Holiday can match Thompson’s and Rondo can match Green’s. The role player advantage belongs to New Orleans as well, with Nikola Mirotic, E’Twaun Moore and Solomon Hill making up the supporting cast.</p>
<p class="p3">But one name, of course, is missing from that equation: Stephen Curry. If the point guard returns from his knee injury at 100 percent effectiveness, then this series will be over quickly. Curry changes the game for the Warriors. The threat of his three-point shooting spaces the floor, his quick cuts promote ball movement and throw the defense further off balance and his ability to make a shot from anywhere can spark runs at any time. Without Curry, Golden State relies on iso ball with Durant, making life tougher for their shooters. The Warriors are still a great team without Curry, but beatable.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No one knows for sure when Curry will return. Different rumors have set a Curry return for the beginning, middle and end of the second round. It’s the key question of the playoffs because it could mean the difference between a sweep and a competitive six- or seven-game series. Furthermore, we can’t assume Curry will return at complete effectiveness. After all, in 2016, he returned from a more minor meniscus injury with noticeable problems. The Warriors struggled to overcome the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals and lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals after a 73-9 regular season.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Of course, the Warriors do have Durant now. But the Pelicans still pose a definite challenge for Golden State. With tough matchups, great ball movement and momentum, New Orleans can play the Warriors close.</p>

		<title>Anderson ’18 selected by the New York Yankees in MLB Draft</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid Anderson ’18 will be trading in his brown, red and white jersey for pinstripes next season, as the senior right-handed pitcher was selected by the New York Yankees in the 40th and final round of the MLB draft last Thursday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly, at this point right now, it’s still pretty surreal,” Anderson said. “I still don’t think it has really hit me yet, but I couldn’t be happier.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson was a consistent weekend starter for the Bears in his first three seasons with the team, though his senior campaign was cut short after he had Tommy John surgery March 30.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s kind of like a roller coaster of emotions for me,” Anderson said. “I wasn’t exactly sure what was going to happen with the whole Tommy John surgery because a lot of teams tend to stray away from kids who get surgery in the year of the draft.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Anderson led Bruno with 41 strikeouts over seven starts on the mound, and helped carry the team to a critical win against Penn when he notched a season-high eight strikeouts over five innings. Throughout his four seasons at Brown, Anderson recorded 130 total strikeouts. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Head Coach Grant Achilles was impressed with Anderson’s work ethic, and said that “all of the hard work that (Anderson) put in over the last 18 months showed that he was able to be the player that (the Yankees) think can be a professional pitcher.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Achilles added that Anderson was known for his leadership.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the weightroom and on the field, his development skyrocketed,” Achilles said. “He was able to show the guys what hard work was.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson is now the fourth Brown baseball player in three seasons to be selected in the MLB draft, following Austin French ’16, who went to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2016, and Christian Taugner ’17 and Rob Henry ’17, who were both drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“A big part of what our development focuses on is trying to prepare our players, regardless of career, for life after College Hill,” Achilles said. “The fact that we’ve had multiple players drafted over the past several years has really been an encouraging sign of the commitment that our players have shown to development (and to) the level of athletic abilities that our recruiting coaches have brought to our team.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson garnered attention from scouts when he played for the New England Collegiate Baseball League’s Newport Gulls last summer, an opportunity he described as “an awesome experience.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For Anderson, the next step in the process is to continue to rehab in order to play in the Yankees’ minor league farm system.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been rehabbing in the minor league facility in Tampa for the last week,” Anderson said. He will soon return home, where he will continue to rehab his elbow until August, when he will join the Yankees. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just need to get healthy, and (the Yankees) will decide what do with me around the spring,” he said.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Why the Red Sox won’t win the World Series</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Boston has certainly enjoyed a special summer of baseball, the title of this column notwithstanding. Mookie Betts and J.D. Martinez are both worthy MVP candidates, Chris Sale has dominated and even David Price finally looks like something close to his old self. The Red Sox currently own a sparkling 97-44 record, good for a nine and a half game lead in the American League East over the New York Yankees, who have the second-best record in the majors. With that said, in spite of all the positivity, the Red Sox have clear weaknesses that can be exploited once they reach the postseason. Don’t be surprised to see another early exit in the playoffs for the Red Sox.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First of all, Boston’s lineup is horrendously unbalanced. Betts, Andrew Benintendi, Martinez and Xander Bogaerts make for a fearsome combination that can end games in the first inning. But after that, the situation gets murky. First baseman Mitch Moreland occupied the third spot in Boston’s lineup for most of the season, often to the chagrin of fans. He is now dropping rapidly in the depth chart, only hitting for a .193 batting average and .593 on-base plus slugging in the second half. Infielder Eduardo Núñez has also disappointed, along with Rafael Devers and Jackie Bradley Jr. Brock Holt won’t scare anybody at the plate in October, nor will any of Boston’s catchers, the underwhelming trio of Sandy León, Christian Vazquez and Blake Swihart. Admittedly, the Red Sox have made some nice additions to the roster with the likes of Steve Pearce, Ian Kinsler and now Brandon Phillips. Yet the point remains — Boston’s lineup drops off massively after that first four.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But why does this matter? If Betts, Benintendi, Martinez and Bogaerts can create four runs on their own each game, then who cares about the rest?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The trouble comes with the nature of postseason baseball. Against the Chicago White Sox or Miami Marlins, the Red Sox can easily overwhelm with the offense at the top of the lineup. The rest of the order simply has to do the bare minimum. But runs are tougher to come by in the postseason, especially in the later rounds, when a team faces a different high-level starter every game. Fans saw a glimpse of this possibility in a late August four-game split against the Cleveland Indians. The Red Sox were not able to dominate a playoff-caliber team from the beginning and were forced into higher pressure, 50-50 situations. Players like Vazquez and Bradley Jr. will be huge negatives at the plate in October. If Moreland can’t hit against the Baltimore Orioles, what will he do when facing Justin Verlander?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 2017 Houston Astros established the precedent for the kind of lineup that wins the World Series in today’s game. It requires above-average hitters all the way up and down the order. The Astros may have boasted stars like José Altuve, George Springer and Carlos Correa, but they also had guys such as Alex Bregman, Marwin Gonzalez, Yuli Gurriel and Josh Reddick. The Red Sox simply do not have the same kind of starting lineup depth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another issue with this Boston team is the pitching. The ability to shut down an opposition’s offense for long stretches of time becomes vital in the postseason. Do Boston’s pitchers have that level of dominance within them?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chris Sale has pitched like the best starter in the American League when on the mound this season, but he has spent a good amount of time on the disabled list with shoulder issues. While it is easy to shrug at DL stints as a way for the team to rest the lefty, this is yet another bump in the road for a pitcher who has a history of tailing off in September and October. It’s not a foregone conclusion that Sale will be his usual self in October. Meanwhile, David Price’s postseason struggles are well-documented, Rick Porcello is inconsistent and the bullpen has been spotty, especially Joe Kelly and Matt Barnes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Indians and the Astros both have rotations better suited for postseason play. Cleveland can start Corey Kluber, Carlos Carrasco and Trevor Bauer (assuming Bauer returns from injury on schedule). Houston, meanwhile, will throw Verlander, Gerrit Cole, Dallas Keuchel and Charlie Morton. Both rotations surpass Boston’s, and the Red Sox’s back half of the lineup won’t give the team many chances to strike.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This edition of the Red Sox feels eerily similar to the 2001 Seattle Mariners. Those Mariners recorded the most wins in Major League Baseball history (tying the 1906 Chicago Cubs) with a record of 116-46, and appeared poised to march to a championship. But Seattle lost to the Yankees in the American League Championship Series in five games. The Red Sox have a good chance of succumbing to the same fate — a loss to a capable American League team in the playoffs.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I have one friend who is an enormous soccer fan, and for the longest time I didn’t understand what his passion was all about. I am a baseball fan above all else, partly because it is the greatest game in the world, but also because I am an American. Moreover, soccer doesn’t have as much of a presence in the United States as it does in other parts of the world. The overblown, stars-and-stripes colored bubble that I occupied meant that for much of my life, I regarded soccer as beneath my interests as a sports fan.</p>
<p class="p2">This all started to change when I saw the United States’ performance in the 2014 World Cup. Placed in what some called “The Group of Death,” the United States advanced out of the group stage but lost to Belgium in the round of 16. I was angry about the loss but even prouder of the U.S. team, and above all, excited about soccer for the first time in my life. It wasn’t until two years later, though, that I finally understood my friend’s passion. This was in the wake of the 2016 Copa América when the United States lost in the semi-finals to Argentina. I got so excited about soccer after that tournament that I went home and became a fan of the English Premier League. I am entering my third season supporting Chelsea and I can tell you: being a soccer fan is a worthwhile endeavor.</p>
<p class="p2">Why is it worthwhile? There are a few reasons. For one, the game is very likely on the upswing. Most casual observers know that soccer hasn’t quite caught on in the United States the way baseball, basketball or football have. There are several reasons for this. Obviously, we have never won a World Cup nor have we come particularly close. American professional soccer has not caught up to its foreign competitors. Nevertheless, we will get better. Armed with a new roster and a new coach after the sacking of head coach Jurgen Klinsmann, the U.S. Men’s National Team will likely qualify for the 2022 World Cup, which will bring fresh interest to the sport. Then, of course, the U.S. will play its part in hosting the 2026 tournament, which will shine an even brighter light on the game.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But even aside from the World Cup, soccer is simply a fun sport to follow. Major League Soccer, the highest league of American professional soccer, may not be the highest quality league in the world. But that doesn’t stop me from wearing my New York City Football Club jersey on match days, with David Villa’s number 7 on the back (I used to wear Frank Lampard’s number 8, but then he retired. I am thankful that, for at least one season, I had the privilege of watching a Chelsea legend play for my team). Likewise, on Chelsea match days, I’ll probably wear my bright yellow Chelsea jersey. You could do the same. Find a team, watch their matches (most are available to stream online, completely legally) and be a fan. I chose Chelsea because Alex Rider, the titular character of a children’s book series that I used to read, supported them, but make your own choice. Choose a team for its history. Its cool uniforms. Its charismatic star player. I chose for a far less compelling reason, and the next day I was watching a match and jumping off the couch as Eden Hazard and Diego Costa scored on the way to a 2-1 win over West Ham United Football Club.</span></p>
<p class="p2">There are a few reasons why soccer is so much fun to follow. There’s the game itself: as a sport, soccer is almost unrivaled in combined action and athleticism. All the pitiful arguments I used to make against the sport have fallen apart now that I actually watch the matches. There is plenty of action, scoring is perfectly paced and there is rarely a dull moment. Perhaps most importantly, play continues uninterrupted by commercials for 45-minute stretches. Talk about breaking out of a bubble — there are no TV timeouts during either half of a soccer game, and it’s a joy to experience.</p>
<p class="p2">But there’s more than the games. There’s also the sense of global connection that soccer brings, being the world’s most popular sport. I can watch or talk soccer with almost anyone and share a unique connection over a sport that most of the world loves. I, for one, know that soccer has helped pull me out of my star-spangled bubble and given me a greater appreciation for sports on the global scale. How do I know this? My new favorite player, Eden Hazard, was on the team that eliminated the United States from the 2014 World Cup. I don’t even harbor any resentment for our defeat at his hands: I just sit back and watch him score goals for Chelsea, and wait for the next World Cup, because I know that I am a fan of the world’s game now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nugent &#039;21: MLB’s playoff system needs to be fixed</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baseball loves to laud itself for meritocratic policies, from a grueling 162 game season that exposes any weakness and only rewards true quality, to the extensive minor league system that provides easy replacement for any player not making the grade. But some of the postseason policies that Major League Baseball has implemented in the last 25 years in the name of that meritocracy have failed to truly reward the best teams. This dissonance stems from one fundamental aspect of the current postseason system that flies in the face of competitive logic: that winning a division can matter more than a team’s record, and determine home field advantage. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now, winning a division isn’t easy, particularly in the six-month slog that an MLB team endures. But certain divisions are much easier to win than others, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>winners of less competitive divisions should not be rewarded with home field advantage over wild card teams with better records. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The current American League wild card race provides a perfect illustration of how this system falls short. If baseball season ended today, the playoff system would hurt a better team while bringing the added economic benefits and competitive edge of extra home games to a city with only a middle of the pack team.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Cleveland Indians are not a bad baseball team, and they will deserve the division crown they are going to win. They have perennial MVP candidates in Francisco Lindor and Jose Ramirez, and a rotation with past Cy Young winner Corey Kluber and current Cy Young contender Trevor Bauer. When healthy, their bullpen can go toe-to-toe with the best in the league. The Indians’ winning percentage, though, is not only lower than the other two division leaders in the American League, but also lower than the two wild card teams, the Yankees and Athletics, who would face each other in a one-game elimination playoff if the season ended today. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Because of MLB’s present format, beyond the Indians being spared the luck-susceptible one and done wild card game, they would escape a matchup with this year’s juggernaut Red Sox who hold the league’s best record. Worse still, if the Indians advanced to the League Championship Series, they might face a wild card team that was fresh off defeating the league’s best regular season team and holding a better record than Cleveland. But despite this, it would be the Indians enjoying home-field advantage. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The wild card game and the entrance of at least one team from every division still hold merit in protecting smaller markets’ postseason chances. But MLB can take an easy, concrete step towards a more fair postseason by reseeding teams according to regular season record with each round, rather than giving preference to division winners. We shouldn’t have to see a team that wins 90 games playing host to one that won 100: it simply isn’t fair.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Only exacerbating the current format is the simple fact that not only is winning those 100 games harder than winning 90 games, but that winning 90 games in the American League East or West is harder than doing the same in the Central. MLB’s insistence on weighted, division-heavy scheduling simply makes the field of play unfairly difficult in some divisions compared to others. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By the end of the season, the Yankees and the Athletics will have played the Red Sox and the Astros, the leaders in their respective divisions, nineteen times. The Indians will play each of these teams six times all year, while the Yankees and Red Sox will see each other six times in September alone. Cleveland, meanwhile, plays more than a third of its total games against the White Sox, Tigers and Royals, who would be the three worst teams in the American League if not for Baltimore’s historic bout of losing this year. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The win total that will bring Cleveland their division crown is lower than the one that will bring two teams a mere wild card berth. It also hasn’t come loaded down with the hard-fought wins against teams in a division with three teams above .500. In the Central, Cleveland is the only team with a winning record, having beaten up on four losing teams in various phases of rebuilding. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s not like baseball is any stranger to this type of postseason format change either. The addition of one wild card spot in 1994 and then another in 2012 went a long way to make sure teams like this year’s Yankees and Athletics don’t get snubbed an invitation to the dance completely. But giving home field advantage to division winners over teams with better records is misguided. On top of that, baseball has already fixed the indefensible practice of the All Star game deciding World Series home-field advantage by reinstituting a record-based system. This should be the same kind of no-brainer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If baseball truly wishes to institute a meritocracy in its postseason, this year’s Indians should play mostly on the road, and wild card teams should be granted what they earn in the regular season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Indians are not a team that should be hosting a playoff series. At most, they should be a team with a chance at an underdog run against better opposition. Instead, they are going to be the number three seed in the American League playoffs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So much for meritocracy.</span></p>

		<title>Men&#039;s soccer eclipse Colonials in overtime with golden goal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Following a season-opening victory against Ocean State rival Bryant University, the men’s soccer team defeated George Washington University 2-1 in overtime Friday. The Colonials stormed back in the second half to tie the game and put the Bears on the ropes, but midfielder Rodrigo D’Andrea ’20 ended the contest with a golden goal just three minutes into overtime.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a good game, and I thought we played well from the start,” D’Andrea said. “We created a lot of chances and could have put them away a bit earlier, but obviously everything worked out in the end.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both teams’ offenses took a few minutes to settle into the game. But Daniel Schiller ’20, who scored the game-winning goal against Bryant (0-4-1) last week, put the Bears (2-1) on the board in the tenth minute. Schiller intercepted a weak pass and pushed the ball toward the goal box before finding<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John Vrablic ’21, who launched a low shot toward the goal that could not be controlled by GW’s (2-3) goalkeeper. Schiller capitalized on the mistake and was able to give Bruno an early lead. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It feels amazing to be able to get the goal that gets us in front,” Schiller said. “The goals feel great, but we’d rather win by bigger margins. And there’s more to come in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moments later, Schiller again intercepted a pass and launched a shot but was contained by the Colonials for a goal kick. Throughout the first half, Bruno was able to pierce through the GW defense and created several offensive opportunities. Toby Howell ’19 knocked a header in the 20th minute that barely sailed wide, and Nathan Plano ’21 earned an open shot in the 26th but was ultimately called offsides. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the other end of the field, the Bears’ defense, assisted by rookie goalkeeper James Swomley ’22, stymied the Colonials and did not allow a shot until the 37th minute. GW midfielder Max Holdsworth managed to wrestle his way through the Brown defense in the 41st minute to create an open shot, but the ball edged left of the net to keep the Bears in front. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At halftime, Brown held a slim one-goal lead, but outpaced the Colonials in both shots on goal and corner kicks, each by margins of 4-0. </span></p>
<p class="p2">GW came out of the locker room much more aggressively in the second period and occupied the Bears’ zone for much of the first few minutes. But Bruno’s defense was able to hold back the Colonials’ surge and regain momentum. In the 51st minute, D’Andrea missed two promising shots on net, and Schiller wasn’t able to put a close one-on-one shot away in the 53rd.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jackson Goebel ’20 managed to sneak through the defense on a corner kick in the 63rd minute and force a clean header mere feet from the net, but the shot was powerfully knocked away by GW’s netminder. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the 71st minute, the Colonials tied the game on their first shot on goal of the match when Joshua Yurasits corralled a crossing pass and placed the ball past the reach of Swomley in the top right corner of the net. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Neither team could capitalize on scoring opportunities and break the tie in the final minutes of regulation, and the game went into to overtime knotted at one. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the extra period, the Bears were the more aggressive team from the start, launching a few off-target shots on goal to break the ice. Just three minutes into overtime, D’Andrea pushed the ball deep into the Colonials’ territory, shook off a defender and sent a low shot toward the bottom right corner of the net for the game-winning goal. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It feels amazing,” D’Andrea said. “But now we are on to the next game.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For the past two years we’ve had similar starts where we come out really hot,” Schiller said. “This year, we’re looking to keep this streak going for a while so we don’t have a dip halfway through the season.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears are set to travel to California to play San Diego State University Friday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The field hockey team continued its early season campaign this weekend with a trip to Virginia, where Bruno lost two games including an overtime decision against the College of William and Mary. The Bears (1-3) exchanged blows with The Tribe (3-2) throughout the contest, with two first period goals from forward Gina Openshaw ’20. But Bruno struggled to contain William and Mary’s offensive opportunities and allowed 15 shots on goal compared to just 7 on Brown’s side. Goalie Katie Hammaker ’19 proved a strong line of defense and made 11 saves. “Some specific areas of focus for the next couple games include making purposeful off-ball movement and against the grain cuts to create more scoring opportunities,” said forward Ellie Seid ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hammaker’s goalkeeping and bursts of offensive success allowed the Bears to remain competitive throughout the match. “Our passing patterns looked great, and we were able to win and execute corners,” Seid said. Trailing by a single goal with just 15 minutes left to play, Anya Nayak ’21 scored the equalizer off an assist from Rachel Lanouette ’19 to level the game at three goals apiece. The game extended into double overtime, when the Bears faltered and allowed six shots on goal. The Tribe finally scored the game winner in the 84th minute, securing a 4-3 victory. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The Bears looked to bounce back as they traveled to Richmond, Virginia on Sunday to face off against the University of Richmond. But Bruno was ultimately unsuccessful, falling 4-2 to the Spiders (2-4). The Bears once again struggled to control possession of the ball, allowing 17 shots from Richmond, seven of which were on goal. Brown added seven shots of their own on target, which included a goal from Seid in the first period off an assist from midfielder Danielle van Rootselaar ’22.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Van Rootselaar provided a stroke of hope with 15 minutes left in the match, when she scored a goal that narrowed the deficit to one and brought the team within striking distance of tying the game. But the Bears’ hopes were dashed when Richmond found the back of the net in the 69th minute, which cemented their victory and handed Bruno its second loss of the weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“One main goal for our team is being forward focused and focusing on staying in the present,” Nayak said. “Another goal is to stay connected on the field and continue to play as a unit.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Next weekend, the team will look to reverse the tides on its slow start. “Our goals for the season are to look forward and focus on the process. We strive to take risks and be known as a scoring team,” Seid said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m encouraged by the growth our team has had in the past month,” Nayak said. “We are a new team ready to attack whatever challenges we face.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will host the University of New Hampshire at home Friday before traveling to Hamden, Connecticut to face off against against Quinnipiac University Sunday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Rebecca Rosen ’22 is a rookie on the women’s soccer team, but she played like a true veteran against the College of the Holy Cross last weekend. Playing as a substitute, Rosen made her presence felt on the field, recording two shots and notching the game-winning goal in the 95th minute. Rosen located the ball in a sea of defenders off of a corner kick from midfielder Abby Carchio ’20 and headed it in for the golden goal. Rosen, who hails from Port Washington, New York, helped deliver the women’s soccer team its second win and first overtime victory of the season. For her outstanding performance against Holy Cross, Rosen has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Herald: Congratulations on scoring the game-winner! How did it feel to make such a big play as a first-year?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Rosen: It was a really exciting moment, especially for it to be my first goal, and in overtime. It was great to get that win and nice because we had been practicing those set plays earlier over and over in practice. So it was a repeat of that and made (the goal) much easier and much more likely to happen because of that practice and training.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>When did you first get involved with soccer?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I have been playing soccer probably since I was three years old. With one of my friends, I used to watch my older sister play. Then, the next year I started and have been playing ever since.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><b>When did you start to think that it would be realistic for you to play college soccer?</b></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My sister was getting recruited for lacrosse, and she was a year older than me. So in her sophomore year, she finally got recruited. Just seeing her going to play in college, I wanted to do the same thing. I’ve always loved soccer and that’s always been my sport, so I joined a club team at the start of my junior year and that was when I started training for colleges and that process. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Why did you choose to play at Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Obviously, part of it is just getting the looks for soccer and the offers. Compared to the other schools that I was looking at, it was the right size of campus and just open possibilities for what I want to study since I’m coming in here undecided. I think it’s just a great place to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Do you have any pre-game rituals?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I don’t usually have any, but one of the girls on the team has started braiding my hair. So I feel like that might start as one.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Although you haven’t been at Brown for a long time, what has been your favorite part of being on the team so far?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Probably my favorite part so far has been preseason, when it was just soccer. Women’s soccer was the first team on campus, and you would have summer practices, team lunch, team dinner and hangouts afterward. We would just get to know each other that way. We even got to go to California and stayed in some hotels with roommate and (that) was just a great bonding experience that I think has helped us on the field as well.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>What are your personal and team goals for the rest of the season?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Personal goals for the rest of the season are to just keep scoring and keep getting chances (and) maybe get my head on the ball one or two more times. I have not yet started a game either, so maybe to get one or two starts as well. Team goals are to work towards winning the Ivy League and get into the tournament in general.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Do you have any overarching aims for your career with the soccer team?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Not that I know of. I’m just taking it season by season and we’ll see how it goes from there.</p>
<p class="p3">The Bears will return to action in a matchup against Ocean State rival University of Rhode Island at Stevenson-Pincince Field Sunday at 1 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The beginning of the 2018 NFL season has been wacky. The Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns played to a tie. Aaron Rodgers came back from what looked like a season-ending injury and led the Green Bay Packers to victory over the Chicago Bears. Sam Darnold and the New York Jets obliterated the Detroit Lions and embarrassed newly hired head coach Matt Patricia. It’s a cliche in sports to say that anything can happen, but this truly seems to be an accurate description of the NFL landscape right now. With that in mind, let’s take a look at who could be playing down the road in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p class="p2">First off, the AFC. We have to begin with the New England Patriots. Though fans bemoaned the state of the organization in the offseason and worried about quarterback Tom Brady’s commitment to the team, the Patriots were their usual, triumphant selves in Week 1. They thoroughly outplayed the Houston Texans in a 27-20 win that wasn’t nearly as close as the final score indicated. The wide receiver corps may be a mess right now, and the team chemistry may not be perfect, but it’s difficult to see the combination of Brady, tight end Rob Gronkowski and coach Bill Belichick losing in the AFC playoffs. Thanks to the lackluster state of the AFC East, the Pats have the division title all but locked up. The path to the Super Bowl for any AFC team goes through New England.</p>
<p class="p2">The Kansas City Chiefs enjoyed a tremendous opening week performance, defeating the Los Angeles Chargers 38-28. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes received much of the attention, and for good reason, as he threw four touchdowns. His deep ball skills and strong arm helped Kansas City look more explosive and dangerous compared to the teams of previous years with Alex Smith at the helm. Mahomes and wide receiver Tyreek Hill beat the Chargers largely on their own thanks to Mahomes’ arm and Hill’s speed. Once running back Kareem Hunt and tight end Travis Kelce grow more involved, the Chiefs will be threatening in all phases of offense. But coach Andy Reid will have to manage the clock effectively in the playoffs — something that has proven difficult for the 60-year-old in years past.</p>
<p class="p2">Even though the Chargers lost to the Chiefs, I’m still high on this team. After starting out the 2017-18 season with four consecutive losses, Los Angeles raced to a 9-3 record down the stretch, just missing out on the playoffs. Between quarterback Philip Rivers, running back Melvin Gordon and wide receiver Keenan Allen, the Chargers have a balanced and dangerous offense. And their defense can get to the quarterback and make life difficult for opposing teams. No one will be able to hold off defensive ends Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram for long once Bosa returns from injury.</p>
<p class="p2">The Pittsburgh Steelers have been contenders in the AFC for a long time, but that run of success could be coming to an end. Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has shown signs of slippage in recent seasons. The situation surrounding Le’Veon Bell, who has refused to report to the team in hopes of a larger contract, has poisoned the locker room, with offensive linemen speaking out against the running back. The atmosphere in Pittsburgh is worsening fast.</p>
<p class="p2">Don’t forget about the Jacksonville Jaguars though. They were only a few plays away from beating New England in the AFC Championship Game last year. Their defense, led by the trash-talking cornerback Jalen Ramsey, is fearsome. So is running back Leonard Fournette. Quarterback Blake Bortles though? Not so much. I doubt whether the Jaguars can survive a Bortles playoff stinker like they did last year against the Buffalo Bills.</p>
<p class="p2">The NFC, meanwhile, is a jumbled heap, with no team truly separating from the pack. The Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl last season, but they must hope quarterback Carson Wentz returns soon because Nick Foles’ magic has run out. With wide receiver Alshon Jeffery injured as well, the Eagles will rely heavily on running back Jay Ajayi. It’s hard to see a way for Philly to score many points. The defense must win the games until Wentz returns. Fortunately, between Fletcher Cox, Chris Long, Michael Bennett, Malcolm Jenkins and others, the Eagles’ defense may be the best in the entire league. Philly could look entirely different in the playoffs with Wentz back, but at this moment, they are in survival mode. Expect plenty of low-scoring battles.</p>
<p class="p2">The Los Angeles Rams were a preseason favorite after a breakout 2017-18 season and a host of offseason moves. Quarterback Jared Goff just has to play within himself and create opportunities for running back Todd Gurley, the best in the NFL at his position. Wide receiver Brandin Cooks should help Goff, who improved mightily in his second campaign. Adding cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Marcus Peters, along with defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, made for a home run of an offseason. This team is scary.</p>
<p class="p2">The Minnesota Vikings upgraded their quarterback over the offseason, moving from Case Keenum to Kirk Cousins. While Keenum was great last season, Cousins has the more proven track record — we know Cousins will perform at a consistently high level. Wide receivers Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs are back, as is running back Dalvin Cook, but a worrying sense remains that the Vikings already missed their best shot at a championship. After a miraculous game-winning touchdown as time expired, Minnesota had only a win between themselves and a home Super Bowl game. If they couldn’t get the job done last year, why should this season be any different?</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I fully believed the New Orleans Saints would contend for a Super Bowl as well, but they need to prove that their shocking Week 1 loss to Tampa Bay was just a fluke. Giving up 48 points to Ryan Fitzpatrick cannot be a good sign. Quarterback Drew Brees, running back Alvin Kamara and wide receiver Michael Thomas did all they could, and the Saints did score 40 points. But will they be able to stop anyone? Marshon Lattimore, Cameron Jordan and the rest of the defense have to come ready to play in Week 2.</span></p>
<p class="p2">My Super Bowl pick: New England Patriots over Los Angeles Rams.</p>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: Use the right stats, not the common ones</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For the most part, baseball writers watched and described baseball the same way from about 1860 to 2001, give or take a few years either way. This isn’t entirely a bad thing: without all the stories of early baseball that these writers recorded, which may well otherwise have been forgotten, baseball wouldn’t have half the charm and tradition that it does today.</p>
<p class="p2">But the fact that writers went more than a century without adapting their coverage and analysis to developments in scouting and statistics has also left modern fans with a burden. Coverage of baseball has worked the same way for so long that fans are only now confronting the ultimate is/ought fallacy — what fans have been told for centuries isn’t actually how the game works.</p>
<p class="p2">There’s the walk, for example. Early baseball writers had a flawed understanding of strategy and statistics, which meant that for more than a hundred years, writers sorted players based on batting average. On-base percentage, which includes walks as well as hits, is the vastly more important statistic, but we’d been using batting average for so long that people thought it couldn’t just be wrong.</p>
<p class="p2">The same is true of the runs batted in, although as a statistic, RBI seems to be losing much of its undeserved clout in recent years. It’s easy to see what’s wrong with RBI: The best hitter in the world could play for a team of incompetents and might not drive in as many runs as a mediocre hitter on a team full of superstars who are consistently on base. But RBI caught on early because it makes intuitive sense. It’s hard to argue with getting a hit that drives in a run, even though it turns out that statistically speaking, RBIs are neither predictive nor comparative. Driving in runs now doesn’t mean a player is likely to drive in runs later, and it certainly doesn’t mean that a player is a good hitter.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the defensive side, there’s the error, another statistic which must have made sense at first, and as such went unchallenged for more than a century. But the problem with the error is that it’s completely subjective and far too limited in scope. To be assigned an error in the first place, a player has to be quick enough to get in position to field a ball. Meanwhile, a sub-par defender might not rack up errors for the simple reason that they weren’t in position to make difficult plays. If you sprint for a ball and it bounces out of your glove, that’s an error — if you jog and pick it up on two bounces, it’s a clean single.</span></p>
<p class="p2">And then, of course, there’s the eternal one-two punch of misleading pitching statistics, the win and the save. As far as saves go, I’m actually less skeptical. Pitching the ninth inning is no more valuable, statistically speaking, than pitching the seventh or the fourth; depending on the situation in any inning (which can be measured by a statistic called leverage index), any inning might be more important than the ninth. But there’s something about being able to pitch the ninth inning and nail down a win … there’s some value to being able to do that, even though the data may not show it. And that value is what the save measures, albeit imperfectly. So the save, until we find a better way to measure that intangible closer’s mentality, still has some value, although not as much as most people think.</p>
<p class="p2">But the win — well, that’s another story. The win has been losing its stature as a defining pitching statistic since 2010, when the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, in recognition of what it could tell was a stellar season, awarded Félix Hernández the Cy Young award despite a mediocre 13-12 record. And this year, the win looks ready to die completely. As evidence, I give you New York, where Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom is having one of the best pitching seasons in recent memory. DeGrom’s ERA is 1.71; his ERA+ is 216; on average, he is allowing less than a baserunner per inning and striking out 11 batters per nine.</p>
<p class="p2">But the Mets’ offense is a farce, a sick joke, so deGrom doesn’t look like a winning pitcher: his record is 8-9. In one of the greatest pitching seasons in a long time, deGrom, at least by win-loss record, looks like a sub-average pitcher.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It’s not hard to see how much the Mets’ paltry offense has hurt deGrom. In his eight wins this season, deGrom has pitched to a 0.97 ERA; in his other 21 outings, his ERA is 2.20. Put another way, take away deGrom’s eight winning starts, and his record would be 0-9 — and his 2.20 ERA would still be the best in the National League. The win is dead. The Mets’ offense killed it.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Why does all of this matter? Because awards season is coming up. And as baseball fans everywhere debate their picks for Most Valuable Player, Cy Young and Rookie of the Year, we should remember what’s actually important. It’s important not to form opinions based on numbers if we don’t know why the numbers are meaningful, or if we only think the numbers are important because they’re what we’re accustomed to using. Baseball is evolving, finally, and our understanding of the game is evolving too. So before making a point about a player, it’s essential to understand the numbers behind the point, and to know whether they actually mean anything.</p>

		<title>Nugent &#039;21: The AFC North is finally interesting</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These days, seeing that your team’s NFL schedule features Baltimore, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Pittsburgh doesn’t inspire the fear it used to. The AFC North is not the powerhouse division it was just a few seasons ago, and gone are the days of 2011 and 2014 when the division filled both wild card spots and half of the AFC playoff picture. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That said, this year’s AFC North is, finally, going to be fun to watch. There probably won’t be a wild card team coming out of it, which leaves three teams to fight for the division assuming that the Browns don’t have a chance. But for the first time in nearly five years, it looks like a fair fight.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem in the division in the last few years has been that the second and third place teams were good, but not good enough to crack the AFC playoffs. What makes this year interesting is not that the Ravens and Bengals have gotten substantially better — their improvement has been incremental at best. Rather, the Steelers are showing signs of vulnerability and the Browns finally, mercifully, didn’t lose. The regression towards the mean is real in this division.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last year, the Steelers’ march to the division crown saw only three regular season losses. Meanwhile, the Browns’ march to the first overall draft pick didn’t see a single win. In Week 1, those two teams played to a tie. Then both teams lost in Week 2. Finally, some parity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the middle of the division, the 9-7 Ravens missed the playoffs in a weak AFC field last year only because of a loss in the final minute of the season to the 7-9 Bengals. In Thursday’s 34-23 Bengals’ win, those two teams showed that they’re both still ready for a fight.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Granted, two weeks is a small sample size, and we could still see Pittsburgh resume dominance and the Browns fail to win. Going only off the Ravens 47-3 drubbing of the Bills, you wouldn’t have expected them to lose in Cincinnati four days later. But regardless of sample size, this is a competitive division.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pittsburgh is probably still the team expected to not only outplay their early performance but to waltz to a division title. However, the longer Le’Veon Bell sits out, the more easily wins will come for Steelers’ opposition. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">James Conner is not going to put up 135 rushing yards for the Steelers every week. NFL defenses are just too smart for that. Compounding the problem, Ben Roethlisberger’s age — 36 — is finally starting to show,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as three interceptions against the Browns suggest. Pittsburgh’s reign at the top of the North may finally be coming to an end. And don’t count on the Browns to continue the ineptitude they’ve shown the last two years. A scrappy fourth quarter comeback against Pittsburgh showed they aren’t going as quietly this year. If Baker Mayfield can translate his college success and take over for stopgap Tyrod Taylor, the division might be moving toward four competitive teams for the first time in a long time. But whether the Browns find real success or not, this division is finally intriguing again.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So this year, if you get tired of watching the Patriots beat up on the three mediocre teams they share the East with, keep an eye on the North for entertaining football. It’s anyone’s division at this point, and it may stay that way for a long time.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The women’s soccer team has not lost to the University of Rhode Island since 2007, and it continued its winning streak Sunday afternoon in a 5-0 shutout victory over the in-state rival. The win was the Bears’ most lopsided victory against URI since 1994 and marked their second win in a week. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a great performance (and) good result,” said Head Coach Kia McNeill. “The past few games, we’ve been able create a lot of opportunities, but we weren’t necessarily converting on the back end. It was nice that we were able to put the final pieces together today and put a few in the back of the net.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears (3-4-1) started the contest as the more aggressive team, earning a header, corner kick and free kick in the first five minutes. As the half continued and both squads settled in, Bruno continued to dominate possession of the ball. In the twelfth minute, Bridget Stokdyk ’22 launched a point-blank shot mere feet from the goal, but the Rams (1-8-1) were able to make an impressive save to keep the contest knotted at zero. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown continued to control possession and methodically push the ball down the field, while limiting the Rams’ threats to quick counter-attacks. The Bears had recorded four shots on goal before the Rams could notch one in the eighteenth minute. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even though the Bears had a firm grasp on the pace of play throughout the first half, they could not convert any of their golden opportunities. But in the thirty-third minute, Bruno earned a corner kick, and Maesyn G’Bye ’22 launched the ball directly into the box to set up Sydney Cummings ’21 for a header. Cummings soared above the defense and was able to knock the ball through the pipes for the opening score. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s really important to put the first one away early and just build that momentum,” Cummings said. “We’ve been struggling to score, so I was happy that I could start the run of five goals.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just seven minutes later, G’Bye pushed toward the net and flicked the ball high up into the air. Charlotte Devaughn ’22 was able to locate the high pass and head the ball over the reach of the Rams’ netminder and into the left corner of the net to put the Bears up 2-0. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno’s dominance in the first half was evident in its stats: At halftime, the Bears led in shots 11-1 and corner kicks 5-0.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the second period, the Bears picked up right where they left off, earning several opportunities off of aggressive plays in the opening moments of the half. In the forty-seventh minute, Star White ’21 controlled the ball in the center of the field and edged away from her marker. White rocketed a spectacular shot from the top of the goal box that curved over the defense and through the top left corner of the net. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just four minutes later, Abby Carchio ’20 added to the scoring with a goal of her own to extend the Bears’ lead to four. Zoe Maxwell ’22 pushed the ball into the Rams’ zone in the fifty-eighth minute and was able to earn an opportunity and score on a powerful shot to put the Bears ahead 5-0, the final score of the match. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We had a lot of different goal-scorers today, which I think shows some of the threats that we have in the attacking third,” McNeill said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So it’s definitely a good confidence builder to start heading into the Ivy play in the next two games.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the final whistle sounded, the Bears led the Rams in shots 19-4 and corner kicks 9-3. The team seeks to ride this powerful momentum into the start of Ivy League play against Dartmouth this Saturday. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This was a really important win to build our confidence,” Cummings said. “Saturday is the real test. Dartmouth is always a hard competitor, so it this game is really important to keep the momentum going.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will return to Stevenson-Pincince Field to play the University of Massachusetts Lowell Tuesday at 7 p.m. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: Shohei Ohtani for Rookie of the Year</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Back in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/11/schapiro-19-next-babe-ruth-tempe-arizona/">March</a>, I called Shohei Ohtani “the most exciting baseball story of the year, or even the decade.” In the early days of baseball season, Ohtani certainly lived up to my characterization: He was hitting home runs like a slugger, and at one point, he took a perfect game into the seventh inning of a start against the Athletics. But then Ohtani felt something in his arm, and fulfilling critics’ prophesies that he would injure himself, tests showed that he had a torn Ulnar Collateral Ligament and needed Tommy John surgery. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But wait — he didn’t! No, Ohtani just played on because of what makes him the most exciting player anyone’s seen in a long time: He’s not just a pitcher. He has also become the Angels’ primary designated hitter. And while he’s waiting until the end of the season to make a decision on Tommy John surgery, it seems only fair to reward him with a Rookie of the Year award for what has been by far the best — and most intriguing — season among American League rookies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Just look at the numbers. At the plate so far, Ohtani has put together a .293/.371/.593 slash line, good for an .964 OPS (on-base plus slugging), along with 20 home runs and nine steals. At least in terms of raw statistics, that puts him far above the two other contenders for the award, the Yankees’ Gleyber Torres and Miguel Andújar. Andújar is batting .299/.333/.522; his .855 OPS is more than 100 points below Ohtani’s. Torres, meanwhile, is batting .280/.349/.497, for an OPS of .846. I am a well-known Yankee hater, so I want to make it clear that both these players have had extremely impressive rookie seasons: Both, it seems, will contribute to the Yankees continuing to make the playoffs every season for years to come.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But we’re looking at very clear contrasts among offensive seasons: .964, .855 and .846 OPS marks. Although he doesn’t have enough plate appearances to qualify for the season-long leaderboards, Ohtani’s OPS would place fifth in the American League. Torres and Andújar do not even crack the top 10. And for good measure, Andújar has two stolen bases and Torres has five; Ohtani has nine.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Those against naming Ohtani MVP point to the relatively few appearances he’s made, compared to his two competitors for the award. Ohtani has played 91 games as a batter; Torres has played 110, and Andújar 136. But Ohtani hasn’t missed games for bad reasons: For months of the season, before his arm injury took him off the mound, Ohtani missed two to three games a week when the Angels held him out of the lineup before and after starts in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to keep his arm fresh.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But while he was on the mound, Ohtani was just as impressive as he was at the plate: In ten starts, Ohtani went 4-2 with a 3.31 Earned Run Average. In 51.2 innings pitched, he struck out 63 batters, which comes out to 11 strikeouts per nine. Ohtani’s potential on the mound was evident to anyone who saw him pitch: His breaking pitches were close to unhittable, and at times, his fastball approached 100 miles per hour. Obviously, whether he opts to undergo Tommy John surgery or not, Ohtani will not pitch for at least a year, but that doesn’t mean the starts he made this year didn’t count: This season, Ohtani was both a pitcher and a hitter, and he did both impressively. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Torres and Andújar both had good — almost great — seasons. But Ohtani was better. He was a better hitter than either competitor, and as if that wasn’t enough, he was also an elite starting pitcher. His arm troubles mean that he’s unlikely to repeat at least the pitching portion of his performance in the near future, but this year, it already happened. Shohei Ohtani may not have had the best rookie numbers of all time, but I don’t think I remember any other rookie season measuring up to his in terms of raw impressiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For me, that’s the deciding factor. The two Yankees rookies vying for the award both had good seasons. But neither was a ridiculous, mind-blowing phenomenon whose very existence was thought to be almost impossible. Shohei Ohtani did something that, for decades, was something you just couldn’t do. For him to end the season without so much as an award for doing what no one has done since the early days of the 20th century? Unthinkable. Shohei Ohtani needs to be the American League Rookie of the Year.</span></p>

		<title>Bruno kicks off Touchdowns for Cancer</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/20/bruno-kicks-off-touchdowns-cancer/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Long before the 2018 season officially kicked off, Alex Hughes ’20 approached Head Coach Phil Estes with an idea for a fundraising event that would give the Bears an opportunity to contribute to the fight against cancer each time they took the field. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Touchdowns for Cancer will turn every Bruno touchdown into a donation toward cancer treatment and research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Donors can give a one-time contribution at any point or pledge a certain amount per touchdown and donate the sum at the end of the season.</p>
<p class="p4">The initiative builds on the work of the football team’s annual Bench Press for Cancer event, a one-day <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/19/bears-host-breast-cancer-awareness-events/">fundraiser</a> for Miriam Hospital’s Cancer Survivorship Program for Young Adults held each October since 2004, and it mimics a shorter campaign Hughes orchestrated as a senior in high school for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Over the course of four games during his high school career, Hughes and his teammates raised “a few thousand dollars.” As Touchdowns for Cancer spans Bruno’s entire schedule, he anticipates the fundraiser will be a larger-scale philanthropic effort with a goal of $15,000 to $20,000.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I saw huge potential for money being raised for an organization,” Hughes said. “I saw the potential of everything that we can do with the football team, the football community and Brown at large.”</span></p>
<p class="p4">“This is something a lot of the guys on the team want to get behind because it’s directly affected our Brown football family,” added<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Co-Captain Michael Hoecht ’20.</p>
<p class="p4">Hughes is no stranger to the Brown football community; his family has Bruno ties that date back to the 1950s. His grandfather, an alum from the class of 1955, was heavily involved in the Brown Sports Foundation and Brown Football Association, while Peter Hughes ’10 and Robert Hughes ’17 preceded their younger brother on the Bears’ defense.</p>
<p class="p4">Hughes also has a personal connection with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where his uncle, Bill Perry ’88, received cancer treatment before passing away in December 2017. “He was a real Brown Bear,” Hughes said. “He pushed through everything.”</p>
<p class="p4">In his time on College Hill, Perry was a standout defensive lineman for the Bears and earned All-Ivy and All-American honors. He received the Alfred H. Joslin Award, was <a href="https://brownbears.com/hof.aspx?hof=237">inducted</a> into the Brown Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997 and was <a href="https://brownbears.com/sports/2018/5/8/browns-125th-anniversary-team-football.aspx?id=2665">chosen</a> for the 125th Anniversary Team in 2003 as one of the 50 greatest Brown football players.</p>
<p class="p4">“Billy Perry was a special person,” Estes said. “(He) was a big fixture here in Brown football, not just as a player but also as an alum.”</p>
<p class="p4">With high-profile rivalry games against Harvard and the University of Rhode Island approaching, Hughes hopes to advertise how much each touchdown is worth as a way to keep fans intrigued and boost on-field motivation among his teammates.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s … inspirational for the team and for a lot of people in the community,” he said. “It’ll bring a lot of people closer to the program and definitely give a lot of money to a good cause.”</p>
<p class="p4">So when Brown football players cross the plane into the end zone this season, they’ll be earning more than six points. The Bears hope to gain the support of members of the Brown community to help the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute make strides in battling cancer.</p>
<p class="p4"><i>If supporters would like to make a single donation, they can do so through the team’s <a href="https://www.kintera.org/c.dtIOKYNKLkJ4E/b.8726851/k.7FE8/Find_a_Page/siteapps/personalpage/ShowPage.aspx?c=dtIOKYNKLkJ4E&amp;b=8726851&amp;sid=jkKWK5NMLgLYLdOQJtF">Giving Page</a>. </i></p>
<p class="p4"><i>Those who would like to make a season-long pledge or have any questions about the event should email brownbearstd4c@gmail.com. The team will keep track of the total touchdowns scored in 2018 and inform the pledgers of the amount at the end of the season. </i></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Football to open home slate against Crimson</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Tonight, as the football team hosts Harvard under the lights for its home opener at Brown Stadium, the Bears strive to both look to the future and commemorate the past. Bruno has not won an Ivy League game in 677 long days, but Head Coach Phil Estes is optimistic about the upcoming season, which features nine more contests after the team played California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California, last weekend.</p>
<p class="p4">Estes, whose football teams won Ivy League Championships in 1999, 2005 and 2008, put much of the blame for Bruno’s losses on himself, saying that he “did a really poor job of coaching and motivating this team last year.” Through the long off-season, Estes says that he “had to make improvements with himself first, and then with the team.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears dropped the first game of their 140th season to Cal Poly last weekend, but Estes had many positive takeaways from the loss. “There are some really good things that we saw,” he said. “Michael McGovern ’21 threw the ball very well, and we made a lot of good plays out there. But we didn’t finish in the red zone, so that’s something that we’re going to work on for this game.”</p>
<p class="p4">Estes stressed that his squad needs to finish off scoring chances but showed confidence in his kicker if the game comes down to field goals. “Dylan Brady ’22 was three-for-three kicking field goals,” he said. “So we know that we have a weapon there.”</p>
<p class="p4">The game against the Crimson will be broadcast on national television. This will not be Bruno’s first time in the media spotlight — the Bears battled Dartmouth under the shadow of the Green Monster at Fenway Park last season. Entering tonight’s contest, Estes believes that the prospect of facing Harvard will motivate the team to play hard.</p>
<p class="p4">“It doesn’t matter if you’re playing under the lights or playing in the backyard,” he said. “It’s just a game that you’re going to get up for. … This is the time for the team to step up.”</p>
<p class="p4">Tonight’s game will also feature a half-time ceremony for Professor Emeritus of Engineering Barrett Hazeltine, who has been a member of Brown’s faculty since 1959. The ceremony will include a commemorative video on the Jumbotron and an announcement that the football locker room will be named in his honor.</p>
<p class="p4">Hazeltine “has taught and mentored generations of students,” said Athletic Director Jack Hayes. “His impact on Brown is immeasurable.”</p>
<p class="p4">Hayes went on to say that Hazeltine has been a partner in providing “an outstanding academic and athletic experience to students” and that “his longevity at Brown is a symbol of academic excellence, stability and a willingness to work with and teach so many students over so many years.”</p>
<p class="p4">Hazeltine said that he was “overwhelmed” when he learned that he would be recognized. “It’s a tremendous honor,” he said. “Surprised is not strong enough of a word for how I feel about it. I think it’s a very kind and thoughtful gesture.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Over his long teaching career, Hazeltine has held athletes at Brown in high regard. “People who play sports at Brown tend to be remarkably decent and thoughtful and effective students,” Hazeltine said. “Something has happened on this campus that has made our athletes really good, solid citizens and good people in the classroom and people that we can look up to.”</span></p>
<p class="p4">The Bears and the Crimson will kick off tonight at Brown Stadium at 7 p.m., and Brown and Rhode Island School of Design students will receive free admission to the stadium. The game will be broadcast on ESPN-Universities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Andrew Penner ’22 is a first-year on the men’s water polo team, and he just wrapped up Brown’s last stretch before conference play with six goals in three games. Scoring four against Connecticut College before adding one apiece in two games at Austin College, Penner, a graduate of Massachusetts’ Deerfield Academy, has had no trouble finding the net recently. Penner’s performances helped carry the Bears into conference play on a four-game winning streak and made him The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p5"><b>Herald: How did it feel to score four in one game against Connecticut College the other day?</b></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Penner: It felt really good. Our coach took that game as a good opportunity to get some of the younger guys playing time and see how they handled it in a competitive game. It was really good to get in there and get some experience.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><b>You scored again when you guys went to Texas — do you feel like you’re hitting your stride?</b></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Yeah. Texas has a really young program and water polo is just developing there, so it was another chance for a lot of our freshmen to get some playing time. I felt good in the water, and I feel like I’m learning a lot. We have our offensive and defensive systems, and I have a lot to learn with those, have to get a little bit bigger and stronger. Then it’s just getting in a rhythm with the guys and learning how they play and how I fit into the team, (which) is really important.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>What’s it like to be able to contribute right away like that as a freshman?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Our coach trusts our freshmen a lot. We’re all getting in and playing a lot. Some of the other guys have been getting in and putting up as many (as I), or even more goals as well. So, I think we’re all getting that good experience, which is really nice.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Did you ever feel like the Connecticut College game was in doubt after going up 7-0 after a quarter and 11-2 at halftime?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">We had a couple tough games last weekend at the Princeton Invitational, and then also at our tournament, the Bruno Classic. So I think we took that (Connecticut) College game as an opportunity to practice, no matter who the opponent is. … To play the best regardless of who we’re in the pool against, whether it’s the number one team — UCLA ­— or anyone else.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Both goalies managed nine saves — do you feel confident having them behind you?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Absolutely. Both of our goalies, I think, are the two best goalies on the East Coast for sure. They’re definitely better than a lot of the goalies on the West Coast as well. Ugo (Piovan ’22) is a freshman … Riad (Hallal ’21) is a sophomore, but they’re both really experienced and really committed guys. Yeah, we definitely trust them in the cage.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>You guys were the visiting team for the first men’s water polo game in Texas in four decades, how was that?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">It was nice. Texas obviously isn’t a big water polo state, so it was really interesting to go there. We ended up going to Austin College for our first game, and it was just cool to see. I forget exactly how many fans they had there, but it was one of most packed crowds I’ve ever seen for water polo. The stands were totally full, the atmosphere was amazing. Obviously they were supporting the other team, but it was just cool to play in that atmosphere where it was just so loud and so passionate. And I think a lot of people in Texas haven’t seen a water polo game in a long time, so I think they were really interested in it.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>The Bears played an exhibition in Dallas against a team with a couple of former Brown water polo players. What was that like?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">One of the alumni was Rico (Burke ’18) who graduated last year, and the other, Warren (Smith ’17)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>graduated — I think — two years ago. So it was cool to play against them. Obviously as a freshman I don’t know those two that well, but all the older guys on the team now hung out and talked with them before the game and afterwards. It was nice to play against some older guys.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>How are you guys feeling about the rest of the season as the No. 18 team in the country?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">We’re feeling good. I think we have a lot of ground to cover in terms of developing as a team. The skill is definitely there, and we know what we can do, it’s just putting it into practice in the next couple of weeks going into conference games. Then eventually, by the conference championship in November, hopefully we’ll be where we want to be.</span></p>

		<title>Men’s soccer stuns Harvard in OT</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The men’s soccer team earned its first Ivy League win of the season after netting a dramatic overtime goal against Harvard Saturday night at Stevenson-Pincince Field. Despite dominating possession for most of the game, the Bears could not convert on their numerous scoring opportunities in regulation. But a well-timed pass from midfielder Daniel Schiller ’20 allowed Toby Howell ’19 to tap in the game-winning goal from close range and seal the 1-0 victory for Bruno in the 103rd minute.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After struggling in its first two Ivy League contests with a 3-1 loss to Columbia and a 2-0 loss to Princeton, Brown (6-5, 1-2 Ivy) found itself at the bottom of the league standings. Still, Head Coach Patrick Laughlin said that the Bears enter every game with a determined mindset. “Every Ivy League game, we feel, is a must-win,” Laughlin said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown appeared to have the advantage over Harvard (3-9, 1-2) throughout the majority of the first half. By halftime, Bruno led Harvard in shots on goal and corner kicks by identical 3-1 margins. The first promising opportunity for the Bears arose when forward Malcolm Johnson ’22 helped set up a Brown corner in the seventh minute. Schiller took the kick, but midfielder Derek Waleffe ’22 headed it over the net. Just two minutes later, Bruno missed another chance as defender Will Crain ’22 lobbed a pass to defender Jackson Goebel ’20, whose header was on the mark but was brilliantly saved by Harvard goalkeeper Matt Freese. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Harvard stumbled soon after Freese’s save as Crimson forward Alfred Perez committed a bad foul and earned himself a yellow card in the 14th minute. But Perez rebounded, creating what was arguably Harvard’s best chance for a score in the game. Alone near Brown’s goal, Perez attempted to lob the ball over goalkeeper James Swomley ’22. Swomley leaped up and just barely blocked the ball with his fingertips, an impressive athletic display that prevented Harvard from taking the lead. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno had two more solid chances to score before halftime, including a transition shot by midfielder Matthew Chow ’20 that was off the mark and a shot by forward Nathan Plano ’21 that Freese saved. Laughlin was not worried about the Bears’ several missed opportunities. “Goal scoring is hard — if it was easy, everyone would do it. The more opportunities you create, the greater chance you get one to go in, like we did at the end,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Crimson went on a small run in the beginning of the second half, controlling possession for the majority of the first 20 minutes. Brown managed to regroup and reclaim control for the remainder of the Ivy League showdown. “There’s always up and downs in every game,” said defender Gabe Welp ’19. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As Brown began to get into its groove, midfielder Nicolas Perez ’22 set up an opportunity for the Bears to get on the board. Howell drove down the field and sent a pass to Perez in transition, but the midfielder missed the short-range shot just to the left. Harvard’s Taner Dogan had the second of the Crimson’s two shots on goal in the game in the 81st minute, but another leaping one-handed save by Swomley kept the score level. Brown was in control for the rest of regulation, sending a barrage of shots Harvard’s way as time wound down, though all of its attempts were unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With the game still tied at zero, the Bears and the Crimson entered two ten-minute sudden-death overtime periods. Early in the first overtime, defender Will Mims ’21 was knocked down inside the Harvard penalty box but no foul was called, drawing the ire of the Brown crowd. But fans of the Bears were soon sent into a frenzy as Howell kicked in the game-winner for the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I wanted the initial ball to be played to me, but it was played to Schiller. But I found myself in front of the goal with a good pass from Schiller and I tapped it in,” Howell described. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno will continue its four-game homestand against Providence College Tuesday. The Friars also defeated Harvard 2-1 earlier this year.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">We’ve seen some surprising results so far in the NFL season. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were widely expected to finish last in the NFC South as one of the worst teams in the entire league, yet they knocked off the New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles in back-to-back weeks for a 2-0 start. The Kansas City Chiefs can seemingly score whenever they want to with Patrick Mahomes at the helm. On the other side of the coin, however, the Pittsburgh Steelers limped to a 0-1-1 record with lots of team chemistry issues. But which of these early season trends will continue?</p>
<p class="p3">The Buccaneers can’t keep their current pace for long. Ryan Fitzpatrick threw for 400-plus yards in his first two outings, along with eight touchdowns. Everyone loves to talk about the “Fitzmagic” phenomenon — when Fitzpatrick gets absurdly hot and cannot be stopped. The problem with Fitzpatrick is that Fitzmagic eventually ends, and when Fitzmagic ends, things get ugly. Fitzpatrick is interception-prone, with a 19:20 touchdown to interception ratio over the 2016 and 2017 seasons combined. Those turnovers are coming Tampa Bay’s way soon. Quarterback Jameis Winston will return from his suspension after Week 3 but has shown nothing in his career that indicates he will help this team. Wide receiver DeSean Jackson has 275 receiving yards and three touchdowns in two games thanks to Fitzpatrick. But he’s 31 and hasn’t been a force in the league since 2014. The Bucs feel like a 7-9 or 8-8 team to me, though to give them credit, that’s far more than most anyone expected entering the season.</p>
<p class="p3">The Kansas City Chiefs raced past the Los Angeles Chargers and Pittsburgh Steelers in the first two weeks, scoring a blistering 80 points total. Mahomes threw for 10 touchdowns and no interceptions, and while that ratio won’t continue, he looks legit. Mahomes can launch the football deep with more ease than almost anyone else in the league, and he looks poised beyond his years. Still, it’s hard to trust a rookie quarterback for an entire season, and the Chiefs have a history of cooling off after hot starts under Coach Andy Reid. In Week 1 last season, they dominated then defending champion New England, scoring 42 points behind Alex Smith and Kareem Hunt. Those 2017 Chiefs went 5-0 before stumbling and making an early exit from the playoffs. In 2016, Kansas City went 9-3 to open the year but still lost their first playoff game, this one in the divisional round.</p>
<p class="p3">I’m taking a wait-and-see approach with the Chiefs. They look absolutely loaded, but they’ve looked dominant in other seasons that ended in disappointing and underwhelming fashions. Until Kansas City wins a game in the divisional round of the playoffs, I can only consider them a 10-6, wild card kind of team. They have much to prove to the football world in January 2019.</p>
<p class="p3">The Pittsburgh Steelers, meanwhile, played far worse than anticipated. Star running back Le’Veon Bell’s continued holdout doesn’t help matters, of course. It seems more and more likely that Bell will wait until Week 8 or Week 9 to return to the team — when he can still retain his free agent status next off-season but not risk the Steelers running him into the ground throughout an entire year. Bell is basically punting on 2018 in the hopes of a healthy and wealthy 2019. Wide receiver Antonio Brown’s discontent grows stronger by the week. He responded with anger to a former employee of the Pittsburgh Steelers on Twitter the day after Pittsburgh’s Week 2 loss, sarcastically (maybe) tweeting<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“trade me.” Brown missed Monday’s practice for unexplained reasons, to add to the situation. As much as Coach Mike Tomlin tries to downplay the Brown issue, the wide receiver has made it clear that something negative is happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="p3">Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was rocky to start off as well, throwing three interceptions in Week 1 against the Browns. Big Ben rebounded in Week 2, but the 36-year-old has grown more and more inconsistent in recent seasons, and 2018 looks no different. It could be his bumpiest campaign yet. Considering his advanced age, it would be no great surprise if Roethlisberger declined precipitously this year.</p>
<p class="p3">It’s looking like the end of an era for the Steelers. Offensive linemen spoke out against Le’Veon Bell before the season, Antonio Brown continues to express displeasure and Roethlisberger made a number of curious comments in the offseason. On Pittsburgh’s drafting of Mason Rudolph, the veteran said, “I was surprised when they took a quarterback because I thought that maybe in the third round, you know you can get some really good football players that can help this team now … But that’s not my decision to make. That’s on the coaches and the GM and the owner and those kind of things.” These are not the words of a happy quarterback. Roethlisberger later said these comments were taken out of context and that he meant them “in jest.” Nevertheless, whether you believe the quarterback or not, the Steelers’ locker room is a toxic environment.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Luckily for Pittsburgh, the AFC North is not exactly a powerhouse division. Between the Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns, the Steelers only need to be above-average to make the playoffs. But do they have that kind of season left in the tank? I remain unconvinced.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Moral victories are not often desired in sports, but as the football team walked off of the field following a 31-17 loss to Harvard Friday night, the Bears could hold their heads high. After coming out of the locker room flat under the lights, Brown (0-2, 0-1 Ivy) faced a 24-3 halftime deficit. But Bruno was defiant and fought back to be within one score of the Crimson deep into the fourth quarter before Harvard (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) pulled away for the final time.</p>
<p class="p4">“What I saw was a team that fought, had life, never gave up and was just a few plays away from being a good football team,” said Head Coach Phil Estes P’18. “We need to be complete and make a few more plays.”</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno’s offense came out firing on their first drive of the game, and quarterback Michael McGovern ’21 made a few impressive plays with his feet to get out of the pocket and gain first downs. The offense stalled deep in Crimson territory, but the Bears kicked a field goal to put the first points on the board. McGovern was five-for-nine with 55 yards on the drive.</p>
<p class="p4">But the rest of the half belonged to the Crimson. Harvard exploited the Bears’ missed tackles to get into Brown territory, and Crimson quarterback Jake Smith threw a 22-yard touchdown pass down the seam to Henry Taylor for six. On Harvard’s next drive, running back BJ Watson broke away for a lightning-quick 43-yard touchdown run to gain an early 14-3 advantage.</p>
<p class="p4">Later in the half, McGovern made a bad read and threw a pick to Harvard defensive back Cole Thompson, who took off toward the end zone to give the Crimson a seemingly insurmountable lead.</p>
<p class="p4">Yet the Bears had their chances and showed life, too. Estes demonstrated some of his gutsy play-calling, and McGovern flashed his arm strength on a deep flea-flicker pass to Jakob Prall ’20 for a 53-yard gain. Prall would finish the game with 120 receiving yards. Bruno also halted a promising Crimson drive with an interception in the red zone by Jorquel Condomina ’19. But stalled drives, interceptions and failed fourth down conversions put an end to many of Brown’s scoring opportunities.</p>
<p class="p4">Down 24-3 at halftime, the Bears came out of the locker room looking like a reinvigorated squad. Special teams put Brown back in the game and shifted the momentum, as Harvard missed a field goal on their first drive of the half, and a bad snap on a Crimson punt put the Bears’ offense on the Harvard 13-yard line.</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno took advantage of Harvard’s punting gaffe, and McGovern rocketed a play-action pass to Jaelon Blandburg ’20 for a four-yard touchdown to cut the Crimson’s lead to 24-10 with seven minutes to go in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="p4">“Energy changes the game,” Blandburg said. “We get (an) interception and everyone is going crazy, and the offense comes back. Now we’re ready to roll.”</p>
<p class="p4">From that point onward, the Bears’ defense took control of the game as the once-potent Harvard offense shifted into neutral. With 13:35 left in the fourth quarter, Sebastian Dovi ’19 out-muscled a Crimson receiver for a critical interception to stop Harvard deep in Bruno’s territory.</p>
<p class="p4">“We can run with everybody, we can run with every team in the Ivy League and tackle with every team in the Ivy League,” said defensive lineman Michael Hoecht ’20. “We’re going to win. This team is going to win a lot of football games.”</p>
<p class="p4">McGovern then led the offense down the field, and with the help of a 55-yard gain by Prall, put the Bears on the outskirts of the red zone. On third down, and with the pocket collapsing around him, McGovern managed to fire a strike to tight end Anton Casey ’19.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Casey caught the pass and broke free from the linebacker to gallop into the endzone for a crucial touchdown to put the Bears within one score of the Crimson with only 12 minutes left in the game.</p>
<p class="p4">But on the Crimson’s next series, it was clear that the tough and physical nature of the game had caught up with Brown’s defense. Harvard faced four third downs on the drive, and all four times the Crimson converted. Harvard’s last conversion was a touchdown pass to Adam Scott that put the game out of reach for Bruno.</p>
<p class="p4">“This is the difference from last year,” Estes said. “After this, we’d be down, and nobody would have their heads up, and they wouldn’t see what we can become. … It’s different now, they understand that we (have) things to fix, but we can fix this and be better.”</p>
<p class="p4">McGovern finished the game 22-43 from the field for 293 yards, two touchdowns and two picks. The Bears were six-for-16 on third downs and gained 325 total yards.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’re going to learn how to win, we’re going to learn how to fight and we’re going to learn how to finish,” Estes said. “When we do that, watch out.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears will return to the field Saturday at 1 p.m. for a home contest against Georgetown University.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that the Cleveland Browns have snapped a losing streak that spanned over a full season and nearly two full calendar years, the time to crown the new most dysfunctional NFL franchise is here. There are many candidates vying for the throne. It would seem hard to outdo the Buffalo Bills, whose prospects for this season are so dim that veteran defensive back Vontae Davis retired during halftime of the team’s second game of the season. There are also the Oakland Raiders, who are a lame duck franchise in their own city and who traded away Khalil Mack, possibly the best defensive player in the game, only to have new head coach Jon Gruden lament that “great pass rushers are hard to find.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though those two teams will be lucky to win a combined eight games this season, they will have to settle for silver and bronze when it comes to dysfunction in the NFL. Fittingly, the gold goes to the Pittsburgh Steelers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the heart of the problem for the Steelers, who began the season by tying those Cleveland Browns and losing to Kansas City the following week, is a holdout by star running back Le’Veon Bell. Wanting a lucrative long-term contract, Bell refused to accept a $14.5 million franchise tag for one more season with the Steelers. Not only have the Steelers missed Bell’s production on the field, but the prolonged episode appears ready to tear the team’s locker room apart.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are those who are so pro-player when it comes to contract disputes that they will never draw a line where smart business crosses into petulance. This is becoming the default position among sports media figures, who have been finding new ways of equivocating in favor of Bell quitting on his team since the episode began. Take to Twitter and search Bell’s name, and you will see a sharp divide between this media stance and fans’ opinions. This is a contrast that is central to other issues in the sport such as the National Anthem protests, concussions and player safety.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have no doubt that political leanings have an impact on these two poles of opinion. But there also exists a fundamental split in how sports are seen by different pockets of society that could explain the Bell controversy and others just as easily as left versus right politics can.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fans critical of Bell believe that teams are the beating heart of sports. Part of that belief comes from the idea that fans see themselves as an integral arm of a successful sports franchise. The angry online fan tweeting to a player that “I pay your salary” has become a cliché at this point, but it is flatly ignorant to minimize the investment of time and money that fans put into their support. Tickets to tonight’s Steelers’ game against Tampa Bay start at $110 and go up from there. Meanwhile, Bell is not exactly struggling — he’s willing to give up nearly $1 million for each Sunday he stays at home. No Steelers fan thinks they are as valuable to the franchise’s success as Le’Veon Bell, but good luck getting die-hard fans in a blue-collar city to sympathize with a player who thinks $14.5 million isn’t enough.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the other hand, sports media tend to see individuals as the heart of sports, whether they are coaches or players. Part of this tendency is built into their job description as journalists — star athletes generate the most attention and garner the most clicks. It is also self-serving, to an extent. Many reporters will do whatever it takes to remain in the good graces of star players, including directing harsh criticisms at their fellow reporters who make a consistent effort to ask pointed questions instead of lobbing softballs. They care much less about how blind defense of players like Bell will alienate fans, even though those fans also pay for newspaper subscriptions as well as football tickets.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bell will mostly likely sit out the entire 2018 season, and the rift developing in the Steelers’ locker room could very well keep them out of the playoffs, despite having no shortage of talent even without him on the field. Such a result would rightly damage Bell’s reputation and turn other teams off from signing him in the offseason. If things get really ugly, Bell could walk away from the sport entirely, a move he has threatened publicly before. Even in this extreme case, because of the different ways team sports are understood, don’t be surprised to hear a chorus of media types claiming that it really was worth it the whole time.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">An eerie silence hung over the eighth hole of the Kirkbrae Country Club golf course. There wasn’t much to talk about as Chuck Isgar ’20.5 studied the contours and tilts of the green before lining up a 30-foot putt, but his partner, Drew Powell ’21, did offer up one piece of advice: “Go do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So in front of a small audience consisting of three golfers and a couple of officials, Isgar attempted a shot for birdie that would send the two to the U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thirty-three and a half hours earlier, Powell and Isgar teed off at the qualifying tournament with a goal of punching their tickets to the United States Golf Association event. The Four-Ball Championship has a unique format in which two golfers team up, play the entire course simultaneously and count the lowest score on each hole. Each team is only allowed one opportunity to qualify, and if they do not succeed in that attempt, they must wait until the next year to try again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the qualifier hosted in Lincoln, Rhode Island,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>only the top two pairs earned berths to the national championship, out of 40 teams vying for the coveted spots.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though they didn’t enter the tournament with a set strategy, the duo knew they could rely on their complementary playing styles to piece together a solid score. Powell has an edge in driving the ball while Isgar comes up clutch in must-make putts. When one made par, the other could be a bit more aggressive and go for trickier shots.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That collaboration proved successful through 15 holes. The Bears had momentum and a five-under-par score of 66 after Powell started the day with a birdie on the second hole and shaved off another stroke by sinking a 40-foot putt on the sixth. But dark clouds and sirens halted Powell and Isgar’s play with only three holes left, and the pair was carted off the course to watch the rain. They wouldn’t have a shot at completing the course until the following afternoon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
Perhaps it was Isgar’s decision to re-wear the (now lucky) neon green golf shirt he had sported the day before that kept them in contention on the second day as the team had a slow start. A par on 16 left both a touch disappointed, and recording a bogey on 17 — the only hole of the tournament where both went over par — nearly took them out of the running altogether. A chance at staying near the top of the field came down to Isgar making a six-foot putt for birdie on the last hole of the course. Holding true to the team’s plan of playing off each other’s strengths, Isgar tapped the ball exactly where it needed to go and sealed their score at five under par.
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With signed score sheets and a small sense of relief, the two headed to the clubhouse to await their fate. As hours ticked away and team after team came in, Powell and Isgar’s 66 kept them in second place. Their coaches and teammates flooded their phones with congratulatory messages while their competitors told them how much fun they would have in Oregon during the Four-Ball Championship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Bears knew it wasn’t over until the last golfers left the green. Three hours later, another pair posted a 66. Powell and Isgar would have to face off against another team for a chance at the championships.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When we realized we were in a playoff, we were in total shock because we thought we were in at that point,” Powell said. “We had to get our wits together.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The teams went back to the start of the course for the sudden-death style round, but pars from both pairs meant they had to keep playing. The pressure-packed playoff continued on the eighth hole where things seemed to lean in the Bears’ favor from the fairway. Isgar yelled at his shot to “be good” as he hit the ball, but he couldn’t see where it landed. It turned up 30 feet from the pin, and the perfect putting opportunity was born.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Powell made par. Both golfers on the opposing team made par. Isgar had the last shot, the one final chance at solidifying a place in the Four-Ball Championship, and he wasn’t going to play it safe.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Everyone wants to be the hero,” he said. “I love being over the ball when it counts and when it means something. This was certainly no exception.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Standing 30 feet from a spot in a USGA event and a trip to the renowned Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, Isgar gave it his best shot. And then, he watched it roll.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“About halfway there, I knew that ball had a good chance of going in. About three-quarters of the way there, it looked really good,” he recalled. “And then it dropped in.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As far as Isgar remembers, the ten seconds after the ball plunked into the cup are a blur, but Powell was able to fill in the details, calling his teammate’s celebration “dramatic.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Probably everyone throughout the golf course, maybe the whole city of Lincoln could hear me scream when it went in,” Isgar said. “It was a good moment.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In eight months, Powell and Isgar will represent Brown golf on “the biggest stage,” said Head Coach Michael Hughes, adding that this will help the team recruit as the duo brings national exposure to the program.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maybe the storybook ending was a result of the lucky green shirt or the fact that Isgar needed to make that putt to get back to campus in time for a 6 p.m. lab. Regardless of how they claimed the spot, the two teammates, friends and roommates will attend their first USGA event together. And when the moment was over and he had calmed down and stopped celebrating, Isgar still made it back to Providence by 6:02.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: It’s time to sack the new roughing the passer rule</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Monday night’s game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers should have been notable only for excitement and competitiveness. The Buccaneers, led by Ryan Fitzpatrick, rallied from a twenty point deficit, falling just short in a 30-27 Pittsburgh win. But the game had long since been derailed by the NFL’s new roughing the passer rule. When Tampa Bay’s Jason Pierre-Paul lightly tapped quarterback Ben Roethlisberger on the head, Roethlisberger hurled himself down to the ground with a Neymar-worthy flop, a symbol of all that has gone wrong with the league this season. The uproar that followed drowned out any conversation about the game’s result. The NFL needs to fix itself and undo its previous mistakes, or the entire year could similarly go off the rails.</p>
<p class="p3">Before the season, the NFL made it a “point of emphasis” for referees to enforce a rule that states defenders cannot land on the quarterback with their full body weight. The Competition Committee planned to have the Officiating Department “emphasize that the defender is responsible to avoid landing on the quarterback when taking him to the ground.” The problem? Try running at an object, tackling it, then not landing on it with any body weight. It’s almost impossible, and it’s certainly not a reasonable expectation.</p>
<p class="p3">The rule has already had a major impact on the season. Clay Matthews was unfairly penalized for roughing the passer twice in two weeks. The first penalty played a big role in what became a tie between Green Bay and Minnesota, costing the Packers the win. The second was an even more egregious call. Matthews sacked Alex Smith while trying desperately to shift his body weight and not land on the quarterback. His effort was met with yet another 15-yard penalty. What happens when a major playoff game is won or lost due to this rule? What if it loses a team the Super Bowl?</p>
<p class="p3">Players have spoken out against the rule. Houston Texans’ defensive end J.J. Watt tweeted that “Roughing the Passer calls are absolutely out of control.” The 49ers’ cornerback Richard Sherman, in response to a tweet that said “(what) happened to the league we all love,” added simply, “Wish I knew.”</p>
<p class="p3">The rule has also been the direct cause of one serious injury already. Miami’s William Hayes tore his ACL while trying to avoid landing on the Raiders’ quarterback Derek Carr. Instead, he awkwardly contorted himself, twisting his limbs, and is now out for the season. A rule designed to protect against injuries led to one. It clearly doesn’t work as intended. “I wish the guy would have just landed on me instead of tearing his ACL,” Carr later said.</p>
<p class="p3">All the roughing the passer penalties significantly drag down the value of a defensive line. What’s the point of getting to the quarterback if you’re not allowed to touch him? The very nature of the game is different. If the rule does not change, quarterbacks should flop whenever a defensive player stands in their vicinity to draw a call. Far more troubling, why wouldn’t a pass rusher choose to disregard the rules completely and destroy a quarterback with a vicious, dangerous hit, if it carries the same penalty as merely tapping them on the helmet?</p>
<p class="p3">The Competition Committee met Wednesday night on a conference call to discuss all the roughing the passer penalties. But I’m not overly optimistic about what came out of that meeting. NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations Troy Vincent announced that “the committee determined there would be no changes to the point of emphasis approved this spring or to the rule.” With that in mind, I find it likely that problems with the rule will continue until next offseason (albeit not at the current rate), when the NFL can quietly correct its mistakes and not have to admit defeat.</p>
<p class="p3">The problems we have seen this season are indicative of the current crisis facing the NFL. How exactly do you make an incredibly violent game like football safer in the first place? But here, the NFL has prioritized the safety of quarterbacks over the safety of everyone else. There is nothing safe about a huge defensive player twisting and turning himself in unnatural motions to avoid a normal tackle.</p>
<p class="p3">If the NFL really wants to make sacks safe, they should put flags on quarterbacks and have it done flag-football style. At least that way, a completely changed game would be safer in reality. Instead, we’re stuck with a version of football that’s less fun to watch and as dangerous as ever. Let’s hope the NFL makes the right decision before this season is lost.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">As of last weekend, the University of Rhode Island men’s soccer team had not given up a goal in six games or lost a contest all season. That is, until Brown midfielder Matthew Chow ’20 came along. Saturday night, Chow knocked in a golden goal game-winner in the final minute of double overtime to send the Bears to a crucial 1-0 victory against the Ocean State rival. Entering the matchup, the Rams were ranked 23rd in the country and boasted an impressive defense.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chow, a junior from Vancouver, Canada, earned Second Team All-Ivy honors in both his freshman and sophomore campaigns. This season, he is tied for second on the team in goals scored. For his outstanding performance against URI, Chow has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>Herald: Congratulations on scoring the game-winner! What was going through your head while you were playing against such a highly ranked team in overtime?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chow: It felt great actually. It felt good to be the team that beat them. They were unbeaten for six games and hadn’t allowed a goal. It was actually a really good team effort. We grinded through the first couple of halves and then OT. And with one minute left, I scored the goal and everything came into place. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>How did you feel when you scored the goal?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Just excitement and adrenaline. Everyone came down and we celebrated in the corner. It was a great atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>When did you first get into playing soccer?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was at the age of four or five. I played with my little community team in Vancouver.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>When did you start to consider the possibility of playing college soccer?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">(From) when I was very young — I was part of the (Major League Soccer) team the (Vancouver) Whitecaps. They had a little youth academy, and I was a part of that youth academy growing up all the way until the age of 17 or 16.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Why Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">It’s an Ivy League school, of course. Academics really matter, so that was a big part of it. Also, when coach showed me around and talked about his philosophy in soccer, I was really impressed with that. That ultimately was the deciding factor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Do you have any pre-game rituals?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I tie my laces … in a lot of knots. I’m a Catholic, so I pray at times.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>What has been the highlight of your soccer career so far?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">(In) my sophomore year, I had a pretty good game against Penn. I scored a goal to get us to OT, but ultimately we lost that game. But I thought that goal was a pretty good moment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>What are your team and personal goals for the season?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Team goals (are) definitely to win the Ivy League and get a ring. This is my third year, and we haven’t gotten a ring yet. But my goal every season is to win the Ivy League and get a ring and enter the NCAA tournament. Personally, there are a lot of specific goals. Just playing true to myself and what I believe. … Statistically, maybe try to score more than eight goals.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will return to action when they host Columbia at Stevenson-Pincince Field Saturday at 7:05 p.m.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><i>This interview was edited for length and clarity.</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The football team took the field against Georgetown University Sept. 29, just one day before the one-year anniversary of its last victory. Needless to say, the team was hungry for a win, and Bruno delivered in dominant fashion Saturday, defeating the Hoyas 35-7 at Brown Stadium. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We won. That’s a great takeaway,” said Head Coach Phil Estes. “We played pretty well in all three phases. We got off to a great start … (and) set the tone.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">From the opening drive, it was evident that this game would be different for the Bears (1-2, 0-1 Ivy). Quarterback Michael McGovern ’21 used his running skills and strong arm to earn timely first downs as the team converted a fourth down as well as a third and 11 to keep the series moving. To cap the drive, McGovern found Jakob Prall ’20 in the back corner of the endzone on a fade pass to give the Bears an early touchdown lead over Georgetown (1-4). </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s a fun time. You always have to be ready, especially in college,” McGovern said. “When my number got called I thought I was ready, and I just let my performance do the speaking.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the start of Bruno’s next possession, disaster appeared to strike. On the first play, a high snap nearly resulted in a safety and pushed the Bears back to their own one-yard line. Most teams would run the ball to get some room to safely punt, but the Bears put their chips on the table and fired a play-action pass from the endzone to Jaelon Blandburg ’20 for an important 16-yard gain. From that point forward, the gridiron slanted downhill for the Bears as McGovern marched his offense the length of the field. On third and 7 on the Hoyas’ ten-yard line, Prall took a reverse handoff and galloped into the endzone to put Brown firmly in control of the game. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By the end of the first quarter, the Bears had amassed a 14-0 lead, while Georgetown only had possession for about three minutes. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">McGovern “has been great,” Estes said. “He’s got a good sense of what is going on around him. He’s made plays with his feet as well as throwing it downfield. We can get better for sure, but he’s been outstanding and seems like he gets better every game.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The start of the second quarter saw the Bears continue the onslaught as Sebastian Dovi ’19 made a diving interception on the Hoyas’ sideline to end a promising Georgetown drive. As the Hoyas’ defense started to clamp down on Brown’s offense, a muffed punt killed Georgetown’s momentum and gave Bruno the ball on the four-yard line. Two plays later, Prall again had the ball in his hands, running into the endzone for another touchdown. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At half-time, the Bears led 21-0, and had only given up 94 yards and forced three turnovers. McGovern was 16-26 with 163 yards and a touchdown. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the beginning of the second half saw a reborn Georgetown offense take the field. Hoya quarterback Gunther Johnson used his legs to escape the pocket, and running back Jackson Saffold helped move the ball against the Bruno defense. Joshua Tomas took off for the endzone on a 17-yard sweep to put the Hoyas back in the game. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There were just a few hiccups in the second half,” Estes said. “They made some adjustments, and the quarterback started to run the ball a little bit.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Georgetown’s newfound life did not last for long, as McGovern and the Bears responded forcefully. McGovern narrowly escaped a sack and launched a deep pass to the opposite side of the field to running back Allen Smith ’22. Smith took off toward the endzone, but could not beat the safety and was tackled at the four-yard line. On third and goal, McGovern again escaped the pocket and barely snuck inside the pylon for the touchdown. With the score, the Bears led 28-7. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The rest of the matchup belonged to the invigorated Bears defense, as it halted three Georgetown drives at the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth on fourth down. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears got the ball back with about seven minutes left in the game and went on a long, clock-killing drive to effectively end the contest. With 48 seconds to go, Smith punched in a touchdown on a third-down run for the final score, as the Bears took a 35-7 lead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">McGovern finished the game 23-42 with 269 yards, one passing touchdown and another rushing touchdown. The Bears’ offense had no turnovers while the defense recorded three takeaways. Prall ended the contest with one receiving touchdown and two rushing touchdowns, all in the first half. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re just taking it one game at a time,” McGovern said. “Now our complete focus is on (The University of Rhode Island). We’re going to try to get a win on them and get back into Ivy League play.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will take to the road next week to face URI in the Governor’s Cup Saturday at 1 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nugent &#039;21: Don’t sleep on the Dodgers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to write off this year’s National League on the road to the World Series. On Friday, the New York Yankees joined the Houston Astros and the Boston Red Sox, all American League clubs, at the 100-win mark. The best teams in the National League, the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers, sit at only 95 wins. Even the Oakland Athletics, a team headed for just the second wild card in the AL, has more wins than any team in the senior circuit. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the team to be worried about as the playoffs begin can be found in the NL — L.A. It’s true the Dodgers didn’t crack triple-digit wins and only earned a playoff spot in the final weekend. They also finished even with their division rival the Colorado Rockies, a tie that led to a 163rd game to decide the division winner tonight. Regardless, a closer look at the standings reveals what the team’s overall record doesn’t immediately show. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Dodgers win when it counts, and nothing counts as much in baseball as October. Ninety-one wins in an MLB season is no easy feat in and of itself, but the way the Dodgers have picked up those wins is what makes them particularly dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The simplest metric that predicts how a team will perform when the rubber hits the road is to look at its record against winning teams. When the Dodgers have come up against teams over .500 this season, they’ve won 50 — more than any other playoff team — and only dropped 38. None of the 100-win American League teams have more than 41 wins against winning-record opponents. By overall winning percentage, those AL teams have had more success, but the Dodgers’ road to October has been paved with harder-fought victories. It’s one thing to win, but it’s another to beat good teams and beat them consistently.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I wrote a few weeks ago about the reasons the Cleveland Indians shouldn’t be given preferential playoff treatment for beating the weaker teams in their division. Their win total against teams better than .500 only restates the point that Cleveland is not as good as their record indicates. Not only has Cleveland won fewer than half as many games against good teams as the Dodgers, but they have a losing record against L.A. this year. At only 23-31 against teams with winning records, don’t expect Cleveland to hang around long in October. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All of this only matters, of course, if it has any bearing on the postseason. Against the other four NL playoff teams, the Dodgers have played to a 24-15 record, or a .615 winning percentage. Shrink the sample size down to a best-of-five or best-of-seven series, and the Dodgers are easily clear of their necessary winning percentage. Obviously, baseball isn’t played on paper, and a couple of bad games could still mean that the curtains will close for L.A. Even so, the Dodgers have positioned themselves to do well. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Against the Rockies, which the Dodgers will face in a one-game playoff to determine the NL West champion, L.A. is 12-7 on the year. That puts game 163 in Los Angeles and takes away Colorado’s mile-high home field advantage. Even if the Dodgers can’t muster a win in that game, they’ve assured themselves a wild card berth and need only a little bit of luck to find themselves in the NL Division Series. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last year’s Dodgers team won 104 games on the way to a World Series loss. At first glance, this year’s team is a tier below that one. However, the 2017 Dodgers were only 36-33 when faced with teams above .500, and they came within a win of a Commissioner’s Trophy. This year, bolstered by deadline acquisitions in Manny Machado and Brian Dozier, and with most of last year’s pieces still in place, the Dodgers look dangerous. Don’t be surprised if, a month from now, L.A. is celebrating its first World Series title in 30 years.</span></p>

		<title>Women’s soccer edged by Columbia 2-1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following a 2-0 loss to Dartmouth last weekend, the women’s soccer team looked to capture its first Ivy League victory of the season in the conference home opener against Columbia Saturday. Despite Rebecca Rosen’s ’22 game-tying goal late in the second half, the Lions responded with a goal of their own to put them ahead 2-1 with just 44 seconds remaining on the clock.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The result marked Brown’s (4-6-1, 0-2-0 Ivy) fourth consecutive one-goal loss to the Lions (5-4-1, 2-0-0) in as many years, with all four of the winning goals having come in the 88th minute or later.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite the loss, there were a number of positive takeaways from the Brown side.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m really proud of the team for leaving it all out there and still fighting with minutes left in the game,” said Head Coach Kia McNeill.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Columbia started the game firing out of the gate. Brown’s defense absorbed most of the initial pressure until the 19th minute, when Columbia’s Amaris Hemmings broke through. Hemmings finished off a loose ball near the penalty spot following a corner kick to put the Lions up 1-0.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But as the sun set over Stevenson-Pincince Field, the Bears’ confidence grew, and they responded to the goal with attacking threats of their own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(The goal) was a small setback, but it was early on in the game,” Rosen said. “I had all the confidence in the team that we would step it up. We gained momentum in the second half of the first half and kept it going throughout the rest of the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was about telling ourselves that we had the tools to win the game,” said defender Lauren Hinton ’22. “We all had that forward-thinking mindset to get the ball to our top scorers. We were all on the same page.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Scoring opportunities were certainly present, as the Bears outshot the Lions 13-3 in the second half and 20-8 overall. In the 65th minute, Abby Carchio ’20 curled a free kick from just outside of the box around a six-person Columbia wall into the waiting arms of the keeper. In the 83rd minute, Sara Bermudez ’22 headed a free kick from Maesyn G’Bye ’22 just over the crossbar. Bruno remained goalless through the first 87 minutes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“At the end of the day, you have to put the ball in the back of the net in order to compete in these games,” McNeill said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But in the 88th minute, the Bears evened the game at one. G’Bye lofted a free kick from midfield into the box that Rosen redirected into the left side of the net for her second goal of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Rosen is one of the best players in the league in the air, so anytime we have set pieces, we are looking to find her,” McNeill said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moments later, Brown pushed upfield once again. But a quick Columbia counterattack in the 90th minute, capped by Jordyn Geller slotting a shot to the right of the keeper, squandered the Bears’ hopes for a comeback. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bruno seeks to make a number of improvements as it continues Ivy League play over the next few weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We just have to get more clinical in the final third,” McNeill said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown needs to “keep having cohesion in the back and keep working on that defensive shape,” Hilton added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears travel to Princeton (6-2-2, 1-0-1) next weekend in search of their first league win. They will face a tough Tigers squad that has suffered its only two losses to nationally ranked opponents in #13 North Carolina State University and #10 Georgetown.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Down two sets to none against Penn last weekend, the women’s volleyball team needed a spark. The Bears found it in outside hitter Gabrielle Moriconi ’21, who led Bruno to a 3-2 victory with 16 kills, six digs and four blocks. A native of Naples, Florida, Moriconi has recorded double-digit kills on six occasions this season, including Saturday’s comeback win at Penn. She also notched a team-high 11 kills against Princeton last Friday night. For her outstanding performances during the Bears’ Ivy road trip, Moriconi has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Herald: The team came back from two sets down to beat Penn in five — how did that win feel for you?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Moriconi: It felt awesome. I think we started off pretty slow in the first two sets, coming off of our loss from Princeton. We were just really looking for that turnaround and that breakthrough in our season to start winning in conference and put everything together. We finally did that in the third set and the end of the second, really turned the game around, and it felt great. We were all really excited about it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>You had 16 kills in the game. What does it feel like to contribute that much to the team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It feels awesome to be able to focus on my job, do my job and have that impact for the team. That’s a great feeling. Everyone’s able to trust each other to do their jobs and play their roles for the team.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Being two sets down and closing out the game with three close sets, did you feel confident that you could pull out the win as a team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yeah — I think the entire time, the whole game, we felt that we were the stronger team and knew that if we played our game, … we could pull through and win. It was just a question of okay, how are we going to turn this on, make this work and actually play our game now.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>You also led the team in kills the day before at Princeton — do you feel like you’re finding a rhythm with the team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yeah, of course … every player kind of searches for their rhythm, especially after a coaching change and getting new freshmen on the team and everything. It definitely feels good to be connecting with the setters and working to do my job as best I can.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Your twin sister Camberly Moriconi ’21 also plays on the team. What’s it like to get to play with her?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s amazing. We’ve always played together and so we know how to push each other. We know the little things that we’ll say, the little things that we’ll do. There’s really no one else like that, so it’s really nice to have that built in.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>The win against Penn puts the team at 1-2 in the Ivy League so far. How are you feeling going into the rest of the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Excited. We’re optimistic. We definitely needed, like I said before, that turnaround. And I think we did have one of the tougher schedules, having Princeton and Yale first, the two defending co-champions. That’s tough. But we were looking for that breakthrough win, that turnaround — we knew it was going to happen, and that if it didn’t happen in that game, it was going to happen in the next one. … So, we’re excited for the rest of the season.</span></p>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: The Baseball Hall of Fame needs to look beyond the numbers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was in New York last weekend to see David Wright’s last game as an active player. Wright played third base for the New York Mets, and has done so since 2004; at the end of the 2018 season, he played his last game, brought down by a deadly combination of back and shoulder injuries. The paid attendance on Saturday night, when Wright started at third for the last time, reached almost 44,000 — the Mets’ highest home attendance this season besides Opening Day. Wright took two at-bats and then left the field in the top of the fifth. There was not a dry eye in the house, and Wright’s final standing ovation lasted so long that the congratulatory song the Mets were playing ended before the clapping did.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It really makes you think, or at least, it did to me: How can players like this not be Hall of Famers? Or alternatively, there’s a broader question: How should the Baseball Hall of Fame treat players like this — who may not have the typical qualifications to earn entry — but are beloved by their fans, and have become leaders and even captains of their teams? To me, the answer is obvious: These players belong in the Hall of Fame. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Now, I’m not just talking about Wright, because that would be nothing more than my fandom talking. I mean this whole class of players. Players universally beloved and respected by baseball experts and fans. Players who may not quite have the statistical records to match up with historical Hall of Famers, but all the same give off an unmistakable, almost indescribable sense of greatness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Interestingly enough, another example offered itself up almost immediately after the Mets game. The day after Wright played his final game, Joe Mauer of the Minnesota Twins appeared to do the same. Mauer used to be a catcher; after multiple concussions he became a first baseman and designated hitter. Mauer’s and Wright’s stories are almost identical. Both were unquestionably elite offensive players but both fell short of conventional Hall of Fame levels. Both spent their entire careers with a single team from 2004 to 2018. Both became the unquestioned leaders of their teams. And both will now fade, apparently, into baseball oblivion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Let me cover all my bases, literally and figuratively. Here are two other similar players: Dustin Pedroia and Jorge Posada. Both spent their entire careers with a single team, the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees respectively. Both were offensively elite for their positions — second base and catcher, both usually positions from which relatively little offense is expected — but not to Hall of Fame levels. And both are almost universally respected. I am a well-known Yankee hater, and even I appreciate the career that Posada had. After Pedroia retires, similarly, I suspect that he will also be held in the same esteem. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">These four players — Wright, Mauer, Pedroia and Posada — do not have the raw numbers to make the Hall of Fame. That much I concede without argument. But the Hall of Fame induction process should be about more than numbers. Obviously, to some extent it already is: Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens are not in the Hall of Fame right now because they cheated, even though their numbers are better than most anyone else’s. Roberto Clemente, after the plane crash that took his life as he attempted to fly earthquake aid to Nicaragua, was inducted into the Hall of Fame immediately rather than going through the traditional five-year waiting period. This wasn’t because his numbers were better than anyone else’s — it was because of the person that Clemente was, which made the tragedy of his death hurt all the more.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With players like the four I’ve listed, the Hall of Fame should take a similar, holistic approach. The Hall should be a repository for baseball greatness, and baseball greatness comes in many forms. It’s not just the ability to hit 600 home runs or bat .340. Rather, sometimes baseball greatness manifests itself in other ways. The unparalleled resilience of David Wright. The hardworking consistency of Dustin Pedroia. The quiet leadership of Jorge Posada. The pain and perseverance of Joe Mauer. The Hall should recognize this and induct players like these four.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Critics will say that this opens the door for any everyday player to undeservingly become a Hall of Famer, but that argument falls short. It fails for the simple reason that it assumes these qualities are a dime a dozen. Things like Wright’s resilience and Pedroia’s consistency aren’t easy to find. If they were, there wouldn’t be anything special about any of these players, and it’s evident, from the love they generate from their fanbases and the universal respect they command throughout baseball, that there’s something special about each of them. Just like it’s not easy to hit 600 home runs, it’s not easy to be a great leader. They’re different kinds of talents, but both are forms of greatness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">After the Mets game on Saturday ended with a 1-0 Mets walk-off win in the 13th inning — I was tearing my hair out in the stands by then — Wright came back out onto the field for the last time and addressed the crowd. “I wish I could thank everybody individually,” he said. “But the best I can do is say thank you from the bottom of my heart for accepting me, thank you for cheering for me and thank you for allowing me to live out my dream in front of you guys, each and every single night.” He stopped for over 20 seconds while we applauded. Then he said, “you’re going to make me cry again. I love you guys.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Greatness, as I say, isn’t hard to recognize. Let’s just hope Hall of Fame voters were listening.</span></p>

		<title>Men’s water polo upsets No. 12 Princeton</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The men’s water polo team capped off an exceptional weekend with an 11-10 win over the No. 12 Princeton Tigers Sunday at the Katherine Moran Coleman Aquatics Center. The Bears earned an early 3-0 lead and never relinquished it thanks to a standout defensive performance from goalkeeper Riad Hallal ’21 and hat tricks from center-defender Travis Bouscaren ’19 and center Hudson Rawlings ’20. The win helped Brown avenge a prior loss to Princeton earlier in the season, a 16-11 defeat on the road Sept. 29. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After Saturday’s wins over the MIT and No. 7 Harvard, Brown (11-7, 4-2 NWPC) had significant momentum heading into its conference home opener against Princeton (10-6, 3-4) Sunday. The Bears capitalized on their energy and got off to a fast start, holding on for a one-point win despite Princeton having a late opportunity to tie. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bouscaren opened scoring for the Bears, and teammate Matt Simko ’22 soon followed with another goal. Meanwhile, Hallal held steady on the defensive end with multiple early saves. Santiago Nunez ’19 netted an impressive long-range shot to give the Bears a commanding 3-0 lead after the first period.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown Head Coach Felix Mercado commended his team’s strong start. “Our defense, without a doubt, was on point. We limited (Princeton’s) looks on the cage. Also, by pushing the pace on offense, we forced them to play defense, which got them off rhythm,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Princeton managed to rebound offensively in the second period, with Keller Maloney scoring two goals for the Tigers and Mitchell Cooper earning one. However, goals by Bouscaren, Rawlings and Spencer Carroll ’19 enabled Brown to trade points with Princeton, and the Bears entered halftime with a 6-3 lead. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the third period, it appeared that Princeton was ready to mount a comeback. Brown’s offense stagnated with just one goal in the frame from Armen Deirmenjian ’20. With the Tigers down 7-5 as the period came to a close, Maloney made a long-range buzzer-beating shot to cut the deficit to just one and put the pressure on the suddenly vulnerable Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“They are a good team, so it was really difficult to hold them like we did in the first half for two halves. They are a very capable team of going on a run,” Mercado added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Brown stepped up in response to the adversity. Hallal kicked off the final frame with a leaping block to prevent Princeton from tying up the score. Then, Bouscaren completed his hat trick with a goal to give the Bears an 8-6 lead. Still, Princeton’s offense was in its groove, and each time Brown found the back of net in the fourth, the Tigers answered with a score of their own soon afterwards. As a result, Brown clung to a 10-9 lead with about two minutes left, even after two more goals from Rawlings.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Princeton had a crucial opportunity to tie the game as they had possession with under a minute left and were down by just one. Brown’s defense came up big, and the Tigers lobbed it over the net for a turnover. Carroll iced the game for Brown with a score to put them up 11-9, and a late conversion on a penalty shot was too little, too late for the Tigers. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hallal, who keyed the exceptional defensive effort by the Bears with nine saves, credits his team’s win to their energy level in the pool. “We’ve had some bad losses where we (didn’t come) in with enough energy. When we get amped up and excited and go in guns blazing, we play really well,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bouscaren attributes part of the victory to his team’s frustration with their struggles from earlier in the season. “As we started losing, we developed an underdog mentality. … We were just sick of losing and knew this might be the last time we play this team before the championships,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown has broken out of its early-season form. After capping off a 3-0 weekend, the Bears seek to carry momentum into its remaining games. Next up for Brown is the Harvard Invitational in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which will present another challenging weekend. Among the teams the Bears will face at the tournament are No. 18 Wagner and No. 20 Bucknell. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brown and the University of Rhode Island have met on the gridiron 103 times since 1909, but the Ocean State rivalry has never been so one-sided. Though the Bears have traditionally dominated the series against the Rams, Bruno was defeated 48-0 on the road Saturday in a game that marks Brown’s largest recorded loss to URI.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have to understand that URI (4-1) is a very good, ranked … team who is polished and outplayed us for 60 minutes,” wrote tight end Anton Casey ’19 in a statement to The Herald. “The biggest issue today was the overconfidence that came after the (win against Georgetown) and taking Rhode Island lightly.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears (1-3, 0-1 Ivy) started the contest looking like the team that had defeated Georgetown the weekend prior, as its defense was able to stall a promising Rams drive and hold URI to just a first quarter field goal. Later in the quarter, URI drove to the outskirts of the red zone, and Brown pounced on a fumble by Rams quarterback Vito Priore to gain possession and attempt to shift momentum.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Brown’s offense was stuck in neutral all day. Quarterback Michael McGovern ’21 faced consistent pressure and was sacked seven times as the Bears could neither sustain a drive nor exploit promising opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Offensively we missed too many assignments throughout the entire game,” wrote running back Darius Daies ’21 in a statement to The Herald. “When one of us isn’t doing our job, it trickles throughout the entire squad and makes it hard to get things going.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the second quarter, the Rams caught fire, outscoring Bruno 24-0. The deluge started just a minute into the period, when Priore found wide receiver Aaron Parker in the back right corner of the end zone for a 19-yard touchdown pass. On the Rams’ next drive, Priore fired a 38-yard strike to put URI in scoring position and then followed up with a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Isaiah Coulter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Football is a team game,” wrote defensive captain Michael Hoecht ’19 in a statement to The Herald. “As a defensive unit we have to defend the pass better, both from the defensive line rushing the pass and defensive backs covering their receivers.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Down 17-0 with five minutes left in the half, the Bears were in desperate need of a game-changing play. URI faced a 4th and 5 at Brown’s 35-yard line but converted on a 33-yard pass to Parker in a drive that would end in a Rams field goal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the next drive, the Bears managed to move the ball past midfield thanks to a face mask penalty on running back Allen Smith ’22, but they missed a 48-yard field goal and gave the Rams good field position with under two minutes left in the half.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Two plays later, Rams receiver Marven Beauvais caught a deep pass, spun away from the Brown defensive back and waltzed into the end zone to put the Bears in a 27-point halftime hole.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the second half, the Bears came out of the locker room deflated, giving up two touchdowns and throwing an interception in just the first six minutes of the third quarter. In the fourth, URI added to its lead with a 25-yard touchdown pass to receiver Khayri Denny for the final score of the game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Today, offense didn’t execute particularly well, as the score indicated, but I think one thing we could have done better is establishing a run game early on so that teams can’t key in our pass offense as much,” Casey wrote. “The first thing we need to adjust is execution on offense (both run and pass) as well as preparing better for our opponent.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the final whistle sounded, the Bears were outgained on offense by a margin of 580-127 yards. URI recorded 26 first downs compared to just eight from Brown. McGovern was 11-27 with 101 yards and a pick, and Chima Amushie ’21 led all receivers with 23 yards, followed by Jaelon Blandburg ’20 who posted 21 yards.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re approaching Ivy League play as a new season,” Daies wrote. “It’s a chance to forget about all the good and bad from prior weeks and make a name for ourselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will begin its slate of Ivy League contests this week as the team travels to play Princeton Saturday at 1 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The men’s water polo team earned three crucial victories last week, beating Harvard 11-9 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 11-10 in a double-header before defeating Princeton 11-10. Travis Bouscaren ’19 delivered an exceptional performance in the pool, recording six goals, three assists and three steals for the week. He also notched the overtime game-winner against MIT to help the Bears get their season back on track.</p>
<p class="p4">Bouscaren, a senior from Cambridge, Massachusetts, plays center defender for Bruno and earned Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches All-Academic team honors in the past two seasons. For his outstanding play last week, Bouscaren was awarded Northeast Water Polo Conference Player of the Week and Brown Student-Athlete of the Week honors and has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the big wins against Harvard, MIT and Princeton last week. How does it feel to get those victories and earn NWPC and Brown honors?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Bouscaren: Honestly, after our little rocky start to the season, it was really good (reassurance) that we’re the team that we know we can be, … so, it felt really good. We were all really desperate for a win, and the desperation for a win is what partially fueled our achievements. I’ve never gotten the Player of the Week from the (NWPC), so that was really cool to get. It was honestly an honor to get it from Brown too. While it doesn’t mean as much to me as the wins, because that’s not a team effort, it’s really cool to get recognized like that.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>When did you first start playing water polo?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I first started playing water polo in my freshman year at high school. I went to Phillips (Academy) Andover, and I was always a swimmer coming in. They made every person play three sports, so I decided that I would try water polo because all of the swimmers said it was really fun. Luckily, it was much more fun than swimming, so that’s how I ended up getting recruited to Brown.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Why did you choose Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p4">A main part was the environment and the atmosphere that I got from Brown. I came on an official visit, and I just had the greatest time with the team. Unfortunately, none of those guys that I first stepped on the team with are still here. But this season, I’m trying to play in their memory because they are what made Brown Brown to me, and I want to make that same experience for my freshmen now. Also, the coach, Felix Mercado, was definitely the best coach that recruited me — most personable, most funny and just seemed like the kind of guy that I wanted to play for. Then, just meeting with the team, it just seemed like the clear choice. There was really no other option.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>What has been your favorite moment of your time with the water polo team?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Honestly, this past weekend was one of my highlights at Brown. Especially as a senior, when we’re leading the team — me, (Spencer Carroll ’19) and (Santiago Nunez ’19). It’s our responsibility to keep this team in check, and we’ve been struggling to win before. But this past weekend, we really came together as a team. Everyone had the goal of winning and being the strongest team out there. To see the team come together like that was something that I was hoping for for so long, and to see it come true was my favorite memory.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Do you have any pre-game rituals?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I think a pre-game ritual, especially (before) that first game away from Brown, is waking up with my roommates, (Carroll) and (Nunez), and going to get (Bagel Gourmet Olé), getting a coffee from them and always debating on how much to eat. You want to eat enough to have fuel but not enough to feel fat, so we usually end up eating half to three quarters of our bagels and debating on if we need more or not.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>What are some of the team’s goals moving forward for the rest of the season?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Our main goal is to win every game we play. The next game is always the most important game, and for us, that’s going to be (Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Colleges) Saturday morning. In terms of general team goals, we want to create a practice environment where everyone is excited to come play, brings energy, releases everything else that they had going on that day, comes to practice with a fresh mind and (is) ready to give it all for the team. That’s how we’re going to be better and win championships, and it’s hard to set a goal of winning championships when it’s a couple of months away, so you need to have a goal for each day. That’s coming to practice with a good attitude and making that practice as fun and competitive as it could possibly be.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>What are you concentrating in and what do you hope to do after graduating?</b></p>
<p class="p4">I’m concentrating in neuroscience, and I hope to go to (medical) school. I plan on taking at least a gap year, or a year off, to study for the MCAT and maybe travel and explore the world a little bit — get away from studying and working out my brain so much before med school.</p>
<p class="p4">The Bears will return to action in the Harvard Invitational Saturday and are slated to play Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Colleges, the University of Toronto, No. 20 Wagner College and No. 17 Bucknell University.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">While the football team improved on last season’s 53-0 defeat against No. 21 Princeton, the Bears’ efforts were not nearly enough, as they fell 48-10 to the Tigers on the road Saturday. For the second week in a row, and for the third time this season, the Bears’ defense gave up more than 40 points. The offense, which seemingly came alive against Georgetown two weeks ago, has dramatically regressed — Bruno was shutout by the University of Rhode Island last weekend and could only muster 10 points on the Tigers’ stout defense.</p>
<p class="p2">“I think a lot of what went wrong today on offense was in our control,” wrote quarterback Michael McGovern ’21 in a statement to The Herald. “We need to clean up the mistakes and have all 11 guys on offense do their job, and we’ll be very successful.”</p>
<p class="p2">From the opening snap, the Bears (1-4, 0-2 Ivy) were in trouble. Princeton quarterback Kevin Davidson, in the first start of his career, found Steven Carlson for a 39-yard gain on the first play from scrimmage of the game. A pass interference penalty a few plays later put the Bears’ defense on the ropes, and the Tigers (5-0, 2-0) capped the drive when Davidson found Ryan Quigley in the end zone. Just 154 seconds into the game, Bruno was down a touchdown.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown’s offense could not get anything going on their first series, and the Tigers responded on their next drive with a 62-yard touchdown strike from Davidson to Jesper Horsted. Horsted caught the ball at around the 25-yard line, but had the angle on the safety and took off for the end zone to put the Bears in an early 14-point hole.</p>
<p class="p2">For the rest of the quarter, Bruno’s defense looked up to the task of stopping the robust Princeton offensive machine. It halted a Tigers series and forced a 4th down on Princeton’s next two drives. But at the start of the second quarter, the wheels fell off for Brown. Tigers running back Charlie Volker converted a 4th and 1, and Davidson found a leaping Horsted in the end zone on the very next play.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears’ offense continued to be plagued by drive-killing penalties and missed opportunities. On Brown’s next drive, the team fumbled two snaps and had a punt blocked to give the Tigers the ball at midfield.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’re (going to) watch the film, find the mistakes and fix them,” McGovern wrote.</p>
<p class="p2">The Tigers seamlessly passed the reins of the offense to quarterback Zach Keller in the second quarter, and he led a 58-yard march in just 90 seconds. Volker scored a 22-yard touchdown to finish the drive and give his team a 28-0 lead.</p>
<p class="p2">Though the Bears blocked a Tigers field goal and embarked on a promising drive before the end of the quarter, Princeton was firmly in control, leading by four touchdowns at the half.</p>
<p class="p2">In the third quarter, McGovern led the Bears on a nine-play, 43-yard drive that resulted in a field goal and broke a scoring drought that had lasted over one and a half games.</p>
<p class="p2">The Tigers quickly re-established their dominance from the first half and followed up Bruno’s field goal with two touchdown drives of their own to put the score at 42-3 with 12 minutes left in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="p2">In the waning moments of the game, Brown finally reached the end zone to cap a 75-yard drive. Running back Allen Smith ’22, who scored the Bears’ last touchdown two weeks ago against Georgetown, galloped 13 yards for the score.</p>
<p class="p2">Princeton went on a long, clock-killing drive for another touchdown before the final whistle sounded, handing the Bears a 38-point loss.</p>
<p class="p2">“As a defense, we just needed to finish plays,” wrote defensive captain Michael Hoecht ’20 in a statement to The Herald. “We let a few sacks, tackles and interceptions slip away that could have changed momentum. We were put in the right positions — we just need to make the play when our number is called.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears were outgained 556-222 on offense and only recorded 15 first downs, compared to 27 from the Tigers. McGovern was 17 for 29 from the field with 146 yards and an interception. He was also sacked five times.</p>
<p class="p2">“Now we’re going to learn from our mistakes in this past game and get better for Cornell,” McGovern wrote.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We don’t need to change the plan, we just need to execute it.”</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno will return home to face Cornell at Brown Stadium Saturday at 1 p.m. during Family Weekend.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Golden State Warriors are an early championship lock</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Believe it or not, the NBA returns this week. With so much going on in the world of sports during October between the MLB playoffs and football season, it can be easy to put basketball on the back-burner. That being said, the start of the NBA season should be fascinating. How will LeBron James look in Laker gold alongside Lonzo Ball, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley? Will Kawhi Leonard feel comfortable in Toronto and turn the Raptors into true Finals contenders? What can we expect from Trae Young? There are plenty of intriguing questions to ask. Unfortunately, I can’t say with any honesty that the end of the NBA season will be quite so interesting. Because let’s face it: The Golden State Warriors are winning the 2018-19 season, and there’s nothing any other team can do to stop them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fans of the Celtics, Rockets, Raptors and maybe even Lakers may shout in rebuke. The Celtics won 55 games last season and went all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals without Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. With those guys back healthy, and further growth from Jayson Tatum and Jalen Brown, the Celts will be much improved since last year. The Rockets took the Warriors to the brink of elimination in 2017-18, holding a 3-2 lead in the Western Conference Finals before disaster hit in the form of an ill-timed Chris Paul injury. If Carmelo Anthony can manage some semblance of a positive contribution, then Houston will be back and dangerous. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Raptors won 59 games and captured the first seed last year — now they’ve swapped out DeMar DeRozan, who has underperformed in the playoffs, for Leonard, a former Finals MVP. There’s a viable path for this team to win over 62 games. The Lakers have LeBron, and anything can happen with the King on the court. He’ll arguably have a better supporting cast this season with Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma. LeBron dragged Jeff Green, George Hill and Tristan Thompson to the Finals last season in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston — surely there’s a chance he can pull off the magical yet again?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But all this hope and optimism is for naught. The Warriors were the best team in NBA history with Javale McGee and Zaza Pachulia at center. Now they’ve added DeMarcus Cousins. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cousins comes with plenty of question marks. He’s returning from a torn Achilles that will need rehabbing for a good part of the season. He’s known for being a problem in the locker room, sometimes a downright negative influence on his teammates. He occasionally slacks off on plays and doesn’t give his best effort. At the end of the day though, this is still Cousins, and 80 percent of Cousins at his best takes the Warriors to another level. This is a guy who was an MVP candidate before the injury, averaging 25.2 points and 12.9 rebounds per game. Imagine a starting lineup of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins. That’s an Olympic-level lineup of basketball talent. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 28-year-old center fits in terrifically with Golden State. Cousins can score down low when needed, an asset that adds yet another dimension to the Warriors’ offense. Now they can pummel opponents in the paint if shots aren’t falling at certain points in the game. Cousins can also knock down three-pointers, meaning all five Warriors are able threats from the perimeter. Of course, he is an adept passer as well. The ball movement could be ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even if Cousins cannot fit seamlessly into the starting lineup, he can always provide scoring punch off the bench with the second unit, a weakness for the Warriors in the playoffs last year. With Andre Iguodala increasingly injury-prone, Golden State won’t have to rely on him and Shaun Livingston to the same extent. Cousins can dominate against lesser bench players, especially in four-minute spurts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Golden State doesn’t need Cousins to rush back and play to his normal level right away. He can take his time and ease back into games. The Warriors are only counting on him come April. And at the end of the day, they still have Curry, Thompson, Durant and Green. They don’t exactly need a ton of help.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So yes, there are a few teams out there that have championship aspirations. But no one comes close to the Warriors. The Celtics lost to a Cavs team that was swept in the Finals. Are Irving and Hayward enough to make up the difference against a championship Warriors team plus Cousins? The Raptors need Leonard to stay healthy and fit in with the team and even then, they will most likely be underdogs against the Celtics in the Eastern Conference. The Rockets peaked last year — can Paul stay healthy, Anthony contribute and the Warriors decline? Beyond doubtful. The Lakers are another star away from title contention. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’m locking in my Finals pick early: Warriors in 4. Doesn’t matter who they’re playing.</span></p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: There’s hope yet for some of the NFL’s floundering franchises</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">We’re steadily nearing the halfway point of the NFL regular season, and the first part of the year has featured some surprisingly successful teams. The Miami Dolphins currently stand with a 4-2 record, coming off a stirring victory against Khalil Mack and the Chicago Bears. The Kansas City Chiefs went from a solid, low-ceiling playoff team to an absolute juggernaut, boasting the league’s best offense. The Cincinnati Bengals and Baltimore Ravens look ready to battle the Pittsburgh Steelers for the AFC North’s top spot all season long. But on the other side, some franchises that expected to compete this year might be in big trouble, namely the Atlanta Falcons (2-4), San Francisco 49ers (1-5) and New York Giants (1-5). Do any of these teams have hope for a turnaround?</p>
<p class="p4">The Falcons were supposed to contend again in the NFC South, fighting for position with the New Orleans Saints and Carolina Panthers. Unfortunately, their roster has been absolutely shredded by injuries. Atlanta lost Pro Bowl safety Keanu Neal and linebacker Deion Jones at the very beginning of the year — Neal to a knee injury and Jones to a foot injury. While Jones may return by season’s end, for now both remain on injured reserve. To make matters worse, safety Ricardo Allen tore his Achilles in late September, and he too is out for the season. There simply is not much talent left on the defensive side of the football for Atlanta, and the Falcons have struggled to stop anyone as a result. They’ve given up 32 points per game, the second-worst in the entire league.</p>
<p class="p4">Atlanta must be saved by its offense, and I still do believe that the Falcons can resurrect their season. Fantasy owners may complain about wide receiver Julio Jones’ lack of touchdowns, but he’s on pace for over 1,800 receiving yards and gives rookie wide receiver Calvin Ridley lots of room to operate and succeed in. Running back Devonta Freeman is headed to IR with groin surgery, but considering the state of the NFL — how pass-heavy the league is now — the Falcons can still succeed on offense with Jones, Ridley and quarterback Matt Ryan. Lots of fans worried about Ryan’s health and ability after his struggles against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 1, but he looks as good as ever, on pace for 37 touchdowns and only five interceptions. The Falcons host the Giants this Monday night. A win will move them to 3-4, and they play the Redskins, Browns and Cowboys afterwards. Not exactly a fearsome bunch. If they can tighten up the defense only a modest degree, this team can still hang around and try to grab a wild card spot at season’s end.</p>
<p class="p4">Speaking of those Giants, the situation in New York is looking rough. WR Odell Beckham Jr. has not shied away from vocalizing his issues with the team, and owner John Mara spoke out strongly in response, saying OBJ should do “a little less talking.” A lot of discussion concerning the franchise has centered on the decision to draft running back Saquon Barkley instead of a quarterback like Sam Darnold with the second overall pick. The argument goes that while Barkley may be taking the league by storm and looking like the best running back in the game, his position’s value is miniscule compared to quarterback, meaning that Barkley can’t help the Giants in the way Darnold would have. And many of the Giants’ problems on offense do come from quarterback Eli Manning. The two-time-Super Bowl Champion looks washed up, and can barely throw the ball 20 yards at this point.</p>
<p class="p4">However, how much could Darnold help if he had to spend his rookie season running for his life? Manning barely has any time to throw the football; the Giants’ offensive line has been porous. New York could be in a far better position if it continues on with Barkley and Beckham, then either drafts a quarterback next year or finds one in free agency — and of course, shores up its line. With so much talent on offense, New York can’t be held in check forever. So though they may not have any hope for this season, next year has potential for the Giants.</p>
<p class="p4">The 49ers face a lot of obstacles in their path back to respectability. The enthusiasm felt in San Francisco at the start of the season is gone thanks to Jimmy Garoppolo’s torn ACL. C.J. Beathard has done an admirable job of filling in, but Garoppolo is the face of the franchise, and the team must start back at square one next year. Jimmy G will need time to recover his form on the field, and even longer to show signs of his sky-high potential. Add in running back Jerick McKinnon’s torn ACL and you’ve lost two key pieces on offense to disastrous injuries.</p>
<p class="p4">It’s really the worst case scenario for San Francisco, but there have been flashes of good news. Running back Matt Breida has rushed for a ridiculous 6.8 yards per carry thus far. If he stays healthy, Breida can be the future at running back for the 49ers. Tight end George Kittle is on pace for over 1,100 receiving yards and will be a real weapon for Garoppolo once he returns. Yet in the end, it’s a rough year to be a 49er fan. Hopefully the condition of the team looks a lot brighter in 2020.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Carleen Jeffers ’19 led women’s cross country to a seventh place team finish out of 28 squads last weekend at the Penn State National Open. A senior from Ridgewood, New Jersey, Jeffers finished tenth individually in a field of 289 runners in the six-kilometer dash with a time of 20 minutes, 53 seconds. Building on her strong finish as well as a 17th place effort at last month’s Coast-to-Coast Battle in Beantown, she looks to lead the Bears to success in conference competition at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championship Oct. 27.
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For her standout performances on the course, she has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: You finished tenth overall and led the team at the Penn State Open. How did it feel to place so highly?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Jeffers: It felt really good. It was one of those races where we had nothing to lose so we were kind of just going to see how we stacked up against our competition. I think as a team, and for a lot of us as individuals, we surprised ourselves with what we were able to accomplish.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>You also posted a top-20 time at a race last month in Boston. Do you feel like you’re finding a groove?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Definitely. I felt like Boston was kind of a rust-buster, in a sense. It had been like seven or eight months since I had last raced because I was injured in the spring. I thought that Boston was solid, but I definitely felt like at Penn State both myself and our team as a whole took a big step forward, which is really great because we have our conference meet coming up in two weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>The team has gotten some big contributions from first years so far. Does that give you more confidence going into future meets?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Yeah. I think the biggest thing is that we’re so deep right now and that our spread is really tight. Meaning that from our first runner all the way back to like eight or nine we have a really, really tight spread, which is great for cross country. I think that’s the biggest, most important thing for our team right now.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>The team is hosting the Rothenburg Run on Friday. Entering the meet, what are you looking forward to?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I’m not actually racing in that, but that meet serves two purposes. One is like, for people trying to make the conference roster to kind of see what they can do and prove themselves in that way. Then, the second thing is people who are on the comeback train right now coming back from injury or illness or whatever it is, still building their way into cross country … they’re able to get a race opportunity that way.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Last month, the team climbed to second in the Northeast rankings. How do you feel about the rest of the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I’d be lying if I said we weren’t really excited about that, but at the same time I think our entire season’s motto has just been even keel, don’t get too high, don’t get too low. And at the end of the day, those regional rankings don’t really matter — what matters is what we do on the day. So, I think we’re more excited for that and we’re more excited for what we actually will do than (how excited) we are for what people think we can do. But it’s definitely motivating and it’s something that’s on all of our minds for sure. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>As a senior, how do you feel about this being your last season at Brown?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">It’s definitely been a time of reflection, especially like you said with all the freshman contributions that we’ve been having. It’s been reminding me of kind of where my mind was freshman year and just what a different athlete, what a different person I am. And I’m just so, so grateful to the coaches and the team that I’ve had here at Brown for these four years because the team culture that we’ve cultivated is unique, definitely, among all other NCAA (Division I) teams. … I just really appreciate that and have been able to see it for what it is as a senior. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s3"><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Men&#039;s basketball goes undefeated in Brown Bears Tip-Off Classic</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The men’s basketball team had a perfect weekend at the Brown Bears Tip-Off Classic, knocking off the University of Massachusetts Lowell, Sacred Heart University and Army West Point to earn a 3-0 record for the tournament. The Bears’ potent offense, led by guard Desmond Cambridge ’21, allowed them to race out to an early lead in all three games and hold on for a win each time.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown’s strong tournament represented an emphatic rebound from an 0-2 start to the season, in which both losses came by three or fewer points. Guard Brandon Anderson ’20 said that the Bears spent the days before the tournament “focusing on the things that we need to do individually to help the team be successful, and it showed this weekend.”</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno (3-2) took on the UMass Lowell River Hawks (3-3) Friday in its first game of the weekend. Josh Gantz and Alex Rivera helped the River Hawks to an early 13-6 lead in the first half, but the Bears quickly bounced back. Bruno took an 18-16 advantage after a strong run led by two three-pointers from guard Chris Sullivan ’19 and harnessed the momentum to take a 45-30 lead into halftime. Though the persistent River Hawks refused to back down, drawing within four points of the Bears in the second half, Brown stood firm for the 82-74 win.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown’s second game of the weekend was a similar story, as the Bears raced out to a 42-28 halftime lead over the Sacred Heart Pioneers (2-3). The Bears maintained a comfortable advantage for the first nine minutes of the second half, but an 11-0 Pioneer run, which included nine points by Sean Hoehn, cut Brown’s lead to just three with 9:42 remaining. Although Sacred Heart hung close with Bruno for the remainder of the contest, a gritty finish enabled Brown to keep ahead and earn an 82-77 victory.</p>
<p class="p2">In the final game of the tournament, Brown downed the Army Black Knights (1-4) with a score of 86-66. Eight three-pointers in the first half powered the Bears to a 20 point halftime lead, and this time Bruno remained comfortably ahead as there was no second-half surge by the other team. The closest the Black Knights could come in the second half was within 19 points as Brown cruised to its third triumph.</p>
<p class="p2">“Our defense was sound and solid throughout, and that’s why they weren’t ever able to make an established run,” said Head Coach Mike Martin ’04 about Brown’s performance against the Black Knights.</p>
<p class="p2">Cambridge put up a total of 61 points over the three games, including a 25-point scoring outburst against Sacred Heart. Other key contributors included forward Tamenang Choh ’21, who averaged 8.7 rebounds per game throughout the tournament and posted a double-double against Army, and Anderson, who averaged 9.3 points per game on the weekend. Cambridge, Choh and Anderson were named to the Brown Bears Tip-Off Classic All-Tournament Team, and Cambridge was named Tournament MVP.</p>
<p class="p2">Guard Zach Hunsaker ’20 believes the Bears’ ability to build momentum helped them jump out to early leads in each game. “When we get those open shots and get that first one going, we get into a rhythm,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Anderson also acknowledged the Bears’ offensive prowess and said that Brown’s defense made the difference this weekend. “Last season we were basically outscoring teams to win, and this season we know we’re going to score,” he said, adding that it is only a question of “can we get the stops.”</p>
<p class="p2">The fast-improving Bears will look to carry this weekend’s momentum throughout the rest of their non-conference schedule. They host Division III opponent Salve Regina Wednesday, before facing Bryant in a Sunday showdown.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On a windy and cold autumn afternoon, the women’s soccer team warmed up the home crowd’s spirits with a 3-1 victory against Cornell. The Bears fell behind early but battled back to tie the game before halftime and take a commanding lead in the second half. With the victory, Bruno moves into sole possession of sixth place in the Ivy League standings.</p>
<p class="p2">“Our team has showed a lot of resiliency this season,” said Head Coach Kia McNeill. “We just had to be patient in the final third and wait for the opportunities to come to us.”</p>
<p class="p2">From kickoff, the Bears played aggressively and pushed the ball back into Cornell’s zone. In the opening minutes, though the Big Red could not sustain possession in the face of Brown’s tenacious offensive effort, the Bears were unable to generate promising scoring opportunities.</p>
<p class="p2">Eight minutes into the game, midfielder Abby Carchio ’20 launched a curling rocket from just outside of the goal box, but the shot landed directly in the arms of Cornell netminder Meghan Kennedy.</p>
<p class="p2">The tide quickly shifted for the Bears as the Big Red earned possession and threatened with free kicks. Brown headed the ball out of bounds and gave Cornell a corner kick in the 11th minute. The Big Red capitalized on the opportunity and scored on a header by Evanthia Spyredes off of the corner kick to give Cornell its first goal since its 2-1 loss against Columbia Sept. 22.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite the early hole, the Bears began to regain momentum and returned to dominating possession of the ball. In the 19th minute, forward Jennifer Caruso ’19 passed the ball into Cornell’s goal box and came inches away from connecting with forward Claire Myers ’22. Moments later, forward Star White ’21 shrugged off a Big Red defender in the goal box and launched a shot, but Kennedy made an impressive leaping save to preserve Cornell’s lead.</p>
<p class="p2">Midfielder Megan Grant ’19 almost earned her first goal of the season for the Bears, but once again, Kennedy stifled Bruno with a lunging save in the top left corner of the net. In the 36th minute, defender Maesyn G’Bye ’22 sent a powerful shot, but Kennedy dove for the save.</p>
<p class="p2">Just before halftime, the Bears struck gold on a free kick from Carchio. Carchio launched the ball from outside of the goal box, and it glanced the head of forward Rebecca Rosen ’22 and snuck behind Kennedy to tie the game.</p>
<p class="p2">At halftime, the score was knotted at one. The Bears had dominated in all other aspects of the game, outpacing Cornell 12-1 in shots and 7-1 in shots on goal.</p>
<p class="p2">To start the second half, the Bears continued to keep their feet on the gas against the Big Red. G’Bye was fouled in the goal box in the 52nd minute, and Carchio took the penalty shot and placed the ball into the bottom right corner of the net to give the Bears a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p class="p2">“I knew I had to put those ones away,” Carchio said. “I have a great team behind me. People drew the fouls for me, and I just stepped up.”</p>
<p class="p2">As the half wore on, both squads traded possession and Cornell tried to capture momentum, but neither team could find the back of the net. In the 75th minute, Caruso had some space in the goal box, but her shot roamed just wide of the goalposts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p2">To ice the game, White was fouled in the 89th minute, and Carchio had another chance at a penalty shot. This time, she masterfully placed the ball in the bottom left corner to give the Bears an insurmountable 3-1 lead.</p>
<p class="p2">When the final whistle sounded, Brown’s impressive performance was evident in its stats. Bruno outshot the Big Red 22-4 and led in corner kicks 5-4.</p>
<p class="p2">“We have to get back to the drawing board a little bit and go over a couple of things that I think we can clean up in this game,” McNeill said. But this was “certainly a game to build off of. Anytime you score three goals in the Ivy League, that’s good momentum to feed off of, so I’m just really proud of the result.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears will travel to Philadelphia this weekend to take on first-placed Penn Saturday at 4 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As of late Saturday night, it’s that time of year again: the World Series is upon us. The Boston Red Sox, possessors of an MLB-best 108 regular-season wins, will take on the Los Angeles Dodgers, back-to-back National League champions with a star-studded lineup and a Hollywood shine. But as the series begins and inevitably produces its share of great moments, it’s important to remember where baseball happens. It doesn’t happen in the clubhouse or on the streets of its teams’ cities or in the broadcast booth. Rather, baseball is played the same way it always has been: on the field.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s critical to remember this because media coverage of the World Series will inevitably devolve into narrative journalism and focus not on the games themselves but on what they mean and why. There are so many different narratives we might see that it’s hard to know where to start, but I’ll give it a shot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We might see “East Coast/West Coast,” with the old-fashioned, 13-colonies era Red Sox taking on the newfangled, Brooklyn-transplant Dodgers. If this becomes the predominant narrative, it will quickly take over all facets of the game: The Red Sox will play “old-school” baseball, the commentators will assure us, while the Dodgers are high-tech and fancy. Who will triumph, the old guard or the upstarts? The narrative quickly mutates from a true yet inconsequential fact about the two teams to an overarching theme that, in baseball media’s collective mind, comes to define every moment of the series.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or we might see a variant on the geographical narrative, the oft-described “working-class” Red Sox versus the Hollywood Dodgers. Fenway Park, the World Series broadcast will assure us, was built by hardscrabble Boston construction workers, maybe part-time sailors or dockworkers, the cream of the working class. Dodger Stadium, meanwhile, has palm trees! Movie stars! Los Angeles, the city of stars, versus Boston, in many ways the heart of old-time America… It’s easy to see how this narrative could take over, even though in practice, when two teams take the baseball field, it doesn’t mean anything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve seen this in the past: In fact, we see it every year. In 2017, it was the Astros, those heartland Astros, living out the prophecy that Sports Illustrated set out for them in 2014 (June 2014: Sports Illustrated calls the Astros “Your 2017 World Series Champs”). In 2016, it was the Cubs breaking the Curse of the Billy Goat — a more salient narrative than most, to give baseball media credit. And in 2015, it was the Royals, suddenly “America’s team,” darlings of the media, taking on the no-good New York Mets. The Royals were working harder, being “relentless” (whatever that means), hustling so hard that it was practically impossible for the Mets to do anything but bend the knee in surrender. Every year, something new comes up: The World Series goes from two teams playing baseball games to a full-fledged story, with villains and subplots and everything. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And of course, it’s all utter nonsense. The fact that the Red Sox play in Boston doesn’t mean they’re the metaphorical descendants of Paul Revere and company, just as the fact that the Dodgers play in Los Angeles doesn’t mean they take after Marilyn Monroe. The Red Sox and the Dodgers are two baseball teams — two of the best baseball teams in MLB, but all the same, just two baseball teams — and there’s no need to add more to the story than that, besides for gratuitous reasons. If Andrew Benintendi gets a key hit in game one, it won’t be because he’s showing “Boston grit” or some variant thereof; it’ll be because he’s a good baseball player. And likewise, if Justin Turner makes a play to win a game for the Dodgers, he won’t be “embracing the Hollywood spotlight,” or however else FOX’s announcers decide to put it; he’s just another good baseball player doing his job. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I don’t know which narrative will take over this year’s Fall Classic; maybe it will be one I’ve mentioned, or maybe it’ll be the Dodgers’ return to the World Series for a second straight year. More than likely, it’ll be something I haven’t even come up with yet, or maybe we’ll get lucky and get nothing more than straightforward baseball. I certainly hope that’s the case: Narrative sports journalism, when wrongly applied, takes the fun out of the World Series. It takes a series that two teams are fighting very hard to win and says to fans who may be undecided about the outcome, “Root for this team for these ridiculous reasons.” Just let the Sox and the Dodgers play out the series. A hard-fought, competitive series is the best story there is, and there’s no need to enhance it with hastily constructed issues that, in the grand scheme of baseball, matter not one bit.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b>Women’s Hockey</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The women’s hockey team opened its season with a series sweep over College of the Holy Cross, earning a 3-1 win Friday and 4-0 shutout victory Saturday. The weekend was highlighted by clutch performances from goaltender Calla Isaac ’20, who recorded 32 saves for her first-career shutout, and forward Lizzy Gross ’22, who notched a hat trick to eclipse the Crusaders (0-5-2) Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday night, the Bears (2-0) brought their home rink to life as they made their 2018-19 debut at Meehan Auditorium. Fourteen minutes into the first period, forward Bridget Carey ’19 finished a rebound to give Bruno an early lead. Reilly Maeve scored for the Crusaders early in the second, but Jacquie Tam ’22 responded with her first career goal three minutes later. Sena Hanson ’20 cemented the victory late in the third by launching a shot top shelf past the shoulder of Holy Cross netminder Jada Brenon.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the crease, Isaac made 24 saves. The Bears were clean on the penalty kill and fended off the Crusaders for the win. Bruno outshot Holy Cross 28-25.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, the team travelled to Worcester, Mass., to complete the home-and-home series. Gross put the Bears on the board with a power play goal halfway through the first stanza. Carey followed six minutes later and found the back of the net straight after winning a faceoff. The following two periods saw goals from Gross, which included an unassisted tally in the third, to secure the sweep for Bruno. Forward Shay Maloney ’22 posted three assists for the evening, and the Bears killed off a total of seven penalties to preserve their clean slate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno will take the ice against the University of Connecticut at Meehan Auditorium Tuesday before opening conference play at Quinnipiac University Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Men’s Water Polo</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The No. 16 men’s water polo team (15-10, 4-2 NWPC) finished competition at the Julian Fraser Memorial Tournament Oct. 21 with an 11-3 win over No. 19 San Jose State University (6-12). The Bears completed the weekend with victories over San Jose State, Fresno Pacific University and No. 18 Loyola Marymount University and a single loss from No. 15 California Baptist University. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Travis Bouscaren ’19 led the team in points with three goals, and Riad Hallal ’21 led defensive efforts and made 12 saves in net. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hudson Rawlings ’20 and Aidan Reilly ’21 also notched a pair of goals each to fuel the Bears to victory over the Spartans.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown will reopen conference play against Iona College and St. Francis College Brooklyn Oct. 28 at the Katherine Moran Coleman Aquatics Center. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Men’s and Women’s Crew</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The men’s crew team finished the 54th Head of Charles Regatta in third place in the men’s championship four with a time of 17:25.418 and championship eight events with a time of 15:07.230. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the same competition, the women’s crew team finished seventh in the women’s championship four race with a time of 20:22.866. The squad posted an 11th place effort in the women’s championship eight with a time of 17:39.070. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Men’s crew will close out the fall season Nov. 10 at the Foot of the Charles after the women’s squad wraps up competition at the Princeton Chase Oct. 28.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Men’s soccer draws in defensive battle against Hofstra</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Coming off a heartbreaking loss Saturday to the Cornell Big Red, the men’s soccer team hoped to rebound against a tough Hofstra University squad Tuesday night at Stevenson-Pincince field. Though a spirited defensive performance led by five saves from goalkeeper Max Gross ’21 helped the Bears keep a clean sheet, Hofstra’s defense also held steady and the game ended in a 0-0 draw. Brown completed a four game homestand with its match against the Pride and finished 2-1-1. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hofstra (7-5-4, 4-2-1 CAA) presented a difficult non-conference match-up for the Bears (7-6-1, 1-3-0 Ivy), as the Pride had gone through an eight-game period earlier in the season without allowing a goal, including a 0-0 draw against No. 21 UNC-Wilmington. Given this, the Bears considered Tuesday’s draw a positive result. “We came off a tough loss and wanted to show we had some energy and fight, and we did that,” said team captain Gabe Welp ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though no goals were scored, the game had plenty of action, especially in the early minutes. In just the third minute, a corner kick for Hofstra allowed George O’Malley to attempt a short-range shot, which clanged off the post. Immediately afterwards, John Vrablic ’21 made a transition drive down the field but his shot was barely saved by Hofstra goalkeeper Leo Arkhanhelskyi. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hofstra put consistent pressure on the Brown defense early. Bruno bent, allowing four Pride corner kicks in the first 12 minutes, but did not break, as Hofstra could not convert on their opportunities. Brown recovered and mounted their own attack, including multiple shots by Derek Waleffe ’22. One of Waleffe’s attempts was impressively saved by Arkhanhelskyi with one hand in the 16th minute, while another attempt<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>just missed the net in the 19th.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Play slowed down for the remainder of the first half, although each team had another good opportunity to take the lead before the break. Hofstra’s Storm Strongin had a great chance at a short-range score, but Gross slid in for the clutch save. Nathan Plano ’21 similarly had a low shot blocked in the 36th minute.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Both defenses continued to crack down in the second half, with solid scoring opportunities becoming few and far between. Bruno’s best chances of the half came when Toby Howell ’19 controlled the ball inside the penalty box in the 66th minute but sent a slow roller wide, and a shot from Justin O’Brien ’19 that clipped the crossba</span><span class="s1">r. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With no scoring during regulation, the teams went to overtime. Overtime had been one of Brown’s strengths up until this game — previously, Bruno was 3-0 in overtime games this season. But it was not to be this time, as the Pride defense proved impenetrable. In the second overtime, Daniel Schiller ’20 and Matthew Chow ’20 had shots on goal that could have given Brown the walk-off win, but both were corralled by Arkhanhelskyi. Strongin also had a late attempt to win it for Hofstra, but hit the crossbar. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As time wound down, action between the teams got chippy, with O’Malley and O’Brien each picking up a yellow card in the final two minutes. But neither team could net an overtime score.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gross, whose performance in goal was crucial to Brown’s clean sheet, credited his teammates with the strong defensive effort. “We won a lot of headers around the box, got a lot of clearances and did a good job tracking our men,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Head Coach Patrick Laughlin was unsure if the Bears could have done any more to score a winning goal, despite the opportunities they created. “Our players were trying to convert, we just couldn’t finish,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the game against Hofstra completed, the Bears have wrapped up their non-conference schedule. Brown will resume their Ivy League slate on Saturday night on the road against Penn,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the only remaining winless team in Ivy League play.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The women’s hockey team opened its season in formidable fashion with a series sweep over the College of the Holy Cross last weekend. The Bears earned a 3-1 victory at Meehan Auditorium Friday before eclipsing the Crusaders in Worcester with a 4-0 shutout win Saturday. Bruno also notched four goals in the third period to earn a 5-3 comeback victory over the University of Connecticut at home Tuesday night.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saturday’s contest was highlighted by impressive performances from goaltender Calla Isaac ’20, who recorded 32 saves for the first clean slate of her career with the Bears, and forward Lizzy Gross ’22, who earned a hat trick on her first collegiate points. Isaac made 56 saves in total for the weekend and garnered ECAC Goalie of the Week honors, while Gross was named the ECAC Rookie of the Week for her offensive efforts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For their outstanding play on the ice last weekend, Isaac and Gross have been named The Herald’s Athletes of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: Congratulations on winning the series last weekend. What was that like, and how did it feel for you all to open your season so strongly?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isaac: For me, it was very different from the past two years for sure. Our team worked really hard, and we had a lot of offensive chances, which was really nice to see.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross: We knew we had something to prove, and I think we did this weekend and (Tuesday against UConn), and it’s because of our hard work during the preseason. … We just went to work and got the job done, which we just need to keep doing.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>When did you start playing hockey?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross: I was like three or four. My dad made a backyard rink and my older brother played hockey, so I started because of him and then just continued.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isaac: Basically the same as her — (my) older brother played and I was always at the rink, always watching and one day I was like ‘I really want to play this,’ so I started. I learned to skate when I was three or four but I think I actually started playing hockey when I was seven.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Did you play any other sports growing up?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross: Yeah, I played soccer and lacrosse all through high school, so last year was my last year for those two. So I was kind of sad to have that go, but hockey is obviously my main sport.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isaac: I played … junior high basketball, soccer, volleyball. I’m also on the track and field team here at Brown so I’m doing two sports right now.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4"><b>Do you have a favorite pro hockey team and a player you like to watch?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross: We’re (Detroit) Red Wings fans, even though I live in Maine — weird, I know. I always liked …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Patrick Kane and Pavel Datsyuk, those are probably my two favorites.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isaac: Definitely the Oilers, so Edmonton — that’s my hometown. They’re not generally the best team, but I still cheer for them. And then Carey Price.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Do you have any pregame rituals or things you do to get into the zone?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isaac: I like to throw balls against a wall and catch them for like half an hour, like a racquetball, and I have a reaction ball that I do too. That’s probably the extent. I always eat a banana.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross: Jacquie (Tam ’22) … (and I) like to play soccer before. We’ll try to beat our record in juggling.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Do you like to listen to music when you work out? What do you like to listen to?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross: Yes. In the gym, the song “breathin” by Ariana Grande reminds me of the Airdynes (laughs), so that’s a hard one to listen to, but I guess it gets us going.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isaac: I listen to my free Spotify when I’m working out alone, which kind of sucks. … (laughs) You only get like three skips, so the song that you don’t like comes on in a crucial part of your workout, and you’re like, ‘I have to wait three minutes now.’</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s3"><b>Has there been a most memorable experience in your Brown career so far?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross: Probably Saturday night for me, my first goal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isaac: For me, it was definitely (Tuesday) night just to see our team work so hard and come back. We have generally not fought so hard and just to see everyone work so hard and to have it pay off is amazing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross: Yeah, that game for me too — I think that’s the most excited I’ve been about a hockey game in a while.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4"><b>What’s your favorite thing about being on the women’s hockey team?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross: We’re all close already, it’s a super-close team friend-wise, … and everyone’s there for each other. I think that’s part of the reason we won (Tuesday) night because everyone wanted to be there for each other, everyone wanted to work hard for each other, so I like that.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isaac: I like working super hard, putting everything out there and seeing everyone around me in the same position — just super tired (and) exhausted, but still willing to put the extra effort in.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>What are your team aims for the season?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isaac: Make playoffs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross: Yeah. Be the hardest working team on the ice every day, every game.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears open conference play tonight at Quinnipiac University. Face off is at 6 p.m.</span></p>

		<title>Men’s hockey to open season against Yale, Vermont</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">As the lights turn on and the crowd gathers in Meehan Auditorium tonight, familiar sets of blades prepare to take the ice.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Opening its 2018-19 campaign, the Bears will begin their season with a pair of home contests, hosting Ivy rival Yale tonight before facing the University of Vermont (1-1) in a non-conference matchup this Sunday.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will lace up their skates following a month and a half of preparation on and off the ice. The team started training in late September and began official practices in the first week of October.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“The team is coming together very well,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “We’ve been working a lot each day on just having good habits, … making sure we’re doing the right thing every time we step on the ice and improving each and every day. Having that kind of accountability will ultimately lead to good things on Fridays and Saturdays when we play.”</p>
<p class="p4">This season’s team features a core group of 20 returning players, four of whom ranked among the top five point scorers in the 2017-18 season. Co-captain Tommy Marchin ’19 paced Bruno’s offensive efforts with a team-high 12 goals last year, followed by Assistant Captain Zach Giuttari ’20, who led defensemen with 16 points. Co-captain Max Gottlieb ’19 also returns to the squad after earning Second Team All-Ivy honors in his junior campaign.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to this trio, other members of the squad have also adopted leadership roles and contributed to a sense of cohesiveness among the team, Gottlieb said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“Other guys that aren’t (assistant captain) or (captain) do a really good job of keeping morale high and competing every day,” he said. “That’s what we kind of need from everyone if we’re going to go where we want to go this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p4">“Everyone has a leadership role,” Giuttari said. “We want everyone to help each other out, so it’s all about just building a team.”</p>
<p class="p4">Bruno has also added depth to its roster with a freshman class of six, including four forwards, one defenseman and one goaltender. The first-years have integrated well with the team and have delivered impressive performances on the ice so far, Marchin said.</p>
<p class="p4">“They know the roles that they should be doing, and in the scrimmages that I’ve seen, they are fulfilling those perfectly,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">The first-year class has also created a higher level of competition and developed a sense of team chemistry, Gottlieb added.</p>
<p class="p4">“These guys are right in there like they’ve been here for a couple of years, which is great because the competitiveness of every day is just that much better,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">As the season commences, Bruno looks to improve upon last year’s 10th place finish in the ECAC standings with an approach that emphasizes industry and everyday processes of improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“You always have to look at it with a growth mindset, so where we are today ultimately is not where we’re going to be in March when the puck is dropped in the playoffs,” Whittet said. “That being said, the day-to-day approach just means focusing on the process (and) understanding that each day is a new opportunity to improve.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The team needs to “take it day-by-day, step-by-step, shift-by-shift,” Giuttari added. “Every practice you have to be ready from the moment you step on the ice until you get off the ice. Even after practice ends and the coaches get off, we have guys always staying out there working on other stuff, whether (it is) shooting, skating (or) passing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The development of a team identity has also been a focus of this year’s squad, as the Bears seek to establish themselves as competitive opponents in the league and build the status of the program.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“This year … we’re really confident in how we’re doing and developing our own identity instead of trying to find one or (saying) that we have an identity then try to reach it — we’re kind of developing it ourselves,” Marchin said. “We want to go into games knowing that we can win, and we want other teams to know that it’s going to be a tough night playing against us and it’s going to be a battle.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">This weekend’s matches follow a 3-1 scrimmage victory over Princeton and 2-2 tie against Yale last Saturday. The Bears will play 29 games in regular season competition, which includes 22 conference contests before playoffs open in March. They will also compete at the Dartmouth Ledyard Classic and Three Rivers Classic tournaments in December and January, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“We’ve gotten off to a great start, especially with these games this past weekend,” Giuttari said. “We’re looking like we’re heading in the right direction this year, so we’re all really excited.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will face off against the Bulldogs at 7 p.m. at Meehan Auditorium.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chaos arrived in the first week of the NBA season. Chris Paul and Rajon Rondo fought over spit, LeBron James missed two clutch free throws to lose a game and Blake Griffin dropped 50 points. With all the wildness occurring around the league, I tried to make sense of the NBA’s current pecking order. The following are power rankings of the league’s top 10 teams. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>1. Golden State Warriors</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Surprise, surprise. Unless something drastic happens, I’m not moving Golden State from the top spot until the end of the season. The Warriors dropped a game to Denver but are truly coasting, not using a lot of their best offensive plays until the playoffs. It doesn’t matter if Golden State finishes with a No. 2 seed again — they’re the best team in the league by far. Stephen Curry is on a mission, scoring 51 points in three quarters on Wednesday night. Just wait until DeMarcus Cousins comes back. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>2. Toronto Raptors</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">There were a lot of questions to ask about Kawhi Leonard entering the season. Was he fully healthy? Would he be motivated enough to give his best in Toronto? Well, Leonard seems as good as ever. Once he shakes off the rust from his jump shot, he’ll be borderline unstoppable again, forming a dynamic duo with Kyle Lowry. The Raptors have perhaps the deepest team in the league from Jonas Valanciunas and Danny Green to Fred Van Vleet and Pascal Siakim. They look like the best team in the Eastern Conference. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>3. Boston Celtics</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">While plenty of people expected the Celtics to run away with the Eastern Conference this season, there are still some areas of concern for Boston. It’s hard to give so many talented players enough playing time. Terry Rozier already said, “It’s tough when I don’t get the minutes that I may want.” Not a great sign so early on. Nevertheless, putting Kyrie Irving, Gordon Heyward, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Al Horford on the floor is a recipe for success. Boston will go far, but the journey will have its challenges. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>4. Houston Rockets</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The Rockets have gotten off to a rough 1-3 start. Carmelo Anthony will take some time to adjust to his new bench role and won’t help a team much at this point of his career. James Harden and Paul still form an elite combination and Clint Capela continues to improve every year, but Harden’s hamstring injury is a major concern, and Paul’s health is always in question. Houston has taken a big step back from last year’s 65-win performance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>5. Utah Jazz</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The Jazz suffered a heartbreaking loss to the Warriors and a perplexing defeat at the hands of the Memphis Grizzlies early on, but they came back from a far worse situation last season. Donovan Mitchell moved past his early season struggles with a 38-point outing Wednesday against Houston. Joe Ingles, Rudy Gobert and Jae Crowder all appear to have improved in the off-season. Look for Grayson Allen to contribute as the season goes on too. The Jazz will vie for a high seed in the Western Conference. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>6. New Orleans Pelicans</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This team has surprised so far. The big man rotation of Anthony Davis, Nikola Mirotic and Julius Randle is impressive, and has led the Pelicans to an early 3-0 record. Davis can win the MVP this year if he continues his current level of performance, averaging 30.3 points, 13.0 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 3.3 blocks per game. He dominates on both ends like few can in the league. The Pelicans have more than maintained their momentum from last season’s playoffs. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>7. Denver Nuggets</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Coming off a frustrating season with unmet expectations, the Nuggets now look ready to compete for years to come. Nikola Jokic controls the offense, averaging 23.3 points, 10.5 rebounds and 7.0 assists per game, while Gary Harris, Jamal Murray and Paul Millsap provide lots of support. Harris has improved each season he has spent in the league, and could be on the verge of stardom. Though Denver lost Will Barton to hip surgery (he’ll be out for five to six weeks), there is still plenty of depth. The Nuggets are here to stay.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>8. Milwaukee Bucks</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The hiring of new head coach Mike Budenholzer gave Milwaukee fans plenty of reason for optimism, and the Bucks have lived up to expectations. Giannis Antetokounmpo will battle with Davis for MVP votes all season long, and is taking more three-pointers. Though not many of them have fallen yet, his new confidence from outside is a good sign. Khris Middleton makes for a perfect second option in an offense with his shot-making skills. Don’t be shocked if the Bucks end up stealing the third seed from Philly. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>9. Philadelphia 76ers</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">With Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, Philadelphia has sky-high potential. But after a largely quiet off-season, many of the issues that plagued Philly in the playoffs have returned: a lack of depth and players with difficulty shooting the ball. This season comes down to Markelle Fultz. Can the second-year player regain his shot and look like Philly’s third star? Without him, the 76ers will end their season earlier than hoped. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>10. Indiana Pacers</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Indiana surprised the league last year with an impressive campaign, ultimately falling short to LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games. They won’t surprise anyone this year. Victor Oladipo is a star and the addition of Tyreke Evans in the off-season gives the Pacers a further boost at the wing positions. If Myles Turner can finally make a leap in his level of performance, then Indiana can fully contend in the conference. For now, expect to see them as a four or five seed in the playoffs.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the rain-soaked and wind-whipped field at Brown Stadium, the football team found itself stuck in the mud in a loss to Penn Saturday. With the loss, the Bears remain the conference’s basement-dwellers and are at risk of completing their second winless Ivy League season in a row. Both squads’ passing attacks were useless in the face of heavy weather conditions, so the high-flying offense that college football showcases today was replaced by a ground attack more reminiscent of the Bears’ and Quakers’ first matchup in 1895.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We fought all the way for 60 minutes,” said Head Coach Phil Estes. “We got a lot of young guys playing that are learning as they play. There were some mistakes made that we have to correct, and it’s just a matter of going out there and taking advantage of some of the opportunities that we get.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The tone of this contest became evident in the first few drives of the first quarter, as Bruno and the Quakers traded short runs, punts and fumbles for most of the opening minutes. The only reprieve from the sloppy play came when Penn running back Karekin Brooks broke loose for a 63-yard run that put Penn in position to kick a 20-yard field goal and take a 3-0 lead. At the end of the first quarter, the Bears had negative one passing yards compared to just 13 from the Quakers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The conditions definitely weren’t ideal,” said quarterback Michael McGovern ’21. “But we always got to go out there and make plays. Today we came up short, but we’re on to the next one.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the second quarter, Penn’s offense began to get into a rhythm. Brooks eluded the defense for another big run — this time 46 yards ­— to push the Quakers down to the three-yard line. But the Brown defense stepped up and ripped the ball from running back Abe Willow’s grasp. Michael Hoecht ’20 jumped on the fumble and saved Bruno from falling into a deeper hole. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Brown could not hold off the Quakers forever. With less than three minutes left in the half, Penn quarterback Nick Robinson led his offense into the red zone and found Steve Farrell in the back right corner of the end zone on 3rd and 11. With the touchdown, the Bears found themselves facing a 10-point deficit. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno’s prospects for victory deteriorated again before halftime, as Penn regained possession with a bit more than two minutes to play. The Bears earned a stop at midfield, but a penalty for roughing the kicker on the ensuing punt gave the Quakers 15 yards and a first down. Penn capitalized on Bruno’s special teams error, and knocked in a field goal before the half to take a 13-0 lead. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown’s offense left much to be desired in the first half — the team had no passing yards, only one first down and 49 rushing yards. Meanwhile, the Quakers ran wild in the mud, and rushed for 211 yards in just 30 minutes of play. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the final two quarters, the Bears’ defense absolutely shut down the Quakers offensive attack. In the first drive after halftime, Bruno forced a turnover on downs, and after McGovern threw an interception deep in Bears’ territory, Brown blocked a field goal. But besides one punt after another, the rest of the quarter and the start of the fourth were devoid of highlights. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We all flew to the ball and we all played our assignments pretty well,” said linebacker Brendan Pyne ’20. “The coaches put us in good position for this game, and we just gave it our all.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the clock ticked towards zero, the Bears’ offense finally came to life. Wide receiver Scott Boylan ’21 escaped for a 28-yard run to put Brown in scoring position. But on the next play, McGovern was engulfed by the Quakers’ defensive line and fumbled the ball to end Bruno’s drive without critical points. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the Bears’ last chance of the game to prevent another shutout, McGovern led his team down the field for a touchdown. A 27-yard pass to Graeme Davis ’21 put the Bears deep in Quaker territory, and Jakob Prall ’20 capped the drive with a 20-yard touchdown reception with only 27 seconds to go.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We scored,” Estes said. “We got to do that more often.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The score cut the Quaker lead to six, but the touchdown ultimately was too little, too late. Brown attempted an onside kick, but Penn recovered, and ended any chance of a comeback by the Bears. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You’re always trying to score,” McGovern said. “It’s definitely nice getting the zero off the board. We’re just going to go into the next game the same as every other game — trying to get a win, stay confident, stay up (and) keep our heads high.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the final whistle sounded, the Quakers had outgained the Bears 370-195 in total yards, and 18-11 in first downs. McGovern was 9-19 with 93 yards, a touchdown and an interception in the loss. Boylan led Bruno on the ground with 44 yards rushing. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears have three more chances this season to earn a win in the Ivy League and climb out of the conference basement. Brown will travel to New Haven Saturday to take on Yale at 1 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The men’s hockey team opened its season with a pair of close contests this weekend, falling to Ivy rival Yale 3-2 Friday and recording a 2-1 loss to the University of Vermont Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A trio of Bears scored in the contests, including Tristan Crozier ’22 and Justin Jallen ’22, who posted their first career goals Friday and Sunday, respectively. Trey Dodd ’20 also recorded a pair of assists over the weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 2, Yale 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Friday night, Crozier and Brady Schoo ’19 each scored to equalize the game, but the Bears (0-2, 0-1 ECAC) were edged by the Bulldogs (1-0, 1-0) in a back-and-forth matchup at Meehan Auditorium.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Joe Snively put Yale on the board at the 14-second mark with a goal on the team’s first shot of the evening, but Crozier answered 10 minutes later for the Bears. Alone in the left circle, Crozier collected a feed from Alec Mehr ’21 and sent the puck past Bulldogs netminder Corbin Kaczperski to tie the game at one.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was a really nice pass by (Mehr) — our line’s been working really well,” Crozier said. “I just tried to get it off my stick as quickly as I could, and I was fortunate enough for it to go in the net.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Snively notched his second score of the evening, an unassisted goal off of a turnover, to give Yale a 2-1 advantage before the period was over. But Schoo responded two and a half minutes into the second frame, sending the puck rotating past Kaczperski catcher side on a wrist shot. Dodd and Jallen recorded assists on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Luke Stevens added a goal to reclaim the lead for Yale late in the second period. The Bears mounted a late offensive surge and peppered the Bulldogs’ net with shots in the third, outshooting Yale 13-4 in the stanza, but Kaczperski held off the attack to seal the victory for the Elis.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It would be really nice to get some more shots on net, and I think if we’re more tenacious on the forecheck, we’ll be able to turn over more pucks and hopefully have a better result in the end,” Crozier said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the crease, goaltender Luke Kania ’21 posted 23 saves. Brown went five-for-five on the penalty kill, denying Yale the chance to convert.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The penalty kill was excellent. … It was the best I’ve seen in a long time,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “We pressured very well, I thought we took away their time and space and I thought we took away their options.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve been doing a good job pressuring them both in their zone and in our zone” on the penalty kill, Jallen said. “We really want to force them to make a play they don’t want to make, and so far, it’s been working out for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 1, Vermont 2</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Two nights later, Bruno led the University of Vermont (2-2, 0-1 Hockey East) by one entering the third period, but the Bears were unable to maintain the advantage as the Catamounts notched a pair of goals for the comeback in the final frame.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears dominated possession and pressured the Vermont net early in the first, recording nine shots on goal during the period. Catamounts netminder Stefanos Lekkas was able to fend off Bruno’s persistent offense until Jallen found the back of the net late in the second stanza. Joachim Weberg ’21 came from behind the net and drove the puck into the crease, where Lekkas made the initial save before Jallen finished off the rebound.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Christan Evers equalized the game six minutes into the third with a power play goal for Vermont before Craig Puffer scored five minutes later to claim the lead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Netminder Gavin Nieto ’20 recorded 27 saves as the Bears were edged in shots 29-28.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the Bears seek to increase offensive production, Whittet emphasized the importance of playing with poise and composure in the zone.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We have to find a way to change angles where we’re shooting from, we have to find a way to miss shinpads (and) we have to find a way to get the rebounds,” Whittet said. “We’ve got to be a little calmer maybe around the net … (and) have a poise to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking ahead to a pair of visits to Colgate University and Cornell this weekend, the team maintains a positive and industrious approach.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our goaltending’s been really good, and I think that we’ve done a really good job outworking opponents,” Jallen said. “We just haven’t been able to find a way to win yet, but I think that’ll come with time, and if we continue to work hard, I think this team will find success very soon.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears will face off against Colgate Friday and Cornell Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s been nearly seven months since all 30 MLB teams broke camp with finalized rosters and plenty of lofty expectations. Now, seven months and 28 teams are gone. By the time of printing, that number may already be 29 with the 2018 season done and dusted.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But, despite all that, it doesn’t matter who wins the World Series. Red Sox or Dodgers, this year is a perfect illustration of why baseball is broken without a salary cap. Both teams started with a financial advantage that would be impossible in other sports and rode the slanted playing field all the way to the World Series. There is an elite in baseball, and while 30 teams play the game, only a select few have any realistic title aspirations. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By roster salary, the Red Sox rank first, followed closely by the second place Dodgers. Baseball is a money game, and the last few years have been no exception. The next two teams in the payroll rankings? 2017 World Champion Houston Astros and the 2016 champion Chicago Cubs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem isn’t that some teams have more money — that’s true in every sport — but rather the level of the disparity. Unlike the salary cap-enforced parity of the other three major sports leagues, the NFL, NBA and NHL, the distance from first to last in baseball is staggering. The lowest-salary MLB team, the Tampa Bay Rays, could fit their player budget into each of the four aforementioned teams’ salaries six times over. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If that kind of spending inequality continues to be allowed, small market teams will never have a real chance at the championship. Milwaukee almost bucked the trend this year, but only by spending big on Lorenzo Cain and selling the farm for midseason acquisitions. Even that came up short. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The last team to build a winner through smart drafting and development rather than outspending the competition was the Royals in 2015, but that win registered as an anomaly rather than a shift in power. And the Royals’ subsequent loss of the players that got them there when financial push came to shove shows that the small-market success window is too short. Without something stronger than the current luxury tax system, which lets the rich pay extra for the privilege of extravagant spending, we’ll sit around waiting for the once in a generation team like the Royals while the big market teams win rings by the dozen.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Which brings us to the 2018 World Series. The Red Sox do have a core of players developed by their own system, but where small market teams and big market teams really differ is the ability to retain those players and build around them. As the Royals built their World Series winner, they spent away the money that could have kept Eric Hosmer and Lorenzo Cain last year. Meanwhile, Boston can keep players around with ease while still adding the likes of David Price and J. D. Martinez on huge deals. The Dodgers likewise have the money to keep a Hall of Fame talent like Clayton Kershaw when he hits the open market, where a small market team would have to let him walk. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Every team in the three other major sports leagues has to consider the cap as they go after superstars or attempt to retain their own. As players like Joc Pederson and Mookie Betts hit free agency in the coming years, Boston and L.A. should have to do the same. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Coming back to the Cubs and Astros: While those teams are hailed for building cores through the draft and savvy trades, their World Series success was dependent on spending big money to add the one or two extra pieces to win it all. Both were back in the playoffs this year, and the Astros came within three wins of another World Series berth. The two also have payrolls north of $150 million. They may have grown into contenders as underdogs, but both teams’ sustained success comes from the same flawed salary system that gave us this year’s Fall Classic. Teams like the Rays can try to bluff their way into the playoffs on tiny budgets all they like, but without a change in the system, don’t count on it proving successful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So while it matters a great deal who wins the World Series to the fan bases of the two teams involved — and to plenty of people who hate the two teams involved — for baseball at large a coin flip would do just as well at this point. A system that almost invariably rewards big market money creates a caste system in Major League Baseball, and right now we’re seeing the top caste stomp out any competition. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s time for a change.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It started three years ago with a faded orange hat and an effort to bring a stoic first-year out of his shell. The result was a stage name that Peter Choi ’20 will perform under at the Brooklyn Bazaar Nov. 10 armed only with a microphone.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Alone in the basement of Wayland House, Choi set up a camera and took a step back. He introduced himself as ‘Peach’ and proceeded to perform a two-minute beatboxing routine he had been perfecting for months. Six minutes before the Oct. 5 deadline, he uploaded his submission for the American Beatbox Championships and took a shot at breaking into the elite level of competitive vocal percussion.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last November, Choi dove headfirst into the competitive beatboxing scene with only slight knowledge and no experience. The 2017 American Beatbox Championships was his first live beatboxing event, and he approached the open mic elimination round with little more than a rough draft of a competitive routine. Choi didn’t advance to the top 32 but left the competition with fresh sounds, more precise delivery and the newfound understanding that top performers didn’t just wing it on stage. They prepare “carefully crafted and structured” arrangements and strategically maneuver the microphone throughout their routines to control sounds like whistles, zippers and hums. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After jamming at the competition with some of the icons of the artform, Choi felt like “everything leveled up.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I definitely thought that I was really good before I went to last year’s championships, and then I was very rudely awakened to how large even the American scene was,” he said, and noted his struggles with mic technique the first time around. “But (the competition) was great, it was really eye-opening.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A gap year midway through his Brown career allowed him time to polish the skills he learned from the veterans, and he fully committed to music. He practiced beatboxing daily and switched from studying engineering to pursuing the computer music and multimedia track in the music department. After the brief hiatus, Choi reclaimed his spot in the Jabberwocks and used the group’s performances as opportunities to compose new routines that accompanied the group’s a cappella arrangements. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Smash Sounds, a smaller competition Choi attended in New York this past summer, gave Peach a chance to showcase the fruits of his labor as he survived the initial elimination round and reached the head-to-head battles before falling to the eventual champion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since getting a taste of the beatbox community and its competitive opportunities, Choi hopes to keep battling for as long as he can. But competing wasn’t always the avenue he envisioned for his beatboxing career. Long before Choi had heard of any beatboxing championships, he stumbled across a video of Australian beatboxer Tom Thum doing an unconventional <a href="https://youtu.be/GNZBSZD16cY">TEDx Talk</a>. It features little lecturing but lots of vocal manipulation, and is a popular TEDx Talk clip with 67 million views. A 17-year-old Choi was enthralled. He spent the next few months learning from YouTube videos and practicing the basic “B,” “T” and “Pf” sounds to bolster his high school a cappella group’s performances. Within a month, he could imitate the kick drum, a hi-hat cymbal and a snare drum well enough to keep rhythm for his fellow singers.</span></p>
https://youtu.be/TYZIZZ46xpA
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Choi wasn’t satisfied with merely conquering the basics and went beyond the drum set to shape his own style — one that leans more toward the melodies and harmonies associated with musicality than the speed and complexity of technical beatboxing. It’s that quality which prompted fellow Jabberwock Caymus Price ’20 to call Choi’s creations “Mozart-esque” and resulted in Peach achieving a 14th seed going into the American Beatbox Championship. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Distinct from the qualification process used in previous years, the 2018 American Beatbox Championships required hopefuls to post a video showcasing their skills. Rather than allow every interested beatboxer to show up to the competition for a large elimination round, a panel of judges reviewed the submissions and selected the top 32 beatboxers from 115 applicants. Those chosen to vie for a chance at the title in New York will perform a 90-second routine on the first day of competition to determine the 16 moving on to day two. </span></p>
<p class="p2">After the judges cut the field in half and reseed the competitors based on day-one scores, the beatboxers face off in single-elimination battles where they will be judged on their stage presence and the originality, musicality, technicality and flow of their routines. Each beatboxer gets two 90-second rounds to impress the panel and one-up their opponent with the winner advancing until only two remain in the fight for the national title.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Choi is far more prepared than he was for his previous two competitions, he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He has around nine routines in mind this time around whereas he freestyled his way through the 2017 championship and Smash Sounds<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— but he waves away the notion that he will breeze through his first performance. When Price alerted the crowd at the Jabberwocks concert over Family Weekend to Choi’s national ranking and qualification to the American Beatbox Championships, Peach’s reaction was far from boastful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The first thing he said after the concert was ‘Why did you have to tell everyone that? It’s not that big of a deal,’” Price remembered. “And then he kept trying to downplay it like ‘Not everyone goes to this competition. Some people are just too good. They don’t even apply.’”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s true that a portion of the beatbox community chooses not to compete, but Choi is rising in the ranks of those who do. His place as 14th seed indicates that the judges feel he is in the top half of the field coming into the competition, and if he showcases more of the musicality the experts appreciated in his submission, he has a chance at making the cut. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The artists who engage with Choi’s music on a consistent basis are confident that he has what it takes to separate himself from other competitors as he stands out among past and present Jabberwocks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Musically, he is unlike anybody we have ever had in the group,” former Jabberwock Brendan George ’18 said. “I can say with confidence we have never had a beatboxer like Choi, and certainly not a beatboxer and vocalist like Choi.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Choi credits George for first shortening his full name into “Peachy,” but George “gives Peter a lot of credit because he has now fully embraced it and has made Peach into what you know it to be today.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The beatbox community may not be fully acquainted yet, but it will soon become very familiar with a 21-year-old from New Jersey, an American up-and-comer and a much-improved competitor threatening to shake up national rankings come Nov. 10 in New York. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He’s Peachy to friends, Peach to competitors and 14th-ranked beatboxer in the country to everyone who has yet to be introduced. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The field hockey team traveled to Philadelphia last weekend, falling to Penn 1-0 and defeating Villanova University 3-1. Katie Hammaker ’19 starred in net for the Bears and recorded 14 saves in the loss and 13 in the victory. The win marked the fourth double-digit save game of the season for the senior netminder. With the weekend’s results, the team moves to 7-9 record overall on the season and 1-5 in Ivy League play with one contest remaining. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Hammaker, a senior from Ephrata, Pennsylvania, has had a stellar career as the field hockey team’s goaltender. Since arriving at Brown in 2015, Hammaker has started in net every game that the team has played and received Second Team All-Ivy Honors in 2016. For her outstanding performance against Penn and Villanova this weekend, Hammaker has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the great performance this weekend. How does it feel to get a big win against Villanova on the road and play so well?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hammaker: It’s awesome. Especially being a senior and having my last few games, it was just great to have everybody come together and play as a team to pull out a win. Even though we didn’t win against Penn, we really improved upon our performance against them last year, and it was great to see that kind of growth and unity. A lot of grit and hard work, and I’m just really proud of how the team played this weekend. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><b>With only one game remaining in your college career, you are currently fifth all-time for career saves by a Brown goalkeeper with 346. How does it feel to make such an impact on the team? (Since the interview, Hammaker has moved to third all-time for career saves by a Brown goalkeeper with 462.)</b></p>
<p class="p2">It’s unreal. I didn’t know that until a few weeks ago. It’s just great to be part of the tradition here. It’s been such a huge part of my life and to see how much I’ve grown as a person and a player since I’ve been here has been really special. I’m just so proud to come from a program and a place like this.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>When did you first start playing field hockey?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I first started playing in seventh grade, which is a lot later than most people where I’m from. I’ve always played goalie because I didn’t like running, and I thought I was pretty good so I just stuck with it.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you have any pre-game rituals?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I always pray before games. It just keeps me calm and keeps me centered. Sometimes when my emotions or my energy get too high, then I don’t play as well. So, doing that keeps me grounded and reminds me of what’s important going into the game.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What has been your favorite memory with the field hockey team?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Definitely senior day during my sophomore year. We came back from a two-goal deficit to tie Yale and take them into overtime, and then we won in overtime. That was a really special experience for the seniors that year and we got to help them. Hopefully we can replicate that this weekend, but that was definitely one of my favorite memories.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What do you want to see out of the team in your last game against Yale?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I just want to see hard work for 70 minutes. Yale is a very good team that is not going to give up for those 70 minutes, so I think (playing) unified, (with) no pressure and taking risks will be really important. (It’s) something that I know we can accomplish.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What will you miss most about being on the team?</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’ll miss the people and the friendships that I’ve made. It’s really what it’s all about. Field hockey has given me a lot of confidence and belief in myself, and so I’m excited for what’s to come to take that into the rest of my life. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><b>What are you concentrating in and hope to do after Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I’m concentrating in education studies, focusing on human development. I’m hoping to start teaching in the elementary and special-ed realm. Then, I’d like to move up and become a principal and maybe down the road open my own school or get into education policy.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears will return to the Goldberger Family Field for their final game of the season against Yale Saturday at 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="p2"><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sachan &#039;22: The new NFC East looks much more interesting</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Putting together an NFL team is hard. Teams have to navigate a balancing act, deciding whether they can go for a playoff run this year at the cost of future years’ success. We’ve seen major trades this week as teams have raced to decide if they’re in win-now or rebuild mode. All four NFC East teams recently made acquisitions; this is a game-changer in a division with three teams that suddenly look much more threatening. The Cowboys made the biggest splash by grabbing Amari Cooper, and the Eagles brought in veteran receiver Golden Tate from the Lions. The Redskins traded a fourth-round pick to Green Bay for safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, and the Giants sent cornerback Eli Apple to the Saints for fourth- and seventh-round picks. These trades have confirmed what was already becoming evident midway through the season: It’s clear which NFC East teams think they’ve got what it takes to make a run and which teams are content to wait until next season.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Cowboys made an excellent trade by obtaining Cooper, despite having to sacrifice a first-round pick. It is evident that the Cowboys think they have the weapons they need to make a playoff bid, and though their 3-4 record might not suggest it, they actually do. Dallas currently has the second-best defense in the league by points allowed. They have one of the league’s best running backs in Ezekiel Elliott and a solid offensive line to back him up. The only weak spot is their passing game. The Cowboys are 30th in the league in passing yards per game because they have no one for quarterback Dak Prescott to throw to. Adding Cooper will give the Cowboys a viable number one receiver. Defenses playing the Cowboys need to focus on shutting down the run game because of Elliot, which will make it even easier for Cooper to make big plays downfield.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s an even better deal because the Cowboys likely would have used the first-round pick they gave up to take a wide receiver in the draft, and there are none as good as Amari Cooper available. The Cowboys now have the advantage of a young player — Cooper is only 24 — who has already proven himself in the league. His numbers have dropped recently, most likely due to the dysfunctional Raiders’ offensive system, but Cooper is still far more skilled than any other Cowboys receiver. His talent should elevate the entire Dallas offense.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, the Eagles, second in the division at 4-4, bolstered an elite receiving corps of Nelson Agholor and Alshon Jeffery by acquiring Tate. The established veteran is an underrated receiver and a deep threat. Just as their acquisition of running back Jay Ajayi last season paved the way for their Super Bowl run, Tate may be Philadelphia’s missing piece. Quarterback Carson Wentz has been playing at a high level since he returned, and Tate can fill in for injured receiver Mike Wallace. Tate’s contract expires after this season,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>so the Eagles are essentially renting him for eight months: They’re going all-out because they still see a path to this year’s playoffs. Perhaps the best time to judge these trades will be two weeks from now when the Cowboys face off against the Eagles. In their last matchup, Tate torched the Cowboys for 132 yards and two touchdowns.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Redskins, quietly leading the NFC East with a 5-2 record, added safety Clinton-Dix to an already formidable defense. Adding Clinton-Dix alongside standout D.J. Swearinger should give the Redskins one of the best safety duos in the league. The question for them is whether their offense will be able to sustain the success the Redskins have found in the first eight weeks of the season. Sure, defense wins championships, but the NFL is more pass-heavy than ever with offenses like the Rams and Chiefs leading the league. The Redskins are having a hard time with their passing game, which may haunt them later in the season. But for now, the Redskins’ recipe for success is working, and Clinton-Dix should make the team even better.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Lastly, the 1-7 Giants. Let’s take a second to appreciate Eli Manning. He’s fought for the only job he ever wanted, won two Super Bowl MVPs and been the face of the franchise for a long time. The Giants are struggling. They keep finding ways to lose games, and the only exciting thing about their team is running back Saquon Barkley. People hold quarterbacks accountable for the team’s success, but Manning is not at fault here. He has made mistakes, but he’s playing behind an offensive line that lets anything and everything through. The fact that Manning goes onto the field every week knowing he’s behind an abysmal offensive line takes courage. So what does all of this have to do with the Apple trade? Everything! The Giants made a decision last year when they drafted Barkley. They decided that they had the talent to make a run for the playoffs and felt that they could do that with Manning throwing the ball. Unfortunately, none of that went according to plan: So far, the Giants have surpassed even the most pessimistic predictions in a remarkably bad first half. The Apple trade came 24 hours after a loss to Atlanta, and it was a sign that the Giants have officially entered a rebuilding phase. What this trade should tell us is to take some heat off of Manning. The whole organization needs a revamp.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But the Cowboys, Eagles and Redskins all bet on themselves<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and look better for it. So keep your eyes on the NFC East. It should be a tight three-way race for the playoffs.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s hockey team continued its season on the road this weekend, drawing even with Colgate University 2-2 in overtime Friday and falling to No. 18 Cornell 3-2 Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jake Harris ’22 and Tristan Crozier ’22 paced the Bears’ offense, posting a goal and an assist each over the weekend. Goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 recorded a season-high 33 saves against the Raiders Friday night, before stopping 31 shots against the Big Red Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 2, Colgate 2 (OT)</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday night, Crozier and Justin Jallen ’22 scored in the second period to give the Bears (0-3-1, 0-2-1 ECAC) a lead, but a Colgate goal early in the third stanza sent the teams into overtime.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Raiders (2-4-1, 0-1-1) opened scoring five minutes into the second period when Bobby McMann sent a shot past Nieto from in front of the blue line. But Bruno answered eight minutes later as Crozier redirected a shot from Zach Giuttari ’20 into the net. Giuttari launched the puck from the point toward the Colgate goal, where Crozier tapped it past Raiders netminder Mitch Benson.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears continued to pressure the Raiders’ net throughout the second period, outshooting Colgate 16-13 in the frame. As the period neared its close, Jallen notched a short-handed goal to give Brown a lead with 5.6 seconds remaining. Jallen maneuvered around a Colgate defenseman in front of the net and sent a backhanded shot past a sliding Benson for the unassisted tally.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">McMann recorded his second goal of the night on a power play early in the third period to equalize the game and send Brown into its first overtime contest of the season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The teams exchanged blows in overtime, as Nieto made three key saves and Brown notched a pair of shots on target.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our defensive core has done a great job,” Nieto said. “We have an older, experienced defensive core, so they kind of know the ropes and they’ve done a really good job of keeping the middle of the ice clear for myself and for Luke (Kania ’21) to easily see pucks.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 2, Cornell 3</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day, Harris and Brent Beaudoin ’20 each scored to bring Bruno within one goal of the Big Red (2-2, 2-0), but the Bears were edged in a contest that came down to the final seconds at Lynah Rink.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following a scoreless first period, Cornell took the lead one minute into the second stanza when Matt Nuttle sent a shot from the slot past Nieto. Brown responded swiftly, converting on the power play two minutes later to tie the game. Harris tapped in a shot that a Cornell defenseman batted away with his stick in midair, but the puck was ruled to be over the goal line after video review. Crozier and Tony Stillwell ’21 earned assists on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have a good feel for the power play with both units — we have different looks on each one which help us break down the other team’s penalty kill,” Harris said. “It’s really been clicking the last couple of games. … It was nice to finally get one at Cornell.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cornell added a pair of goals before the period was over to reclaim the lead. But Beaudoin trimmed the deficit for the Bears three minutes into the final stanza, sending a one-timer past Big Red netminder Matthew Galajda off a centering pass from Jallen.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With just over a minute remaining, the Bears pulled Nieto for an extra skater. Bruno pressured the Big Red’s defense and pushed deep into the offensive zone in the waning seconds of the game, but Galajda held off the attack to secure the victory for Cornell.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears killed off all four of their penalties in the contest. The team has demonstrated a strong command of its penalty kill this season, conceding only one power play goal in four games.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When you’re down a man, there’s kind of that extra urgency to make plays, and I think right now we’re doing a good job of protecting the house, the front of the net and really not giving the opponent’s power play much to shoot at,” Nieto said. “Cornell’s got one of the best power plays in the country — we really didn’t give them too much offensively when they were a man up, so I think we’re doing a really good job of limiting the other team’s opportunities.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The penalty kill has been great,” Harris added. “It really shut down the momentum when the other team gets power plays and (has) allowed us to stay in games when we’ve taken too many calls sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the Bears continue their season against Dartmouth and Harvard this weekend, they seek to increase offensive production and maximize scoring opportunities at the net.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When you get shot totals up, it definitely increases your confidence and makes life hectic for the goalie, which is what we want to do,” Harris said. “Just continuing to play our game and continuing to play in straight lines will help us get that total up.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For the most part, we do take shots, it’s just … (that) we have to get better at getting them through because a lot of teams are very good at just blocking pucks,” Beaudoin said. “In terms of just getting pucks through to the net — that’s a big push we’ve got to make, and then on our part, we also have to block more pucks.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno has also benefited from the addition of its freshman class of six, which has added depth to the roster and accounted for five of the team’s goals so far.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s very nice to be able to see guys come in and make an impact right away,” Beaudoin said. “I think our first three points at least were from freshmen, … so (it’s) very good they can produce.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the Bears proceed further into their season, they maintain a positive and industrious approach that emphasizes everyday processes of improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The mindset’s very positive, we believe in each other a lot,” Harris said. “What’s done is done, and we know that. We just want to build on that each day in every practice, and we’re very excited for the upcoming weekend.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears return home to host Dartmouth Friday and Harvard Saturday at Meehan Auditorium.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Down 3-1 in the second period Saturday against Colgate University, it seemed that the women’s hockey team was headed for a third consecutive loss and a 3-3 record after a promising start. But after two upset comeback victories over top-10 nationally ranked teams, goalie Calla Isaac ’20 said the Bears’ season has taken on a completely different outlook.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It definitely will fundamentally change how our team plays, just give us more confidence going into the next few games,” Isaac said. “It is just a game, but that’s the first time in 14 years that we’ve swept those two teams, so it proves that we’re a different team this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those two teams are Colgate, ranked ninth in the country, and Cornell, ranked sixth. The Bears played Colgate Friday and Cornell Saturday and came away with two come-from-behind 4-3 upset wins. Forward Sena Hanson ’20 scored two goals in each game, including both game-winners.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Newly hired Head Coach Carisa Wahlig praised Hanson’s performance. “She’s got an amazing shot, she’s a power forward, a very powerful player and very team-oriented,” Wahlig said. “She’s one of those players that will do whatever it takes.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hanson, Wahlig said, is also taking a leadership role on the team. “We’ve talked with (Hanson) about being an upperclassman and really showing her side of her leadership, which is (that) she’s very vocal on the ice … (and) on the bench,” she said. “From what we’ve seen from her, she’s definitely a player that we can count on in the clutch.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Seven games into the season, the Bears’ 5-2 record is a welcome development, particularly after a 2-27 campaign in 2017-18. Hanson and Isaac offered similar explanations for Bruno’s newfound success: an improved cohesiveness, brought about at least in part by Wahlig and her coaching staff.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wahlig’s leadership, Isaac said, has the team working harder than ever and working together. “She’s definitely brought our team together as a family,” Isaac said. “We’re one unit now, working for each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When Wahlig was hired, her first order of business was reshaping the team’s culture. “Last year, we weren’t really a cohesive unit. We came for hockey, and our team culture was just going through the motions,” Hanson said. “This year, everyone’s holding each other accountable, Coach Wahlig is making sure that we’re all staying positive and supporting each other. It changed so much that we’re even hanging out outside of hockey.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With these off-ice changes, the Bears entered a weekend of games against nationally ranked opponents with a 3-2 record and a culture of cohesiveness and competition. “We knew they were tough teams,” Isaac said. “They’re ranked teams. We were definitely an underdog in this game, but we went in just wanting to fight, to take it to them, to prove who we are. We want people to not take us for granted.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hanson’s goal-scoring powered Bruno’s offense: seven games into the season, she has scored six goals after scoring eight over 29 games in 2017-18. “I’ve worked on the mental side of hockey a lot,” she said. “I’ve been talking to Coach Wahlig a lot about staying focused and staying consistent shift after shift.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Friday, Bruno also notched goals from forwards Tina Paolillo ’22 and Lizzy Gross ’22. On Saturday, in addition to Hanson’s two goals, Veronica Alois ’20 and Abby Nearis ’21 both scored.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Isaac, meanwhile, anchored the Bears’ defense. “(Isaac) played out of her mind,” Hanson said. “She was making some big saves the whole game.” In both upset wins, Isaac posted scoreless third periods.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“She’s a competitor,” Wahlig said. “She wants to compete, and she can be relied on in the clutch. That’s huge to have a goalie like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Entering the second period against Colgate, Bruno trailed 3-1. “In the dressing room, we were all just like, ‘we don’t want to lose, we want to win,’” Isaac said. “We all just banded together.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hanson credited the coaching staff for the turnaround. “We were in the locker room, and our coaches come in, and they say, it only takes one or two shots to tie it up. Lucky bounce here or there…” she said. “It really just sparked something in us, and we started to work hard.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though both games ended in Brown wins, only time will tell whether the weekend was a fluke or the start of a winning era for Brown women’s hockey. There are some indications that it may not be: In the weekend wins, the Bears were outshot 41-25 against Colgate and 41-20 against Cornell.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“That’s definitely something we need to work on,” Isaac said. “It’s always a goal to outshoot the other team. We need to get more shots on net.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Wahlig said that being outshot was not entirely unexpected, nor was it necessarily a bad thing. The Bears made adjustments to their defensive system to adapt to the faster forwards of a nationally ranked offense, she said. These adjustments meant that the opposition would almost certainly take more shots. “We wanted to limit the number of quality shots that the other teams took,” Wahlig said. “So I didn’t care if we got out-shot, as long as the quality of their shots (wasn’t) very good. Yes, we didn’t have as many shots, but we got more quality shots.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even after beating two top-10 nationally ranked teams, the Bears need to continue working hard every weekend, Wahlig said. “It’s great, we got two great wins, but those two great wins don’t guarantee success the next weekend. You have to show up and be ready to go every game,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While these two wins were just two of 29 games on the schedule, “for the girls, it shows them that if they really put the work in and are disciplined, that they can compete,” Wahlig said. “That’s something that they needed to see early on.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will return to the ice Friday against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (2-5), and when they do, they will return not as the 2-27 team of 2017-18, but rather as the team whose most recent games were back-to-back wins against top-10 nationally ranked opponents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve been working so hard, we’ve put in so much work in the offseason,” Hanson said. “It makes us realize that we can compete with all the teams in the conference. …This really gives us hope that our hard work is actually paying off.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Same story, new game: Bears fall again</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Over a century of classic college football has been played in the historic Yale Bowl, but amid swirling wind gusts Saturday, the Bears looked listless in a loss to the Bulldogs. While the weather was certainly a factor in the contest, it seemed to always push Yale forward and hold Bruno back. The Elis jumped out to an early lead and never looked back, dominating in a blowout victory that saw the Brown offense record negative 27 yards rushing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On Brown’s first offensive possession, plays seemed to be clicking between quarterback Michael McGovern ’21 and his receivers. The sophomore signal-caller found LJ Harriott ’20 on two drag routes to bring the Bears (1-7, 0-5 Ivy) to midfield. But just as Bruno got into rhythm, the wind carried McGovern’s pass over Harriott’s head into the diving arms of Yale defensive back Rodney Thomas for an interception.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We try not to worry about anything that we can’t control, and the weather — or in today’s case the wind — is one of those things,” McGovern wrote in a statement to The Herald. “No matter what the conditions are, we just need to go out and execute our jobs.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At first glance, this game should have been a tough one for Yale (5-3, 3-2), as the team gave its freshman quarterback Griffin O’Connor the first start of his college career. But O’Connor went on to pass for 436 yards and four touchdowns, and led the Bulldogs down the field for a touchdown on his first drive.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On Bruno’s next possession, McGovern was able to march his team into Yale territory, but sacks and penalties gave Brown a 4th and 19 on the Yale 33-yard line. With the wind, the Bears elected not to attempt a 50-yard field goal, but came five yards short of the first down on a pass to Jakob Prall ’20 for a turnover on downs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A “common theme on our team right now is finish — finishing plays, finishing drives (and) finishing tackles,” wrote defensive captain Michael Hoecht ’20 in a statement to The Herald. “We need to focus on putting ourselves in great situations and getting ourselves off the field on third down.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yale was again able to capitalize on Brown’s offensive errors. Moments later, O’Connor found wide receiver JP Shohfi in the endzone, who did his best Odell Beckham Jr. impression when he made an athletic one-handed catch while falling on his back. With the touchdown, the Bears found themselves in a 14-point hole by the end of the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the second, Yale scored another passing touchdown to Shohfi, while the Bears had drive after drive stalled due to untimely sacks. With seven minutes left in the half, McGovern found receiver Erik Kromer ’20 for an 18-yard gain, and Brown finally finished a drive with points when Dylan Brady ’22 knocked in a 32-yard field goal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At halftime, Yale led Brown 20-3 and had outgained Bruno by 143 yards.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The second half followed a similar pattern to the first, as Yale continued to find the endzone while the Bears struggled to sustain a drive.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The only reprieve for the Bears came when McGovern found Scott Boylan ’21 for a 53-yard touchdown strike to bring Bruno within 18 points of the Elis.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bulldogs managed to score in several different ways. O’Connor found Reed Klubnik for a 60-yard touchdown in the third quarter on a one-play drive, and led Yale down the field for a long, ten-play series for a touchdown in the fourth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Long after the game had descended into a rout, the Bears were able to piece together a successful drive late in the fourth quarter. The series was finished off by a two-yard touchdown run from Boylan, which brought the score to 46-16.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Going forward, we have to remain healthy and play with heart,” Hoecht wrote. “It’s our seniors’ last time wearing their home jerseys (next week) and … we will be playing for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When the final whistle sounded, the Bears had suffered their fourth game of season of giving up more than 40 points, and their seventh game of being unable to score 20. Brown averaged negative 1.6 yards per rushing attempt and gained a total of 331 yards, while the Bulldogs exploded for nearly 600 yards of offense. McGovern finished the game 25-47 with 358 yards, one touchdown and a pick.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We just need to focus on ourselves, get better everyday and fight till the end in every practice, play and game,” McGovern wrote. “We’re (going to) come out next week and give everything we have looking for the win against Columbia. As long as we do our jobs, I have full faith in our team and our coaches.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This loss marks Bruno’s 13th straight defeat in the Ivy League, leaving Brown and its fans praying that 13 is the Bears’ lucky number and that the losing streak can come to an end next week. The team will return to Brown Stadium Saturday for its final home game of the season against Columbia at noon.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The University received a $3 million gift from David Given ’75 to fund the Jeanette and Richard Given Men’s Ice Hockey Head Coaching Position last month. This is the largest coaching gift ever made to the University, wrote Director of Athletics and Recreation Jack Hayes in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We are grateful to David Given for his leadership and generosity,” Hayes wrote. “His gift will significantly impact the men’s ice hockey program and assist us in our effort to reach the top of (Eastern College Athletic Conference) Hockey.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given hopes that the endowment will “continue to support the (coaching position) in the ways that it needs to be supported” and assist the University in renovating Meehan Auditorium, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prior to donating the money, Given said he spoke with the athletic department to see “what we can try to do to re-elevate the program.” They concluded that a “fair amount of capital needs to be raised to renovate Meehan,” which opened in 1961 and underwent its last major renovation in 2002, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Meehan has to be upgraded to continue to attract the kinds of student-athletes to have a high-performing program,” he added. Following conversation with the University, Given decided to endow the coaching position and “free up funds for future renovations to Meehan.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given played for the University’s hockey team from 1973 to 1975. In 1976, the year after he graduated, the team made the Frozen Four, the NCAA hockey semi-finals. Given hopes the endowment will allow the program to experience the level of success it achieved in the mid-’70s and positively impact the experiences of the University students who play hockey, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I had an unbelievable four-year experience to advance my capabilities in h</span><span class="s2">ockey while I was getting a ridiculously good education,” Given said. “That’s what I’m so grateful for and that’s why I did what I did.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">While they may not experience the impacts of the endowment first-hand, Max Gottlieb ’19 and Tommy Marchin ’19, co-captains of the men’s ice hockey team, said they are grateful for Given’s generosity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“I can’t thank Mr. Given enough for getting the ball rolling in what I hope is an even larger commit</span><span class="s1">ment to our program from the school and donors alike,” Gottlieb said. “It’s a testament to some of the great experiences that Mr. Given has had here as a player and student that led him to make such a generous donation to the program.” </span></p>
<p class="p2">Given’s endowment arrives as part of the University’s BrownTogether Campaign, a $3 billion fundraising effort that began in 2015, Th<span class="s1">e Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/10/23/brown-launches-3-billion-comprehensive-campaign/">previously reported</a>. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The women’s basketball team outlasted the Central Connecticut State University Blue Devils in a physical battle at home Tuesday night, with 28 forced turnovers powering the Bears to the win in their season opener. Although Bruno shot just 21-64 from the field and 2-19 from beyond the arc, their persistent press on defense enabled them to triumph in the back-and-forth affair. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown earned a 12-1 record last season in non-conference play, and looked to get off to a similar hot start with a victory Tuesday. The Bears (1-0) started slowly, allowing the Blue Devils (0-1) to jump out to a six-point halftime lead, but they responded after the break and stormed back to beat CCSU 68-63. Guard Shayna Mehta ’19, who earned a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds, was crucial to the Bears’ effort, as were guards Taylor Will ’19, who picked up seven steals, and Justine Gaziano ’20, who led Bruno with 27 points.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">CCSU jumped out to an 8-4 advantage thanks in part to two layups by center Ashley Berube. The Bears answered with a 10-0 run, capped by two smooth jumpers by Mehta. A score by CCSU guard Emma McCamus boosted the Blue Devils, but Brown still held a 14-10 advantage after the first quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Blue Devils went on the offensive the second quarter, with guard Kiana Patterson leading the charge. Gaziano struck first in the</span><span class="s2"> period with a layup, but Patterson followed by nailing the first three-pointer of the game for either team. Later, after two consecutive scores by Patterson, CCSU guard Sydney Hines hit another three to give the Blue Devils a 26-22 lead. Gaziano’s consistent scoring kept the Bears in the game, but inaccuracy from the rest of the off</span><span class="s1">ense caused Brown to go into halftime down 33-27.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears made defensive adjustments at halftime that enabled a second-half surge, according to head coach Sarah Behn. “We started mixing up the defense with pressure on and off. That allowed us to get some layups and take the lead,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By forcing 12 turnovers in the third quarter and committing just three, the Bears generated plenty of scoring opportunities for their offense. Bruno chipped away at the Blue Devils’ lead and headed to a media timeout down 39-37 with 4:34 left in the quarter. A three-pointer out of the timeout by Gaziano gave the Bears the lead, swinging momentum Brown’s way. The Bears added several more scores off CCSU turnovers, including a steal by forward Mary Butler ’19 that she turned into a layup, giving Bruno a 47-43 lead heading into the final quarter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">CCSU edged right back into contention after the Brown run. A Berube jumper and a Patterson three helped the Blue Devils tie the game at 48, and soon after another three by Patterson put them ahead 55-53. But Mehta led a 9-0 run for the Bears, which included a hard-fought rebound that clinched her double-double. The run allowed Bruno to pull away, and efficient play at the end of the game sealed the 68-63 win.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears were able to win the game despite shooting 32.8 percent from the field, 10.5 percent from three, and 63.2 percent from the free throw line. Both Behn and Gaziano agreed that the poor shooting night offered room for improvement. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We didn’t have a good shooting percentage from any area,” Behn said. “We have to and will improve that immediately. Normally we shoot the ball well.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We all need to get in the gym and get some shots up,” Gaziano concurred.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Forward Erika Steeves ’19 viewed the Bears’ ability to grind out the win despite offensive struggles as a positive. “The fact that we can shoot 10 percent from three and still win is a good sign,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will look to continue their strong start tonight at Bryant University (1-0), who defeated the University of Massachusetts Lowell 58-57 in their season opener Tuesday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Duke hoops seem above any competition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">College basketball returned earlier this week. For teams hoping to win a national championship though, the season might as well be over already. The Duke Blue Devils are so far ahead of everyone else, it looks like they’re playing a different sport. Coach Mike Krzyzewski has perfected the one-and-done system, gathering the greatest collection of talent that we’ve seen in this era of college hoops. The Blue Devils came into this season only ranked fourth in the country for some unimaginable reason, but they put all doubts to rest on Tuesday night, defeating second-ranked Kentucky by 34 points. The so-called second best team in the country couldn’t compete with Duke for more than six minutes of gameplay. So how exactly does this happen?</p>
<p class="p3">Having the consensus number one NBA prospect on the roster helps. R.J. Barrett lived up to all the hype on Tuesday, scoring 33 points on 13 of 26 shooting, adding an additional six assists and four rebounds. Barrett can score with ease at the college level. He’s long — 6’ 7” with a 6’ 10” wingspan — and crafty with his dribble, using long strides to get to the basket. Barrett’s shot isn’t the prettiest in the world, but the ball does go in; he shot three of seven from the perimeter against Kentucky. There’s a natural comparison to make with James Harden here, especially considering that both are lefties — at worst Barrett is a future top-25 NBA player.</p>
<p class="p3">Another thing that helps with fielding a championship college basketball team? Having the consensus number two NBA prospect as well. Zion Williamson is famous for his jaw-dropping dunking skills, but he is much more of a complete player than many predicted coming into the season. Williamson, and not Barrett, looked like the best player on the floor against Kentucky, with a mix of size, strength, speed and explosiveness we’ve rarely seen in basketball. The freshman scored 28 points on 11 of 13 shooting with seven rebounds, but his statistics (as incredible as they are) don’t convey what a force he truly is — Williamson jumped higher than anyone else while standing at 6’ 7” and 285 pounds. He’s Charles Barkley 2.0, a larger version of Draymond Green who can leap out of the gym. The rest of the country has no hope of defending him, since Williamson can jump over and push through any college player.</p>
<p class="p3">Add another top-five NBA prospect to those two: Cam Reddish. This freshman has been a little left behind in all the buzz between Barrett and Williamson. But Reddish can take over the scoring load for Duke whenever it is necessary. He added 22 points to the Blue Devils’ onslaught on Tuesday, and sparkled defensively with four steals. Reddish is long, 6’ 7” with a 7’ 1” wingspan, and has the potential to become an elite defensive player. He’s perfect for the modern NBA: A true two-way player with mobility up and down the floor. Reddish is widely projected to go third or fourth in the 2019 NBA draft. The first three players chosen might all be Blue Devils.</p>
<p class="p3">To make matters worse for other teams, Duke has plenty of depth after its Big Three. Tre Jones, brother of Duke hero and NBA guard Tyus Jones, is another freshman who will have a starting role. A point guard, Jones won’t have to do too much and overextend his game (at times a problem for him in the past) thanks to his talented teammates. He can focus on playing a distributor role, and got off to a good start in his first game with seven assists. If Jones can get more shots to fall — he went 2 of 7 against Kentucky — then he’s the perfect role player to balance out Duke’s star power.</p>
<p class="p3">There are veterans on this team who can step up and fill in when needed. Center Marques Bolden, another guy with size, should provide some extra rim protection and shot blocking. The junior will see significantly more playing time than he did during his sophomore season, when he averaged 12.9 minutes per game. Sophomore Alex O’Connell impressed in spurts last year. He’s a three-point shooter extraordinaire, making 48.9 percent of his long-range shots his first year in Durham. O’Connell has a great opportunity to have a big season, moving without the ball and getting tons of open looks thanks to all the defensive attention focused on Barrett, Williamson and Reddish.</p>
<p class="p3">To put it simply, Duke is the perfect college basketball team. The Blue Devils have top-tier talent no one else can match: The number one NBA prospect, the number two NBA prospect and potentially the number three NBA prospect. With all due respect to Udoka Azubuike and Kansas, or Rui Hachimura and Gonzaga, Duke has the best players of any contending team, no doubt about it. But to make things even easier come March, Coach K can also fall back on role players who fit in seamlessly with this roster. Enjoy the run, because few teams in the future will be able to match up to what we’re watching right now.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Abby Carchio ’20 scored one goal and notched two assists in the women’s soccer team’s 3-0 win over Yale last Sunday. Those four points on Senior Day raised her season total to 28 and helped her lead the Ivy League in scoring. A native of nearby Lakeville, Massachusetts, Carchio was awarded her second consecutive set of First Team All-Ivy honors Wednesday. For her impressive performance in the victory over Yale and her stellar season, Carchio has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Herald: You scored four points on Sunday with a goal and two assists. How did it feel to contribute so much to the win?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Carchio: I was just thinking about the seniors, honestly. That’s what I wanted to do, was just let them have a good final game.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>You finished the season scoring 28 points, the most of anyone in the Ivy League. What was it like to be able to produce that much?</b></p>
<p class="p3">It felt pretty good. I just have to give credit to my teammates for setting me up. … It was a result of having some of our forwards injured in the beginning of the season, and I (kind of) had to step up into that role.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>You wear very distinctive bright green cleats. Is there anything behind that?</b></p>
<p class="p3">It helps me when I’m watching film ­— it’s easier for me to pick out which player I am. And so when my grandparents, aunts and uncles watch the games, they know who I am on the field.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Sunday was the team’s Senior Day (when players celebrate teammates who are about to graduate). Did that influence the way you and your team prepared for the game?</b></p>
<p class="p3">We definitely went into the game playing with a lot more heart. You kind of brush everything off. Other games you play with the head, you think more about the opponent. That day was just about our team and playing for the seniors.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>The team managed a shutout in goalkeeper Christine Etzel’s ’19 final game. Did the team do anything differently defensively to try and keep the clean sheet?</b></p>
<p class="p3">We definitely locked down the back in the last 20 minutes when we went up three nil. That was on everyone’s mind because Christine’s history and stats were relying on that shutout so we wanted to preserve that for her.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>You were named a First Team All-Ivy selection for the second year in a row. What does that award mean to you?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I really try not to focus on the awards and stuff like that. Obviously, it feels good superficially, but ultimately to me it matters where we finish in the table. This season was slightly disappointing for us, so it’s back to the drawing board for next season.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Going into your senior year next fall, what do you want the team to accomplish?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I want a ring. A championship ring is what I want. I think we have a great group of returners — we were a young team this year. That should be helpful to have experienced players.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following a five-game winless skid, Saturday’s contest felt different for the football team. In a game where 17 seniors made their final appearance at Brown Stadium, Bruno looked ready to deliver the best gift possible to its graduating class: a win. But try as they might, the Bears have simply not performed to their potential this season, and a second-half collapse precipitated another blowout loss, this time against Columbia. With the defeat, the Bears clinched last place in the Ivy League standings for the second year in a row. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a tale of two halves,” said Head Coach Phil Estes. “First half, we made big plays. Second half, we failed to make plays. When we learn to play 60 minutes, we’ll have a chance.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears (1-8, 0-6 Ivy) came out of the locker room with energy and seized momentum early. In the first quarter, Columbia (5-4, 2-4), led by quarterback Ty Lenhart and wide receiver Kyle Castner, embarked on a long, eight-minute drive deep into Brown territory. But on 4th and 2 on the Bears’ 24-yard line, Brown’s defense forced an incompletion to stop the promising series. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just two plays later, quarterback Michael McGovern ’21 threw to wide receiver Scott Boylan ’21 on a quick swing pass on the right side of the field. Boylan found the edge and sprinted downfield, speeding past Columbia defenders and tiptoeing the sideline on his way to a 76-yard touchdown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“First half, we had a lot of big plays,” Boylan said. “I think we got complacent.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Bruno’s next possession, the offense faced 2nd and 10 on its 48-yard line. McGovern took the shotgun snap and fumbled the ball, but quickly scooped it up and launched a deep rocket to wide receiver LJ Harriott ’20. Harriott had snuck behind the Lions’ secondary and was wide open downfield for the 52-yard touchdown strike. By the end of the first quarter, the Bears led 14-0. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Brown’s scoring barrage and stiff defense would not last, as the Lions drove methodically down the field for two touchdowns in the second quarter. In the span of just five minutes, Columbia had tied the score at 14 with eight minutes left in the half. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So when the Bears’ offense took the field on their own 10-yard line after blowing an early lead, hope was not abundant in the stands of Brown Stadium. But Estes dug into his bag of tricks, and the team ran a reverse handoff to wide receiver Jakob Prall ’20 who accelerated into the secondary. Though Columbia’s defenders had the angle, Prall zoomed past everyone en route to a 90-yard score to send the Brown sideline into a frenzy and put the Bears up 20-14. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the Lions missed a 37-yard field goal before halftime, the Bears seemed to be in firm control of the game with a six-point lead. But the signs of a second-half collapse were already present. While the Bears had earned a lead, they had done so with big, chunk plays, as seen by the fact that the team only had five catches and averaged 29.6 yards per reception. Despite facing a halftime deficit, the Lions led in first downs 13-3 and yards 261-228. So when the big plays stopped materializing for the Bears and the Lions continued to play consistently on offense, the rout was on. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the Lions’ first drive of the half, they marched down the field in just a minute and a half to score a touchdown and take the lead. Columbia got the ball back after a quick three-and-out from the Bears, and again cut through the Brown defense like a hot knife through butter. On a trick play that saw the Lions use a lateral behind the line of scrimmage, Ryan Young got the ball and weaved through the Brown defense for a 25-yard score. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite giving away the halftime lead, the Bears still had life and only trailed by eight points. On back-to-back Columbia possessions at the end of the third quarter and start of the fourth, Bruno’s defense earned big fourth down stops to seemingly shift momentum back to the home team. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the offense was wildly ineffective, only gaining 26 yards in the entire half. McGovern was constantly under pressure and was forced to focus on escaping Columbia’s defensive linemen rather than throwing the ball downfield. The Lions’ defense earned 10 sacks throughout the game to push the Bears back 61 yards. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With eight minutes left in the contest, Brown’s defense finally broke. On 4th and 1 at the Bears’ 31-yard line, Castner went untouched on a long touchdown gallop that put Columbia up double-digits and buried the Bears. The touchdown would be Castner’s fifth of the game, as he was credited with passing for two and rushing for three. Just a few minutes later, the Lions would reach the endzone again to bring the score to 42-20.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Senior quarterback Nicholas Duncan ’19 relieved McGovern in the last few minutes, but the offense did not fare any better.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Next week, we just need to get up early like we did this week,” Boylan said. “(We need to) continue to play hard, keep up with those big plays and keep scoring touchdowns.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the final whistle sounded, the Bears’ early successes and touchdowns felt as if they had happened seasons ago. The Lions led in first downs 24-6 and total yards 515-254. McGovern passed 7-18 on the day for 164 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. The Brown defense recorded zero sacks and zero turnovers, giving up more than 40 points for the fifth time this season. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s truly bittersweet,” said cornerback Jorquel Condomina ’19. “We would have liked to have come out on top obviously, but it has been a pleasure to be here. I love the program, and Brown changed my life.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since standardized Ivy League football began in 1956, Bruno has never gone 0-7 in the Ivy League for two consecutive years. The Bears will take to the field for their final game of the season away against Dartmouth Saturday at 1:30 p.m. and are at risk of making history.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following visits to Colgate University and Cornell last week, the men’s hockey team returned home to claim its first victory of the season, prevailing over Ivy rival Dartmouth 4-2 at Meehan Auditorium Friday. The win highlighted a pair of mixed results after the Bears fell to Harvard 5-2 Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Persistent offense and a 31-save performance from goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 powered Bruno to victory over the Big Green. The Bears have now denied Dartmouth at home for two consecutive seasons, as this weekend’s win follows a 3-0 shutout of the Green on home ice in the team’s 2017-18 campaign.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 4, Dartmouth 2</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Friday night, goals from four different Bears fueled the team to its first victory of the season. Brady Schoo ’19, Chris Berger ’21, Zach Giuttari ’20 and Max Gottlieb ’19 each scored to secure a lead over the Big Green (3-2, 3-2 ECAC).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brown (1-4-1, 1-3-1) took control of possession and pressured the Dartmouth net from the drop of the puck, outshooting the Big Green 11-5 in the first period. Schoo opened scoring midway through the stanza, collecting a feed from Alex Brink ’19 at the point and launching a smooth shot past netminder Adrian Clark. Joe Maguire ’20 picked up an assist on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We were possessing pucks pretty well,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “We weren’t hesitating to actually shoot the puck, and … we created some really good chances. I thought we played fast, I thought we played with pace (and) I thought we competed hard.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Berger put away a rebound to widen the Bears’ lead two and a half minutes into the second period. Tommy Marchin ’19 took the initial shot, which Clark deflected toward the slot where Berger was waiting to snap the puck into the net.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dartmouth answered back one minute later as Will Graber capitalized on a turnover to give the Big Green its first goal of the evening. The Green became more aggressive in the zone, but Bruno’s solid defense, highlighted by several athletic saves from Nieto, staved off the attack to preserve the advantage entering the final stanza.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Giuttari extended the lead midway through the third period, gathering a pass from Tony Stillwell ’21 and launching a powerful shot past Clark from the blue line. Quin Foreman scored for Dartmouth six minutes later to keep Brown on its heels, but Gottlieb notched an empty net goal in the penultimate minute to secure the victory for the Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the crease, Nieto’s 31-save performance marked his third consecutive game with over 30 stops. The Bears’ penalty kill went 6-for-6 in the contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We just outworked them,” Giuttari said. “We started out really well — we got in on the forecheck right away, they couldn’t break the puck out, our (defensemen) were jumping down and their forwards couldn’t do anything. … We definitely had a focus on getting more shots because we only had 20 or 25 shots in the last couple of games, and that’s just not enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 2, Harvard 5</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following night, Tristan Crozier ’22 and Marchin scored as the Bears claimed an early lead over their Ivy rival, but Bruno was unable to sustain momentum against a solid Harvard offense in the second and third periods.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We came out at the beginning in the first period and played really well, and I think we just kind of tiptoed into the second period instead of pushing the pace and making them play to us,” Marchin said. “We just need to carry out that first-period energy throughout the whole game.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears’ first tally of the evening came on a power play late in the first stanza. With two minutes remaining in the frame, Crozier collected a pass from Stillwell at the top of the right circle and fired a shot past Crimson goaltender Michael Lackey to give Brown an early edge. Jake Harris ’22 also recorded an assist on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Harvard (1-2-2, 1-2-2) answered with a trio of goals in the second period to reclaim the lead. After Jack Donato tied the game two and a half minutes into the stanza, Bruno successfully killed off a 5-on-3, but conceded two goals — including one to the Crimson’s power play — late in the frame, entering the third at a deficit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jack Badini added a power play goal for Harvard eight and a half minutes into the final stanza, though Brown responded two minutes later when Marchin launched a shot past Lackey from the left circle.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears pulled Nieto for an extra skater on the power play with two minutes remaining, but Adam Fox cemented the victory for the Crimson with an empty net goal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the Bears’ penalty kill unit has been successful this season, leading the ECAC with a success rate of 88.9 percent entering the weekend, Whittet emphasized the importance of avoiding unnecessary penalties in future competition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We can’t be short for the amount of time that we’ve been short for,” Whittet said. “We have a great penalty kill this year — we have good individuals, and we have good systems, but again, like anything, the more time you give a team time on the power play, they’re going to score.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the penalty kill, “instead of worrying too much about what we’re doing, we’re just working harder, getting on pucks faster and making the other team make mistakes faster,” Marchin added. “It’s been successful so far, but we’d love to not be on the penalty kill as much as we have been.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears have a quick turnaround with a visit to the University of Connecticut for a non-conference contest Tuesday, before resuming ECAC play at Clarkson University and St. Lawrence University after the Thanksgiving break. Looking ahead, Bruno seeks to sustain a productive work ethic and carry momentum forward from its successes, both within the 60 minutes and in the longer term.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Building off of a good period — building and continuing to take steps toward winning the game and playing confidently” is important for the team, Marchin said. “Instead of letting the other team make decisions and (playing) to what they’re doing, if we just keep pushing the pace and make them react to us, we’ll be good in the long run.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg. Seven cities with little in common except their country, the presence of an NHL team and no recent Stanley Cup success. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s now been 25 years since one of Canada’s seven NHL teams took home a Stanley Cup. No team north of the border has even made the Finals since Vancouver lost to Boston in 2011, and three seasons ago, no Canadian team played past the regular season. That said, the tide appears to be finally turning up north, and Canada looks ready to be a force for years to come.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Eastern Conference, both Toronto and Montreal are sitting in playoff spots. Of the two, the Maple Leafs look more likely to break their more-than-50-year championship drought. Still, the fact that both Canadian Original Six teams are relevant in their division as we approach the quarter mark of the season is significant.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the West, all four teams are jockeying for playoff spots. Winnipeg looks like a serious contender to reach the Western Conference Finals for a second straight year. Farther west, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver are starting to see results at long last from their respective rebuilds. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s still early, but at the time of writing, every Canadian team other than Ottawa is at least tied for a playoff spot. But beyond this early success, which looks tenuous in Vancouver and Montreal, the current state of these teams has set Canada up to succeed not just this year, but for the better part of the next decade.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Toronto may have the advantage of luring big names like John Tavares in free agency, but in the less glamorous Canadian cities, slow, methodical rebuilds are starting to turn their teams competitive. Winnipeg is seeing the success of its rebuilt core now, and only a few losses to the Golden Knights kept them out of last year’s Stanley Cup Final. Both teams are already legitimate contenders with key pieces under team control and looking to pace their respective conferences this year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, several years of losing in Alberta and British Columbia are finally paying dividends. Edmonton has built a core around perennial Hart Trophy candidate Connor McDavid that can compete with the Pacific Division heavyweights further south. Calgary is still working out the kinks of its own rebuild, but the pieces seem to be falling into place. In Vancouver, the team’s surprising early season success is being met with skepticism that their own rebuild is not as far ahead of schedule as it seems. But even if this year’s team fades, the Canucks are not far from being competitive as their deep prospect pool continues to mature.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Similar to Vancouver, the Canadiens are experiencing unexpected wins this year but may not be able to sustain them as the season grinds on. But if either team can keep winning, Canada will be well-represented in the playoffs for the first time in a long time. Beyond Toronto and Winnipeg, at least two and as many as four other teams could still be standing after 82 games, a far cry from the country being shut out of the playoffs entirely. While the Senators still look destined to be on the outside looking in come May, trades made with the future in mind have Ottawa only a few years behind their countrymen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This year might not be the year for Canada to finally shake off the long, harsh winter its hockey teams have been weathering for two and a half decades, but don’t count out the possibility. Even if this isn’t the year for a Canadian Cup, the window is open for one, and it isn’t closing anytime soon. For the foreseeable future, Canada is a force to be reckoned with in the NHL.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Sports fans have been looking forward to this MLB offseason for a long time. With a variety of superstars and major contributors available on the free-agent market, the next few months could dictate which future powerhouses emerge as contenders in the 2020s. A lot is at stake, and rumors continue to circulate about possible landing places for the biggest names. The following are my predictions for where the most important free agents will wind up playing next year.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Bryce Harper</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The outfielder went through some struggles last season. He had trouble dealing with aggressive shifting that made him adjust his approach at the plate. Harper finished with a .249 batting average, 34 home runs, 100 runs batted in and an .889 on-base plus slugging percentage. Those numbers fall far short of those from his magical 2015 MVP campaign. On the positive side, however, he proved that he can play a full season of games and rallied in the second-half of the season with a .300 BA and .972 OPS. Harper is still only 26 years old, and though these hitting issues slightly dulled the enthusiasm surrounding his free agency, the outfielder is in position to receive the largest MLB contract ever. It’s hard to match Harper’s potential for greatness, and the team that signs him will get to enjoy his prime seasons. The usual suspects have already been named as possible bidders — the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees and Chicago Cubs. But I look at the Philadelphia Phillies as the ideal spot for Harper: an up-and-coming team that just needs one last impact bat in the lineup to contend. Harper can be the face of the franchise, stay in the familiar National League East and play in the postseason for several years. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Prediction: Phillies, 13 years, $350 million</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Manny Machado</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Another 26-year-old, Machado enjoyed the finest hitting year of his career in 2018 with a .297 BA, 37 HR, 107 RBI and .905 OPS. But a lot of that good feeling was marred by some perplexing actions in the postseason. He stepped on the ankles of first basemen, didn’t hustle in the World Series and often came up short in clutch situations. Machado became baseball’s villain, and some analysts speculated that teams might be less willing to offer him great sums of cash after what occurred in October. Not likely. Machado is just entering his prime, can play shortstop and third base (though he’s much better at the latter) and has proven himself as a consistent power bat. Many of the teams in contention for Harper will try their luck with Machado too. I see him ending up with the New York Yankees. Shortstop Didi Gregorius will be out with Tommy John surgery, so Machado can fill that hole. Once Gregorius returns, Machado can take over on third base, moving defensively-challenged Miguel Andújar to a more suitable corner outfield or first base spot. And let’s face it, Machado is the perfect unpopular addition for the Evil Empire.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Prediction: Yankees, 13 years, $325 million</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Craig Kimbrel</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The closer is lucky to have escaped the 2018 postseason. Kimbrel flirted with danger every time he was on the mound, making Boston Red Sox fans as nervous as possible on the way to a World Series championship. Sometimes Kimbrel had no idea where the ball was going once it left his hand, throwing all over the place and walking batter after batter. On other occasions, he was simply hit hard by the opposition. It took sparkling defensive plays by Red Sox outfielders throughout the postseason to keep the damage to a minimum. If a couple of pitches had been hit slightly harder, Kimbrel could very well be considered a playoff goat. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Postseason aside, Kimbrel has been a dominant reliever for a long time and will command a sizable contract as a result. The 30-year-old has a career 1.91 earned run average, 0.92 walks plus hits per inning pitched and a 14.7 strikeouts per nine innings ratio. Nevertheless, there were signs of slippage all last season — not only during the playoffs. Kimbrel’s 13.9 K/9 mark was his worst since 2015, and his 4.5 walks per nine innings were the second-worst for a full season in his career. I would not chase after Kimbrel aggressively. A team will be paying for the early thirties of a guy who wasn’t at his best all last year and at his lowest when it mattered most. But franchises will go after the All-Star closer of a championship team regardless. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I think the Red Sox will re-sign him in the end. Manager Alex Cora showed great faith in the closer, keeping him on the mound in pressure moments. Boston trusts Kimbrel more than any other team does and wants to keep their winning group together. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Prediction: Red Sox, five years, $80 million</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">And here’s where I see other free agents playing:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Patrick Corbin: Yankees, five years, $120 million</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Dallas Keuchel: Braves, four years, $75 million</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Nathan Eovaldi: Angels, three years, $50 million</span></p>
<p class="p3">Josh Donaldson: Angels, one year, $15 million</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An international student at Brown once asked me why Americans celebrate Thanksgiving. My first instinct was to mention the pilgrims, but that’s not why most of us celebrate the holiday. At least, not anymore. Today, we treat Thanksgiving as a sort of pause button in the hectic cycle of life. Right before finals, we take a week for ourselves. We recharge and spend time with friends and family. On Thanksgiving, we ignore our stresses, rivalries and personal ambitions to come together and be thankful for what we have. So what does football have to do with anything I just said? Thanksgiving football transcends all of the noise society throws at us and gives us an opportunity to come together as a community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like the real world, the NFL is messy. Constant media coverage of football, from press conferences and post-game interviews to President Trump’s tweets, means the NFL is never out of the news. Cultural tensions bleed into the game, manifested visibly in players kneeling during the national anthem. There’s a lot going on, and it’s easy for the casual onlooker to get so lost in the drama that they forget about the games themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But at its core, the NFL offers us an opportunity to take a break from the exhausting chaos of the news cycle ­— encouraging unity and a collective sense of pride. It isn’t the massive stadiums or multi-million dollar paychecks. It isn’t the Super Bowl halftime show or the articles people write about the Super Bowl halftime show the day after. It’s about world-class athletes who come together to play a sport they love. Each of them gives a voice to their team and their city in a way that’s difficult to understand for non-sports enthusiasts. Fans wait their whole lives with unwavering loyalty for their team to make the Super Bowl. The narrative of a sports team often changes the narrative of a city; winning is a validation and celebration of its identity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Thanksgiving approaches, I compel you to turn on the TV. Sure, there’s a lot of noise in the form of commercials and controversies that separate you from the game. But look beyond all of that. Look at the wall of screaming fans that Seattle calls its 12th man. Look at the murals all over Philadelphia after the Eagles won the Super Bowl. Look at anyone wearing a Tom Brady jersey. Spend three hours taking a break from the noise of reality and appreciate the football community that comes together as a Thanksgiving tradition. From the first Thanksgiving game played between Yale and Princeton in 1876 to next week’s matchups, Thanksgiving football will always be an important part of the American identity. Sure, I could say you should watch Thanksgiving football because it features some of the most exciting divisional matchups. I could say it’s at a crucial point in the year when teams are gearing up for a playoff run with games that make or break a season. Or I could even tell you that the New Orleans Saints, who are the best team in football right now, will be playing Thursday night. But that’s not as important as embracing the Thanksgiving spirit to find something meaningful in this crazy, divisive world. So this Thanksgiving, when you’re sitting at the table trying to fend off your uncle who won’t stop asking you about your summer internship plans and stuffing yourself with pumpkin pie, maybe, just maybe, consider turning on the television and indulging in some beautiful Thanksgiving football.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The wrestling team put on an impressive performance at the Jonathan Kaloust Bearcat Open Sunday. The Bears had seven wrestlers competing in the quarterfinals and four in the semifinals, earning 29 wins in total. CJ LaFragola ’19 and Jon Viruet ’19 led the way for Brown, and took home titles in the 184-pound weight class and the 165-pound weight class, respectively.</p>
<p class="p1">LaFragola, a senior from Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey, qualified for the NCAA Championships and earned Second Team All-Ivy Honors in the past two seasons. Viruet, a senior from Springfield, Massachusetts, also qualified for the NCAA Championships last season and served as a co-captain of the team alongside LaFragola. For their excellence in the season opener at the Bearcat Open, LaFragola and Viruet have been named The Herald’s Athletes of the Week.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the great season-opening victories! How does it feel to perform so well at the start of the season?</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">LaFragola: Every time at the start of the season, you always get the first-match jitters. But it’s fun to get out there. Building up to this, we always talk about competing against ourselves, and we finally got to compete against new faces and try out all of the skills that we’ve been working on since last year. So it was really nice to get out there, mix it up a little bit with different people — (it) felt good to get some wins under the belt right away.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Viruet: It felt great to put our practice to work, everything that we’ve been working for since the end of last season. Some of us have been around (on campus) or traveling the country, going to the best clinics that we could possibly go to and see the best coaches that we can. We’ve done a great job of bringing in coaches ourselves, putting that practice to work and being able to see how our improvements have been gained. So it was a fun performance, but there are a lot of things to work on.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>When did you first start wrestling?</b></p>
<p class="p1">LaFragola: I started in fourth grade-ish, and I’ve been doing it ever since. I started after my brother started up, and it kind of got me into it, so I’ve been doing it for a while.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Viruet: My brother is one grade above me, and we started it in our seventh and eighth grade years. We basically started competing with the traveling team, and got our bus work pretty much everywhere we went until we started grinding, becoming tougher and figuring out the sport ourselves. We were three-sport athletes, and eventually, we figured out what was going to be the best for us and our bodies to get to the next level ­— and that was wrestling. So we ended up committing to it in high school. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>What has been your favorite memory of being on the wrestling team in your time at Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p1">LaFragola: For us last year, (Viruet and I) both got to nationals. I went there my sophomore year, but I didn’t have teammates with me, so (last year) it was me, (Viruet) and (Justin Staudenmayer ’18), and it was just a really great experience … to have your teammates out there. It just made the experience so much better to feed off each other. (Viruet) got a great win against a high-ranked, returning All-American and just set the tone for the three of us to go out there and follow him. It helped me as a wrestler, and it was just really fun to be out there with the best guys and get to show your stuff.</p>
<p class="p1">Viruet: I would say Nationals as well. Going out there being prepared as well as we were, getting an unprecedented win against a top-tier opponent was something we expected, but nobody else expected it of us. To gain the support that we did afterwards was phenomenal. To follow up with expectations for … this year, to be that much greater and to have our teammates and our coaches and all of the supporters of the program believing that we could excel to the next level — setting that benchmark and moving forward past that would be the best time I’ve had at Brown thus far.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Do you have any pre-match rituals?</b></p>
<p class="p1">LaFragola: I’m a big music guy. I like to mix it up. I used to play really hard stuff, and now I’ve been trying to tone it back a little. We learned from this sports psychologist that you’re not supposed to be cranked up all the time, so I’ve been trying to play calmer music in between. Then, 15 minutes before the match, I start building it up. It’s like a roller coaster with wrestling. At a tournament, you’ll have four or five matches in a day, so you can’t be all the way up top all of the time.</p>
<p class="p1">Viruet: About three matches before I’ll be up (to compete) at a tournament or dual meet, I like to get my heart rate up and do a few sprints. Outside of that, I listen to pretty typical music:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>hip-hop, R&amp;B and reggaeton, anything native to my culture. I listen to that prior to my warm-ups, and then five minutes out I’ll start changing to a lot calmer music. Specifically, I have one album that I listen to that is a Christian hip-hop album. I do that, and with about two minutes before my match every time, I’ll get a quick stretch in, say a little prayer and get ready to go.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>What are your goals for your final season with the team?</b></p>
<p class="p1">LaFragola: Everyone’s goal is to get on the podium, and that’s it. It’s podium-or-bust, and we’ve got one more shot. We just have to leave it all on the mat, and whatever happens, happens. If both of us wrestle our best match, everyone’s in trouble. When we wrestle at 100 percent, I don’t care if (any opponent is) the national champion. If we bring our “A” game, we could compete with anybody in the nation — just wrestle our hardest and get on the stand.</p>
<p class="p1">Viruet: At this level, the only difference that separates the phenomenal wrestlers from the mediocre ones is intensity and mental toughness. Everyone trains the same way and has the same physical capabilities, outside of a few outliers that might have freak strength. So when we step up toe-to-toe against the best in the country, as long as we are prepared and stay healthy, we feel like we can compete with the best. That was proven last year and has been proven time and time again. We’ve beaten returning All-Americans and national qualifiers and can compete with the best. So the end goal of the season is to get on the podium or possibly at the top of the podium. I personally don’t think anyone is that much better than us in the country, so it comes down to being healthy and prepared for the match.</p>

		<title>Bears finish second winless Ivy League season in a row</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">More than two years ago, the football team walked off Memorial Field in Hanover, New Hampshire as winners following a 24-21 victory over Dartmouth. That was the last time that the Bears won an Ivy League football game. In the last 737 days, Brown has been on the losing end of 15 straight conference matchups, with the most recent defeat coming in a 49-7 rout against the Big Green Saturday. When the team walked off Memorial Field again this weekend, it did so having completed its second straight 0-7 season in the Ivy League, and capped off one of the most fruitless periods for the Bears in the past half century. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This season has shown me that college football is a team game and all 11 guys have to do their job on every play to be successful,” wrote quarterback Michael McGovern ’21 in a statement to The Herald. “This season was tough, but I’m proud to lead and play next to my brothers out there.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The game followed a familiar script for the Bears — one that haunted the team in brutal losses to Cornell and Columbia earlier in the season. The Bears played well enough in the first half to stay in the game, only to collapse in the second. Despite the loss, players spoke highly of their teammates’ commitment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The seniors “are some of the best examples of dedication and perseverance that I have ever witnessed,” McGovern wrote. The offensive line “made a lot of sacrifices to protect the running backs and me. … Every time they go out and give it their all and I’m proud to play behind them.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am “really proud of how the guys went out and competed every Saturday for 60 minutes,” even though the team occasionally lacked a solid running and passing game during the season, wrote tight end Anton Casey ’19 in a statement to The Herald. Dartmouth utilized a dual-quarterback system, featuring Derek Kyler and Jared Gerbino. In just their second drive of the game, the Big Green drove down to the one, and Gerbino faked a run but passed to a wide open Connor Rempel in the endzone to take an early touchdown lead. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears, meanwhile, were able to move the ball early on but had back-to-back drives stall on failed fourth down conversions. Bruno’s only points came on special teams, as Dartmouth muffed a punt that Brown recovered in the endzone. This potentially momentum-shifting play tied the game at seven and put the Bears in position to secure an upset. But it was not meant to be. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears played with high energy in the first half against a Big Green squad that seemingly underestimated them, as Bruno’s defense was able to get crucial fourth down stops and even force a fumble by Gerbino. Though, with just 16 seconds left in the half, Kyler found Drew Hunnicutt on a slant in the endzone to give the Big Green a 13-7 lead at halftime. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dartmouth picked up right where it left off to start the second half, as Gerbino and Rashaad Cooper gashed Brown’s defense with numerous long runs. Cooper capped off the drive with an 18-yard touchdown gallop to extend the lead for the Big Green. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the score, Bruno’s chances for victory evaporated. Dartmouth scored touchdowns on each of its first five drives of the half, to bring its final offensive output to 49 points after earning only seven near the end of the second quarter. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown simply could not match the Big Green’s offensive explosion and was shut out in the final two quarters. While Dartmouth scored on nearly all of its second-half possessions, the Bears punted four times, threw two interceptions, fumbled once and had another turnover on downs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the final whistle sounded, Dartmouth had outgained Brown in total yards 526-248 and first downs 29-16. The Bears were unable to run the ball effectively all season, and displayed this trend again Saturday as the Big Green rushed for 365 yards and Bruno ran backwards for negative 23 yards. McGovern finished the game throwing 34-55 with 271 yards and a pair of interceptions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This loss caps one of the most disappointing football seasons in the program’s history. The Bears only won one game this season, dominating Georgetown University 35-7 in September. Brown’s 1-9 record this year marks the first time that the Bears have won fewer than two games since the team went 0-10 in 1992. The Bears have gone 0-7 in the conference before, but they have never done so two years in a row. Since Ivy League football became standardized in 1956, the only other team in the Ancient Eight to have experienced consecutive 0-7 seasons is Columbia. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have to understand that this family is what takes the field on Saturdays and playing for each other is all that matters,” McGovern wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the team takes the field again next fall, only its seniors will know the feeling of an Ivy League victory. This makes for a long offseason for all of Brown’s players and fans, as the clock keeps ticking since the team’s last conference win in 2016. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Nine of the 11 offensive starters are returning next year, which is huge in terms of experience,” Casey wrote. “The spring will allow these guys to gel and effectively play better as a unit next fall.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have to stick together and work for each other and rebuild this program,” McGovern wrote. “The work towards next season starts right now.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days after the football team capped a second consecutive season without an Ivy League win, Head Coach Phil Estes stepped down from his position after 21 seasons Monday, according to a <a href="https://brownbears.com/news/2018/11/19/coach-phil-estes-leaves-brown-as-second-winningest-football-coach-in-bears-history.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> from Brown Athletics. The Bears finished 1-9 in 2018 and 2-8 in 2017 after losing 15 straight conference games over the past three seasons. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Players were informed of Estes’ departure this morning via an email, in which he thanked them for their hard work and commitment to the program. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s always a lot of talk, but you never really expect something this big to happen so fast,” said starting quarterback Michael McGovern ’21. “Everybody was kind of caught off guard. It was definitely a shock when we all got that email this morning.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The team has not yet met to discuss what Estes’ departure means for the program, but plans to do so after Thanksgiving break. Though he will be an alum when the Bears take the field under new direction next season, Co-captain Anton Casey ’19 voiced expectations about changes to the team. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“As sad as it is to see the coaches that you had for three years leave, the football team needs restructuring,” Casey said. “A coach that can really discipline the guys who are going to play on the team next year is really necessary, because the team needs to get on one page and really bond to one common goal, which is to win.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the 2017 season, Estes had never finished last in Ivy League rankings. In 21 seasons, he recorded 115 victories and three conference titles, and concluded his tenure as the second-winningest coach in Brown football history. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Estes “built a truly exceptional record, not just for Brown football, but more importantly for the generations of student-athletes who came to Brown passionate about playing the game," said Director of Athletics Jack Hayes in the press release. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Brown University took a chance on me more than two decades ago, and the rest is history," Estes said in the release. "I'm deeply grateful to Brown for the opportunity to have coached this team and so many outstanding players. Brown has been a wonderful home for me and for my family.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Estes took over the program in 1998 and achieved early success, winning a conference championship in his second year. But after finishing the 2016 season fourth in the league, the Bears struggled to compete with Ivy opponents. The team won its most recent conference championship in 2008 and hovered near the middle of the pack until falling to the bottom a year ago. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Current student-athletes who played through <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/18/bears-finish-second-winless-ivy-league-season-row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two straight last-place seasons</a> are looking forward to how new leadership will reshape the program. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven’t won a lot of games, and there’s definitely some wounds that need to be healed,” said Co-captain Michael Hoecht ’20. “We’re all going to really miss (Estes). He’s done wonders for this program and I can’t say enough good things about him. But moving forward, it’s going to be important that this new coach is able to sort of unify this team and sort of steer us in the right direction.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The outcome the Bears are hoping for is clear: a winning season and a shot at restoring the program to its former glory. With a young roster and a fresh staff, McGovern is confident that the climb back to the top isn’t impossible. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a lot of talent on our team,” McGovern said. “We’re all ready to work as hard as we can to make sure that happens. Once we get our new head coach and we fully buy into what he’s doing, I fully believe that as long as we stay dedicated and true to ourselves and stay close together as a family, then we definitely have a lot of potential to turn the program around.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayes said in the release that the search for a new head coach will begin immediately. Hoecht said that players are typically kept “out of the loop” until those hires are made by the Athletics Administration, but the co-captain thinks the transition will be smooth. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re players who play for coaches, and that’s up to the administration to make the right decisions,” Hoecht said. “Ultimately, I think a lot of guys will follow whoever we get because at the end of the day, we want to win, and in order to win you’ve got to buy into your head coach.”</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">And then there were two. Chelsea’s 3-1 loss to Tottenham Saturday leaves only Manchester City and Liverpool unbeaten in the Premier League this season. The defeat also puts what seems to be the final nail in the coffin of Chelsea’s title campaign, early in the season though it may be.</p>
<p class="p2">With 33 points over 13 games, Liverpool now sits two points behind City for the league lead. The Reds also rest three points ahead of Tottenham and five ahead of Chelsea. At this point they seem to represent the only realistic competition as City looks for a second straight title.</p>
<p class="p2">However, though Liverpool has valiantly hung in with its competitors to the east so far, City will nonetheless lift silverware come May. The Manchester outfit has simply been too dominant, and while Liverpool will at least keep things interesting for a while, there’s no one stopping City.</p>
<p class="p2">A simple look at City’s 11 wins and two draws to Liverpool’s 10 and three paints a picture of a second place team that is one lucky break away from sharing the lead in points. A closer examination, however, reveals the stranglehold City has on the league.</p>
<p class="p2">Both clubs have been strong at the back so far this year, each giving up only five goals in 13 games. But while Liverpool has been comfortably putting games away by one or two goals, City has been riding roughshod over its competition. Liverpool has found the back of the net 26 times to date, while City has already done so on 40 occasions. City’s resulting plus-35 goal differential is more than that of second-place Liverpool and third-place Tottenham combined.</p>
<p class="p2">That high-scoring offense doesn’t just show itself in easy matches either. While City has run up the score in 6-1 wins against both Huddersfield and Southampton, the team also beat Arsenal and Chelsea by two-point margins without conceding a goal. Against the same opponents, Liverpool has come away with two draws this season, with the tie against Chelsea coming days after a loss to the Blues in a League Cup match.</p>
<p class="p2">Beyond simple statistics, City has consistently shown class, even when tired legs and injuries threatened to slow the team down. Against a well-rested West Ham United Saturday, City scored four times and kept a clean sheet. With most of its players coming off of long travel and extra games during the international break, the Manchester club still managed to score three times in the first 35 minutes — each time making West Ham look like they had no business playing on the same field. In Pep Guardiola’s third season as manager, the team looks to be fully adapted to his system of play, and City practically walks the ball in at will against bottom-half opponents.</p>
<p class="p2">That isn’t to say Liverpool is undeserving of its high league position. The Reds cruised to their own convincing win Saturday, beating Watford 3-0. With an appearance in last year’s Champions League Final on their resume, they certainly stand among the top teams in Europe. Yet City has amassed such a deep pool of talent and implemented such an effective system of play that even a top team in Europe simply isn’t catching the Cityzens.</p>
<p class="p2">Two points may seem to be an insignificant lead with two thirds of the season left to play. To a certain extent it is, but it masks the disparity between the two teams that have still yet to lose in this Premier League season. By the time the busy holiday schedule of games comes to an end, don’t be surprised if that two points has turned into an insurmountable lead for the men from Manchester.</p>
<p class="p2">Right now, the Premier League title race holds the illusion of competition, but as the season wears on, it will become a coronation.</p>

		<title>Bruno loses momentum, falls to Boston University</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/29/bruno-loses-momentum-falls-boston-university/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When forward Sena Hanson ’20 scored eight minutes into the third period to tie the women’s hockey team’s match-up against Boston University, it seemed that Bruno, coming off a four-game stretch without a win, finally had all the momentum. But instead BU fought back, and a trio of third-period goals — the last an empty-netter — were enough to hand the Bears a third straight loss.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Right after our first goal in the third period, we certainly were on a high right there. But this has been a continuing theme throughout the year,” Hanson said. “We’re either ahead or we’re tied, and something happens where our energy levels dip on the bench, then it relates to that on the ice, and we just seem to lose all the momentum.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hanson scored both of Brown’s goals, the first coming 13 minutes into the first period. For 50 minutes, the game was a nail-biter. But after Reagan Rust scored for BU 11 minutes into the third and the Terriers added two points to their lead in the following minutes, Bruno faded away.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our team needs to find a way to be able to play three solid periods,” Hanson said. “Right now, I don’t think we’ve played a single game where we’ve played three very good periods in a row.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Head coach Carisa Wahlig said that giving up two goals in the final minutes of the game was “unacceptable.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We need to be able to buckle down in that situation,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears put up back-to-back upset wins against nationally-ranked opponents the first weekend of November, but ever since, have been unable to recapture the same level of play over a full game. After defeating Colgate and Cornell, Bruno lost 1-0 to Rensselaer, tied Union 2-2, lost 9-1 to Clarkson and fell to St. Lawrence 4-1 before losing to BU.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Having those two games that we won were very nice, but in a sense it got to our heads,” Hanson said. “We’re thinking about the past when we really (should) be looking ahead toward the future, toward the game that we’re actually playing that day.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After starting 5-2, the Bears have now fallen to 5-6-1. These wins already represent an improvement over Bruno’s 2017-18 2-27 record, but Wahlig said the team should not be satisfied. The Bears need to enter every game with a winning mindset, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We can’t fall back into the trap of going into games and wondering how much we’re going to lose by, or if we’re going to lose,” she said. “That’s an automatic recipe for disaster.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Defender Abby Niewchas ’19, who assisted Hanson’s game-tying goal in the third period against BU, agreed that it was essential for the team to maintain its confidence. “That’s something that we’ve been lacking, going into games with confidence knowing we can compete with the teams that we’re playing against,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Besides confidence, the Bears have another pressing issue to deal with: One player, Hanson, has scored almost a third of the team’s total goals. Hanson has nine goals; no other player has more than five. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I don’t think, as a coach, you’re ever okay with just one person putting the puck in the net,” Wahlig said. “That makes it very easy for other teams to have your number when you come in to play them.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Niewchas and Hanson both saw silver linings in the loss. Hanson said the team’s work ethic has noticeably improved since last season. “This year, we’re willing to work that much harder to win some more games,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Niewchas stressed the need to remain positive. “I don’t know any team that’s been successful when they’ve been down on each other,” she said. “Building off of what we do well and working on our mistakes is how we move on as a team.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One game remains for the Bears this semester: the annual Mayor’s Cup game next Tuesday against Providence College. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(The winner of) the Mayor’s Cup, that’s the best team in Providence,” Wahlig said. “In this situation, if as a player you’re not up for a game like that, then I’m not really sure if you belong at this level.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hanson stressed accountability, and Niewchas emphasized positivity. Both echo themes that Wahlig has underlined in the past as part of the culture she has attempted to bring to the team. But entering the game against Providence, and as the season continues, Wahlig also emphasized the importance of competitive spirit and sustained hard work. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">While most students left campus for Thanksgiving break last week, the men’s basketball team went to work, defeating Bryant University and Salve Regina University. Tamenang Choh ’21 delivered an impressive performance for the Bears, averaging 12.5 points per game and shooting an efficient 75 percent from the field. In the victory against Bryant Sunday, Choh posted a career-high five blocks and grabbed six rebounds. With this weekend’s results, in addition to a 71-51 loss to the University of Rhode Island Wednesday, the Bears sit at 5-3 on the season.</p>
<p class="p2">Choh, a sophomore forward from Lowell, Massachusetts, started 12 games last season. He has previously been named Ivy League Rookie of the Week and was awarded Brown Student-Athlete of the Week honors for his play over Thanksgiving. For his outstanding performances against Bryant and Salve Regina, Choh has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Herald: Congratulations on the victories last week. How does it feel to get two big wins against Bryant and Salve Regina?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Choh: It feels really good. I know how good our team is, so getting these wins means that we’re doing the right things, which is always good.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>When did you first start playing basketball?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I started playing officially in the third grade … starting on an actual team. But I was always playing in the park since I was a little kid. So for a long, long time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Why Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I liked the coaches. The coaches here had a good relationship with my (Amateur Athletics Union) coach. My coach highly recommended this school, so after taking a couple of visits, I liked it.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you have any pregame rituals?</b></p>
<p class="p2">I have two wristbands that I like to kiss and keep in my socks. They remind me of people who have passed away in my life. I like to keep those on me when I play.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What is your favorite memory of playing on the basketball team so far?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Probably the game-tying basket (that I made) last year against (Providence College), and sending it into overtime. That was pretty memorable for me.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What are your personal goals for the season?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Probably to be First-Team All-Ivy — that’s a pretty big goal for me personally. Before all of that though, I’m trying to make it to the Ivy League tournament.</p>
<p class="p2">I<b>s there a specific game or match-up that you’re excited for this season?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Honestly, just all of the Ivy League games. A lot of them we lost in very close games (last season). So trying to get those games back and (beating) those teams is going to be the most important.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What are the team’s goals for the season?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Our goals are to make the tournament and win the Ivy League.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears will return to the court in a road match-up against the United States Naval Academy Saturday at 4:00 p.m.</p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Do these NBA underperformers have any hope?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We are over a month into the NBA season and not much has gone according to expectation. Yes, the Golden State Warriors remain in position to win another championship. But a couple of other contenders have looked shockingly vulnerable. Almost everyone predicted that the Boston Celtics and Houston Rockets would enjoy strong seasons. Boston was a popular pick to be the Eastern Conference champion, while the Rockets seemed poised to enter the playoffs as a high seed in the Western Conference. Yet neither of these 2018 final four teams has looked all that impressive, playing average or below-average basketball much of the way so far. Can the two franchises turn their fortunes around?</p>
<p class="p2">The Celtics have plenty of depth. The names on their roster jump off the page: Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, etc. Adding in role players like Marcus Smart, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier and Aron Baynes makes Boston’s 11-10 record all the more inexcusable. There’s no way a team this talented should have the same record as the Charlotte Hornets. But the Celtics have a lot of very real and scary problems. Hayward and Horford appear to have declined considerably, lacking their former explosiveness. Hayward has struggled coming back from a severe leg injury and can’t defend, get to the rim or shoot well right now. Horford, meanwhile, isn’t getting enough lift on his jump shot and might have lost some lateral quickness over the offseason.</p>
<p class="p2">The declines of these two cornerstones have furthered the confusion over team roles. Should Hayward be allowed to play crunch time minutes in his current state? Is Brown a starter and an offensive contributor beyond standing off to the side and waiting for the ball? How many ISO midrange jump shots should Tatum take? Everyone is jostling for minutes. It’s a cliché to say there’s only one ball, but it’s proven shockingly apt for the Celtics so far — there are simply too many talented players to share the ball effectively.</p>
<p class="p2">The Celtics should be a much improved team at the end of the season, even though their start has not impressed. Irving is playing like a new man on the defensive end, putting up much more of a fight than he has in years past. Pair that defense with his usual stellar offensive output and you have a superstar. Hayward should improve a little — while his contract has turned into an albatross, he can help shoulder more of the offensive load once he adjusts to his new decreased level of athleticism. Tatum, meanwhile, just has to rein in his shot selection a little. And it’s hard to imagine Brown continuing to play this poorly. While the Toronto Raptors have established themselves as the best team by far in the Eastern Conference, all the other contenders have their own issues. The Milwaukee Bucks have gone 8-6 after their 7-0 start. The Philadelphia 76ers narrowly escaped some defeats to poor teams. The Indiana Pacers have been inconsistent. The Celtics can still claw back to a two seed, but this is starting to look like another year where Boston falls in the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>
<p class="p2">The Houston Rockets, however, are in major trouble. The middle of the Western Conference possesses a lot more firepower than the middle of the East, so the Rockets don’t have the luxury of waiting for a hot streak. The team has a 9-11 record, second-worst in the entire conference (which just goes to show how tight the standings will be down the stretch). Every win matters in the West. One game could decide a playoff appearance. The Rockets are mired in a four-game losing streak and seem headed in the wrong direction. I don’t have a lot of faith left in this bunch.</p>
<p class="p2">Chris Paul’s hamstring issues continue to bite after costing him dearly last season. Paul’s body broke down in the playoffs under the strain of heavy minutes and now those problems are back after only a few games. He hasn’t played like his usual self even when on the court. At 33 years of age, Paul simply cannot be relied upon anymore as a consistent second star next to James Harden. And he has a lot more money headed his way: $160 million over four years. That contract could get really ugly.</p>
<p class="p2">Houston made the right decision in quickly ditching the failed Carmelo Anthony experiment, but depth continues to be a major problem. After Harden, Paul (when healthy), Clint Capela, Eric Gordon and PJ Tucker, who can play big minutes in a playoff series? James Ennis III? Gary Clark? Michael Carter-Williams? While Ennis III has filled in admirably, there are simply not a lot of players on the Rockets I would trust to play 30 minutes against the Warriors. Or even the Oklahoma City Thunder, for that matter.</p>
<p class="p2">Harden continues to be phenomenal. But in the last few minutes of the game, he can’t take every single shot. That formula doesn’t work. Harden gets tired and worn down, then makes mistakes with all the opposing defensive intensity channeled toward him. Can he lead Houston to a four seed? Yes. But if the Rockets want to move past the second round of the playoffs, they need to make a trade. And fast.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following a 17-day hiatus over Thanksgiving break, the men’s hockey team resumed conference play on the road this weekend with a 5-1 loss to No. 17 Clarkson University Friday and a 2-2 tie against St. Lawrence University Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saturday night, Nolan Aibel ’20 equalized the game late in the second period to send Brown (1-6-2, 1-4-2 ECAC) into its second overtime contest of the season. Joachim Weberg ’21 and Justin Jallen ’22 scored Friday and Saturday, respectively, while Brady Schoo ’19 recorded a pair of assists against the Saints.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 1, Clarkson 5</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Friday night, Weberg scored in the second period to bring the Bears within one goal of the Golden Knights (8-5-0, 2-2-0), but a trio of unanswered Clarkson goals put victory out of reach for Bruno.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Golden Knights opened scoring in the first minute of the game as Kevin Charyszyn found the back of the net on a one-timer 44 seconds into the contest. Marly Quince extended the lead for Clarkson late in the stanza, sending a shot into the Brown goal from between the circles.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Bears responded early in the second period, when Weberg redirected a feed from Chris Berger ’21 past Golden Knights netminder Jake Kielly. Berger maneuvered around a Clarkson defenseman through the right circle and sent a pass across the crease, where Weberg tapped the puck past Kielly to narrow the deficit to one. Dorian Dawson ’22 also recorded an assist on the play.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aaron Thow widened the Golden Knights’ advantage to two with a goal midway through the stanza. Though the Bears’ offense remained persistent, outshooting Clarkson 10-6 in the final period, the Knights tacked on a pair of goals — including one on the power play — to secure the victory.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In net, goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20 posted 23 saves. The Bears went 6-for-7 on the penalty kill in the contest.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We were working hard but sometimes not working intelligently — we got away from some systematic things,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “We needed to come back with a much different effort … on Saturday and I thought we responded very well.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Brown 2, St. Lawrence 2 (OT)</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The following day, the Bears dominated possession from the drop of the puck, outshooting the Saints 23-4 in the first period and 44-22 overall. Aibel scored the equalizer late in the second stanza to send the teams into overtime.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We were all over them — we’re at our best when we’re cycling down low, maintaining possession in the offensive zone and getting pucks up quick in the neutral zone,” Aibel said. “We were doing all that and we were getting a lot of pucks to the net. … I think we just have to bear down on our chances a little bit and we’ll find some wins in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jallen put Bruno on the board with his third goal of the season late in the first period. After having his initial shot denied, Jallen finished off his own rebound in a play that was sent to video review and ruled in favor of the Bears.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Saints (2-11-1, 0-3-1) responded with a pair of goals in the span of a minute and a half to gain an advantage early in the second frame. Andrew McIntyre sent a backhand shot from the slot past Brown netminder Luke Kania ’21 three minutes into the stanza before Alex Gilmour converted on St. Lawrence’s second power play of the evening to reclaim the lead.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears continued to pressure the St. Lawrence net and leveled the tally when Aibel collected a pass from Schoo and launched a shot past Saints goaltender Emil Zetterquist late in the second period.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a scoreless third stanza, Kania made four key saves in overtime to preserve the tie.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Saturday was a real step forward for us — we played the way we wanted to and I think we definitely did enough to win that game,” Weberg said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t come away with a win, but it’s always good to get at least one point on the road.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I like a lot of things we did in the game, and if we continue to trend upwards with those habits, with those systematic things that we stress, it eventually will lead to wins,” Whittet said. “We just can’t deviate — we’ve got to play as a team and I did see that on Saturday and I was very happy to see … how the guys responded to a Friday night game where we weren’t at our peak.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking ahead, Whittet emphasized the importance of playing with tenacity around the net in order to convert offensive opportunities into goals.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve got to find a way to bear down around the net a little better … We’re gripping the stick a little tight right now,” he said. “If we continue to get the chances we’re getting, eventually it’ll go in. But it’s a situation where, in practice, you’ve got to constantly stress finishing drills, making sure that you’re depositing pucks in the net.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the first half of the season draws to a close ahead of the winter break, the Bears are preparing for a pair of home games against Union College and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute this weekend. The team hopes to carry the momentum from Saturday’s matchup into the contests.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We haven’t gotten the results that we wanted the past few weeks, but we’re confident in our ability (and) we’re confident in all of our teammates, our coaching staff and our game plan as a team,” Weberg said. “We’re getting better and better every day, and I think that showed on Saturday.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This weekend, it’s important for the team to “really put all of our energy into these two games, hopefully come out with four points and put ourselves in a good spot after Christmas break,” Aibel added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bears return home to host Union Friday and RPI Saturday at Meehan Auditorium. Face-off is at 7 p.m. both nights.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Coming off of a victory over Wagner College and a defeat against Rutgers University, the women’s swimming and diving team powered to a first-place finish in the Bruno Invite this weekend. The Bears hosted Dartmouth, Princeton, the University of Miami, Johns Hopkins University, Villanova University and Rider University in the three-day long meet. Brown led the scoreboard throughout the weekend and finished with 992 points after amassing 269 on day one and 637 by the end of day two. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“One of our major mantras for this meet is to swim with ‘no expectations, but not low expectations,’ which has made the past two days of racing extraordinarily exciting,” said Kelley Tackett ’20, Herald copy desk chief. “There’s a lot of energy behind the blocks that just keeps building off of every swim.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears earned numerous first-place finishes throughout the meet and started the weekend by tying a program record of 1:31.21 in the 200-yard freestyle relay. Miku Takabayashi ’22 also set a school record of 2:01.19 in the 200-yard individual medley race Friday. Other notable performances included a second-place finish for the 200-yard medley relay team and a third-place, 54.72 second performance from Andrea Wei ’22 in the 100-yard butterfly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “Especially compared to two years ago when (the Bruno Invite)was here, (the competition) is a lot faster,” said Sarah Welch ’20. “It’s giving us a better opportunity to race and to see how we’re doing.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the final night of the meet, Bruno clinched the victory with a few clutch performances. In the 100-yard freestyle, the Bears dominated, as Taylor Seaman ’21, Marley Cross ’20 and Maddie Salesky ’19 took home the top three places. Brown won first place in the 400-yard freestyle relay with an impressive 3:18.90 time from the team of Salesky, Seaman, Cross and Tatiana Prendella ’19. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“One advantage to big invites like (the Bruno Invite) is getting to swim against competitors from outside the league,” Tackett said. “More competition always means more opportunities to get better, and we’re working hard to claim our space in and among the top scorers of the invite.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Behind the Bears in the final standings, Princeton finished in second place with 852 points, followed by Villanova, Miami, Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins and Rider.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s really exciting to beat (Princeton) because … they are usually some of our biggest competition,” said Julia Benz ’20. “(There is) a lot of good competition, a lot of good swimmers (and) a lot of good divers. We’ve had a lot of people come and watch, which is really great. … We’ve had a record turnout, so it’s really fun.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will return to competition with a meet against Ivy League rivals Penn and Harvard<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in Cambridge, MA<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jan. 12.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following tournaments at Binghamton University and the United States Naval Academy, the wrestling team headed west to Las Vegas this weekend to take on several of the nation’s best teams at the prestigious Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational. The Brown wrestlers struggled to build momentum throughout the tournament and finished 35th out of 43 teams. Positives for Bruno included a top-20 upset by Trey Keeley ’20 (125 lbs) and a solid performance from Colin Realbuto ’22 (141 lbs).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Brown wrestlers recorded a combined 6-18 record on the weekend, with Keeley, Realbuto, Zachary Krause ’20 (149 lbs), Christian LaBrie ’19 (157 lbs) and Jonathan Viruet ’19 (165 lbs) all picking up wins. “It was a true test to see where we are at and what we need to work on,” said Head Coach Todd Beckerman.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keeley began with a match against Drew Hildebrandt of Central Michigan University. Trailing 1-0 entering the third period, Keeley had a chance to earn the tying escape, but Hildebrandt earned the rideout to hold on for the win. Still, Keeley advanced in the consolation bracket thanks to a medical forfeit, setting up a showdown with Cole Verner from the Univesity of Wyoming, who was seeded 11th in the tournament and ranked 20th in the country by FloWrestling. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keeley kicked off the match against Verner with a bang, using a slick inside trip to pick up a takedown and two nearfall points. After a Verner escape, Keeley used a single-leg takedown to jump out to a 6-1 lead. Verner clawed back and cut the lead to 6-5, but failed to execute on a risky throw, extending Keeley’s advantage and setting him up for the 15-9 win. Keeley was eliminated from the tournament by Tyshawn White in his next match, but he relished his win over Verner, his first against a ranked opponent. “My coaches have instilled confidence in me that I can hang with these guys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s no reason that I should lose to a guy just because he’s ranked. … I’m right there with the best of them,” Keeley said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Realbuto faced third-seeded Michael Carr of the University of Illinois in his first match, putting up a valiant effort in an 8-3 loss. But Realbuto rebounded in his next match against rival Trevor Tarsi of Harvard, using a strong ride in the second period and a late takedown in the third to seal the win. Though Realbuto lost to ninth-seeded Nate Limmex of Purdue University in his next match, Beckerman was impressed with his performance. “Realbuto looked good as a freshman coming out here for the first time,” Beckerman said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Krause got off to a hot start, as he dominated Ethan Wendell of Highline College in a 15-0 technical fall. Krause then gave third-seeded Grant Leeth of the University of Missouri a close match, falling by a score of 9-5. But during a consolation bout, Krause suffered an injury and was forced to forfeit the match, ending his tournament. LaBrie also put up a 1-2 record on the weekend, defeating Kizhan Clarke of American University.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Viruet, who entered the tournament seeded 10th and ranked 19th in the country, controlled Tanner Skidgel of Navy in his first match, racking up eight nearfall points off of tilts en route to a 14-0 victory. This set up a match with seventh-seeded defending Junior World Champion Mekhi Lewis of Virginia Tech. Viruet could not break through the defense of the positionally-sound Lewis and fell 6-4. In the consolation, Joshua McClure of the University of North Carolina used multiple low doubles to upset Viruet and end his tournament run. “I personally would say that I perhaps underperformed, but I’m not going to make excuses. There’s a lot of things we need to learn as a team,” Viruet said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hunter Kosco ’21 (133 lbs), Bryce Rogers ’21 (174 lbs), CJ LaFragola ’19 (184 lbs) and Ian Butterbrodt ’19 (285 lbs) each went 0-2 in the double-elimination tournament. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will face another stiff test in their next competition, the Midlands Championships held at Northwestern University Dec. 29 and 30.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is a perfect time, during reading period and exams, to work on the technique that they need to work on,” Beckerman said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>James Perry ’00 hired as head football coach</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">James Perry ’00 was named the University’s 20th Head Football Coach Monday afternoon. This appointment follows the Nov. 19 departure of former Head Coach Phil Estes, who led the team for 21 seasons, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/19/phil-estes-steps-21-seasons-head-football-coach/">previously reported</a>. Perry played for the Bears from 1996 to 2000 and served as quarterbacks coach from 2007 to 2009. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The rest of the team (and I) are all very excited to play for James Perry,” said defensive captain Michael Hoecht ’20. “He’s a great coach, has an impressive resume and is going to do great things for this program.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 1999, Perry led the Bears to an Ivy League title as the team’s starting quarterback. His 3,225 passing yards and 27 touchdowns helped him earn Ivy League Player of the Year that season. In 2008, with Perry on the sidelines as the Bears’ quarterbacks coach, Brown won the Ivy League title again. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m extremely pleased to welcome James Perry back to Brown as our head football coach,” wrote Director of Athletics Jack Hayes in a <a href="https://brownbears.com/news/2018/12/3/james-perry-named-head-football-coach.aspx">University press release</a>. “James is a proven leader who has excelled in all aspects of his career — as a player, assistant coach and head coach. He has the determination and experience to lead the Brown football program back to the upper echelon of the Ivy League.”</span></p>
<p class="p2">Perry is taking over a team that finished last place in the Ivy League the past two seasons under Estes. Despite this losing streak, Estes was a three-time Ivy League Champion and is the second-winningest coach in Brown history with 115 victories.</p>
<p class="p2">After Perry finished his prolific career as Bruno’s quarterback, he served as the assistant quarterbacks and wide receivers coach at Dartmouth, quarterbacks coach at Williams College and a graduate assistant coach with the University of Maryland football team.</p>
<p class="p2">In 2007, Perry rejoined the Bears as the quarterbacks coach under Estes and helped Brown win the 2008 Ivy League championship. By 2010, Perry was the offensive coordinator at Princeton, where he crafted an explosive offense that won two Ivy League titles in 2013 and 2016.</p>
<p class="p2">Perry earned his first head coaching job with Ocean State rival Bryant University in 2017.</p>
<p class="p2">In his two seasons with Bryant, the team averaged more than 30 points per game and posted consecutive 6-5 records.</p>
<p class="p2">Perry has been able to create quarterback-friendly offenses in many of his previous coaching positions. At Brown, Michael Dougherty ’09 became a top Ivy League quarterback during the 2008 championship run, finishing his career with the eighth most completions in the history of the Ancient Eight. In Perry’s seven seasons at Princeton, three of his quarterbacks were selected as Ivy League Players of the Year. This resume will prove helpful for Bears’ quarterback Michael McGovern ’21, who had a promising first season as a starter, throwing for the 39th most passing yards in the nation with 2,202 yards and eight touchdowns.</p>
<p class="p2">Perry’s “success at the schools he has coached is impressive, and the Brown community should be excited about him coming back home,” McGovern said. “Personally, I’m very much looking forward to being coached by a (former) Brown quarterback, especially one who had the success that he had.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Junior guard Justine Gaziano ’20 notched 35 points last weekend as the women’s basketball team breezed past Bryant University 84-68 at the Ocean State Tip-Off Tournament. Coming off Honorable Mention All-Ivy honors last year, Gaziano was named to the All-Tournament team and averaged 30 points per game against Bryant and the University of Rhode Island. The Natick, Massachusetts native is 14th all-time in scoring for the Bears and a recipient of the Royce Sports and Society Fellowship. For her standout performances in Bruno’s tournament play, she has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>Herald: You scored a career-high 35 points last weekend against Bryant. How did it feel to be such a big part of the team’s offense?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Gaziano: It was just in the flow of the game and everyone on our team was contributing and doing well. … There were definitely some things we struggled with, but we were able to all come together, and I just happened to be hitting a lot of my shots that game. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>You also led the team in scoring against URI. Do you feel like you’re hitting your stride on offense?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I’ve really just gotten into a flow of what I can do and (a flow of) the team as a group all working together and sharing the ball, which has been a great part of our success. We’ve been racking up the assists as a team, which has definitely allowed us to do well on offense. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>You’ve recently been named the Ivy League Player of the Week. What does that award mean to you?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">It’s a really nice honor that it’s recognized by the Ivy League, but … I wouldn’t have been able to do it without my team and the way that we’re able to work together. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>You recently scored your 1,000th college point and sit 14th in all-time scoring for Brown. Do you focus at all on reaching milestones like that?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A thousand points was a goal I’ve wanted to reach since I came to Brown. I didn’t know when it was going to happen but it’s one that I’ve been working toward and wanting to reach, so it was really great that I was able to reach that milestone. But now I know that there’s even more that we can all achieve as a team. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>What are you focused on achieving next?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Just continuing to be the best player and teammate that I can be to put our team in a position to do well.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>You currently lead the team in three-point percentage. Is that a part of your game you try to work on specifically?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">I think three-point shooting has always been something that’s been a strength of mine and something I’ve really worked toward. So, when I’m in a game, (my three-point shot is) something I look for on offense. … And I think recently I’ve gotten into the flow of shooting.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><b>What is the team expecting from the rest of the season as you approach Ivy League play next semester?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">We’ve definitely struggled in a few games, but it showed us what we need to work on so we can be successful in the Ivy League, which is what we see as most important. It’s been a good way for us to recognize some of our weaknesses and things we need to work on so that when we do get into conference play we’ll be able to capitalize and do well. </span></p>

		<title>Poll reveals 28.9 percent of students find athletics ‘somewhat unimportant’</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Free pizza, t-shirts and Coca-Cola products have not been enough to draw students to Brown Stadium for football games, save for the annual Family Weekend contest and the highly-anticipated rivalry against Harvard. Throughout the rest of the season, the bleachers remain mostly empty, aside from devoted parents and a handful of undergraduates who leave campus to support friends.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The poor student attendance at Brown athletic events is consistent with the results of The Herald’s 2018 Fall Poll. While 79 percent of varsity athletes considered athletics to be at least somewhat important to the Brown community, just 42 percent of non-athletes shared this sentiment. Thirty-one percent of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>respondents who are non-athletes consider athletics to be somewhat unimportant to the community and 15.3 percent felt they were very unimportant. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both athletes and non-athletes who were asked about the poll were not surprised by the results. While athletes equated the measure of importance with the community service their teams participate in, camaraderie built among teammates and the potential of their sports to bring the Brown community together, multiple student sources felt that the general student body associated importance with success in terms of wins and losses. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The divide in perspective between athletes and non-athletes is not unfamiliar to members of varsity teams that frequently lack broad student support. Field hockey co-captain Katie Hammaker ’19 noted that most of the fans in the stands are student-athletes who play on other teams. Claire Harrison ’20 pointed out that Brown excels in sports that don’t typically draw large crowds, such as crew.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> The gymnastics team “is ranked (nationally) in the 50s,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>said Julia Green ’19, the team’s co-captain. </span><span class="s3">“If we were ranked in the 30s, we would get just as many people. For the more obscure sports, I don’t think (success) matters.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“That’s just not the culture of this school,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But both athletes and non-athletes recognized that victories alone may not be enough to generate student enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Everybody wants to go see a winning team,” Hammaker said. “If we did win, there would be more support, but you’ll always have those people who just don’t enjoy sports, don’t want to go watch sports ever — whether they win or whether they don’t win. (Winning) might help a little, but it wouldn’t completely alleviate the problem.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maddie Griswold ’21 hypothesized that a major sports team would have to perform exceptionally well to “change the culture” at Brown to one that is more invested in athletics. As a co-manager of the men’s lacrosse team and an editor for Brown Sports Convos, a club that publishes online content focused on professional sports teams, Griswold has noticed that even Brown students who enjoy watching sports casually aren’t especially interested in the Bears. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In coming to Brown, I knew what I was giving up,” she said. “I knew that I was prioritizing top-notch academics over (a big sports culture).” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the Ivy League started as an athletic conference, Brown students no longer feel a strong connection to that part of the college experience. Brian Solomon ’19 has never attended a sporting event at Brown and does not consider athletics important to the community. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I have no need to watch Brown play Columbia (in football) and lose,” Solomon said. “That just sounds like a really boring game.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Regardless of on-field performance, athletes identified the social aspect of athletic events as a potential draw for students.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The most exciting thing at the football game isn’t getting a first down on a third-and-long,” said quarterback Michael McGovern ’21. “The most exciting part is being there, because the environment is fun to be in. Everybody that you’re with is on the same team. You’re all rooting for the same thing.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Football co-captain Michael Hoecht ’20 shared his teammate’s view of games as a way to bring students together into one community. But non-athletes didn’t view sporting events as social gatherings — none of the students interviewed recalled attending games solely to spend time with friends or meet new people. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The wrestling team stumbled in a 32-6 loss to Army last Thursday, but found their footing on Saturday as they picked up close wins over Franklin &amp; Marshall College and Bucknell University. Brown entered the matches missing several starters due to injury, but newcomers Reese Fry ’22 (125 lbs), Samuel Lynch ’22 (149 lbs) and Cade Wilson ’22 (174 lbs) all stepped in and earned crucial individual victories. The three matches kicked off Brown’s first homestand of the year as well as its conference dual season.</p>
<p class="p2">Both of Saturday’s matches came down to the wire and were decided by the final match at heavyweight. Against Franklin &amp; Marshall (2-4, 0-3 EIWA), the Bears (4-2, 2-1) were up 21-15 going into the heavyweight bout, meaning James Valentino ’21 (285 lbs) had to avoid giving up a pin against the Diplomats’ Antonio Pelusi to seal a win for Bruno. Fortunately for Brown, Valentino only gave up a 1-0 decision, allowing the Bears to hold on 21-18. The roles were reversed against Bucknell (3-6, 1-3 EIWA), with Bruno facing an 18-14 deficit with only one match left. After the Bears sent out Ian Butterbrodt ’19 (285 lbs), he pushed the pace in his match against Brandon Stokes to force five stalling warnings against Stokes, resulting in a rare disqualification on stall calls. The unconventional heavyweight victory clinched a 20-18 comeback win for Brown.</p>
<p class="p2">“This weekend was a total team performance; we needed all ten wrestlers and everyone else on the team to help propel us to these two victories,” said Head Coach Todd Beckerman.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bears hoped to pull an upset against a tough Army team (5-2, 5-0) Thursday, but the Black Knights’ prowess from the top position proved to be too much to handle for Brown. Army’s wrestlers earned near fall points in six of their eight victories, as they cruised to their fifth conference win. Army took a 20-0 lead before finishing with a 32-6 edge. The only Brown wrestlers that managed to stop the bleeding were Jon Viruet ’19 (165 lbs), who eked out a 5-4 win over Cael McCormick, and CJ LaFragola ’19 (184 lbs) who defeated C.J. Morgan 5-2.</p>
<p class="p2">Bruno got off to a far better start against Franklin &amp; Marshall. Trey Keeley ’20 (125 lbs) used a wide variety of attacks including a double underhook throw by to beat Jose Diaz 8-5. Fry then picked up a 13-4 major decision despite bumping up from his regular weight class of 125 pounds. Colin Realbuto ’22 (141 lbs) continued the momentum with a win of his own, putting Brown ahead 10-0.</p>
<p class="p2">“We didn’t come out with the right fire we needed to get the job done,” LaFragola said of Brown’s match against Army. “On Friday we reset and got our focus back, and knew we had to come out hot against Franklin &amp; Marshall.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Diplomats earned their first win of the match when Wilfredo Gil won a high-scoring 9-8 bout against Jack Bokina ’22 (149 lbs), Granby rolling to a reversal with short time on the clock. Still, a pin by Viruet and a technical fall by LaFragola allowed the Bears to pull ahead for the 21-18 victory.</p>
<p class="p2">In the match against Bucknell, it was Brown that needed a comeback. Losses in the first three weight classes put Bruno in a 12-0 hole. Desperately needing a win to shift the momentum in their direction, Brown sent Lynch to face Bucknell’s Matt Kolonia. Kolonia held a decisive 11-6 lead with less than 20 seconds remaining, but Lynch went for broke and took Kolonia down to his back, just barely holding him long enough to earn four near fall points and the dramatic 12-11 win.</p>
<p class="p2">“One thing that my coaches have been stressing with me in the practice room is just wrestling all the way until the end … because you can always score until you hear the buzzer,” Lynch said of the ending of his match.</p>
<p class="p2">“(Lynch’s) win was much needed at a crucial time; we call it a swing match ­— that was the one that really turned the tide,” LaFragola added.</p>
<p class="p2">The victory against Bucknell also featured crucial wins in the upper half of the lineup by Viruet, Wilson and LaFragola.</p>
<p class="p2">“We suffered a pretty significant loss to Army, and I think we came back with a different mindset,” Lynch said. “As a team we had a lot more energy, we were really getting excited on the bench. … That definitely translated on the mat.”</p>
<p class="p2">Brown will take on two more Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association rivals next Saturday when they face No. 16 Cornell at 11 a.m. and Binghamton University at 7 p.m. in the Pizzitola Sports Center.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Though Alexa Dannis ’22 began her collegiate skiing career only two weeks ago, she has wasted no time in finding success. In her first race at Okemo Mountain in Ludlow, Vermont on Jan. 10, Dannis led Brown by finishing fifth in the slalom. Then, Saturday she won the slalom race at Crotched Mountain in Francestown, New Hampshire with an exceptional time of 1:30.90, leading Bruno to fourth place overall. For these standout performances in her first two college-level races, Dannis has been named The Herald’s Athlete of the Week.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Herald: What got you started in skiing, and when did you become competitive?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Dannis: I started skiing when I was about three. (National Standard Race) is a public course that’s up on the mountain, so I did that a couple times with my family. My parents don’t ski which is actually kind of weird for a skier. I just did the NASTAR over and over again and forced my parents to let me ski race.</p>
<p class="p3">I grew up in New York, so it wasn’t the best skiing, and then I moved to New Hampshire and went to (the Holderness School), which is one of the only schools that’s a real school but also has a good ski team. It was either that or a ski academy but I opted for (Holderness).</p>
<p class="p3"><b>You led the team in both slalom races so far this season. What do you attribute your early success to?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I took a gap year last year so I was just in Aspen, just skiing the whole year, … which is pretty helpful.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>You picked up your first win in a college-level race at Crotched Mountain. What does that mean to you?</b></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was really awesome. College racing is a lot different from individual racing, … because you have to race for the team, so it’s more about finishing. In the past I’ve sometimes done really well in a race and then crashed in the next race, but in college you have to finish so that the team can do well. So that was a little bit different for me. But I just skied conservatively and smoothly. I’m really excited for how the season’s </span>going to go.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Brown finished fourth place in the first slalom race at Crotched Mountain. How do you feel about the overall success of the team?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I think we’re definitely on the up. We have a couple of people injured right now but they’ll be back soon, so I think we’re going to do even better in the upcoming races.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>What do you consider the keys to a good race, including pre-race preparation?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Visualization, and just being in the right mindset. Just treating it like training and not giving it anything extra, but being prepared and having your equipment ready.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>What’s the most difficult part of skiing for you? </b></p>
<p class="p3">The most difficult part is definitely the amount of time you have to put into skiing. It takes hours to tune your skis and to drive all the way to the mountain. You have to inspect the course, and take some free runs and warm up, and then all of it boils down to one minute on the course. You can mess up an entire day and have to go home because you’re one inch to the left instead of to the right and you straddle a gate and you fall, or you just mess up and get off your line. So the toughest part is that it could all be over within a split-second decision.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>What do you enjoy most about skiing?</b></p>
<p class="p3">I like the competition and the feeling of your skis slicing the snow and going fast… Also, I like when your teammates are supporting you in competition and (that the entire ski community knows) each other.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>What are your goals for the rest of your freshman season?</b></p>
<p class="p3">We definitely want to make Nationals this year, which seems pretty attainable when we get the rest of the team back. A personal goal would be to keep doing well in the races.</p>
<p class="p3">The women’s skiing team will return to the slopes this weekend at Whiteface Mountain in Lake Placid, New York.</p>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: In the baseball’s hall: heroes or history?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Baseball Writers’ Association of America released its Hall of Fame balloting results earlier this week, and the vote did the institution proud. Four players were inducted, all of whom were deserving; it was, in essence, a nice, happy Hall of Fame class. But beneath the bubbly exterior, there are questions that need to be answered if the BBWAA hopes to maintain credibility among baseball fans and wants the Hall of Fame to maintain its clout.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Curt Schilling remained on the ballot, unelected; should the Hall of Fame induct someone who has spouted inflammatory and often nonsensical rhetoric? Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, of course, saw their vote totals increase slightly, but remain far from induction: Do two players who are undoubtedly the best of their generation, but also sullied the integrity of the game, deserve enshrinement in Cooperstown? Other performance-enhancing drug users have slipped further down the ballot. If Bonds and Clemens are inducted, do the voters need to induct these players — Sammy Sosa, Manny Ramirez, Gary Sheffield — too?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But it seems that these questions are really just versions of the only important question: What exactly is the point of all this? What is the point of the Hall of Fame?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the most part, there are two possible answers. On the one hand, there are those who believe that the Hall of Fame is meant to celebrate the best of baseball, that being inducted to the Hall of Fame should mostly be about honoring the game’s finest. On the other hand, a sizeable camp believes that the Hall should be a museum of baseball: It should capture as much of baseball history as possible, and the induction process should be based on whether or not players on the ballot have made enough of an impact to deserve a spot in baseball history.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So which is it? And what does the answer mean for the future of Hall of Fame voting? The answer seems clear to me: the Baseball Hall of Fame must remain an institution to reward and recognize the greatest athletes in baseball, which means the vetting process for inductees must be thorough. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the Hall is just a baseball museum, then many of its current traditions make little sense. There are induction speeches every year, for instance; people often give speeches when they’re being honored, but if the Hall is about history rather than honor, induction speeches seem out of place. One could argue that becoming part of history is itself an act of praise, but that’s just avoiding the issue: If it is an honor, then Hall of Fame inductees are being lauded, and voting should reflect that.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So, the Hall of Fame can dispense with honorific elements entirely — it can stop allowing induction speeches, stop celebrating its inhabitants and turn into a true museum, providing an important narrative of baseball history. Or it can take the opposite tack: It can continue celebrating its inductees as it currently does. Speeches, plaques, celebrations of Hall of Famers and their accomplishments … the Hall can continue functioning as a celebration of baseball and induction will remain an honor, rather than simple codification of history.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But if induction is an honor, we need to think carefully about the names on the ballot, and whether they deserve to be celebrated.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take Schilling, for instance. The day after the Hall of Fame results were announced, Schilling tweeted at an account with 181 followers, “Let me get this straight. Your dumb ass is trolling me on twitter because a majority of voters thought I should be in Major League Baseballs HOF? That’s another level of stupid right there. #idiot.” Is this someone we want to honor? The person who in 2016 tweeted a racially inflammatory and threatening image toward journalists — should he be inducted into the Hall, if induction means he is being celebrated, honored and given a stage from which to speak in front of thousands of people?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s a similar question to be asked for Bonds and Clemens. If the Hall takes the museum approach, then of course they belong: They are some of the most important figures in recent baseball history. But if the Hall wants induction to remain an act of praise rather than a mere expression of what voters believe constitutes history, then we have to ask: Do Bonds and Clemens deserve to be praised? Should they be cheered on stage by thousands, then enshrined on glowing, laudatory metal plaques for posterity, if we are fully aware that they used performance enhancing drugs? Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens certainly deserve to be remembered in baseball history, but celebrating them is a step too far.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both approaches to the Hall have supporters, but those who advocate for the museum approach need to answer some questions. For one, if the Hall is nothing more than a museum of baseball history, why support only Bonds and Clemens for induction? What about Manny Ramirez, Rafael Palmeiro, Pete Rose, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Alex Rodriguez? If the Hall is going to be a home for all figures important to baseball history, regardless of doping or other character scandals, don’t we need to induct all players with historic-level numbers? And for another, if all the honor is removed from Hall of Fame enshrinement … well, do we really want that? Do we want to see players treated like museum exhibits rather than honored as heroes of the sport?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Induction to the Baseball Hall of Fame is baseball’s highest honor, and should continue to be so. And as long as induction is an honor, potential inductees need to be thoroughly deserving of celebration before they join the ranks. That means no Bonds, no Clemens, no Pete Rose, no Schilling … These people are being considered for the highest praise in the great American game. If there’s any need for asterisks, clarifications or statements that “he was a great player BUT…,” then that honor is more than they deserve.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following a series of wins during the winter break, the men’s hockey team continued to heat up this weekend with a pair of victories over New York opponents Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and No. 16 Union College. The Bears recorded their first shutout of the season with a 3-0 sweep of the Engineers Friday, before earning a 3-2 victory over the Dutchmen to close out the road trip the following night.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a really important weekend for us,” said goaltender Gavin Nieto ’20. “We needed to come out and have a good weekend in order to move up in the standings. … We played well this weekend and did the things we needed to do, (and) more importantly we played really well defensively and capitalized on some defensive breakdowns of the other team.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The wins come after Bruno (8-9-3, 5-5-3 ECAC) bested Robert Morris University and Union (12-7-4, 5-6-1) to take home the Three Rivers Classic tournament crown in early January. The Bears split their last weekend at home with a victory over St. Lawrence and a loss to No. 10 Clarkson, and currently sit at seventh place in the league standings, four points behind joint leaders No. 12 Cornell and No. 20 Yale.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 3, RPI 0</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday night, a trio of third-period goals fueled the Bears to their second victory of the season against the Engineers (7-17, 4-9). Brent Beaudoin ’20 bookended the final stanza with a pair of tallies and Zach Giuttari ’20 also scored to power Bruno to the shutout win. In net, Nieto made 19 saves, recording the second clean slate of his career.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We just showed a lot of character in our team, our ability to find ways to win and just dig deep when it mattered most,” said Michael Maloney ’22.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The teams exchanged blows from the drop of the puck, notching five shots each in a scoreless first period. Late in the frame, Brady Ferner found the back of the net for RPI on a shot from the slot, but the goal was disallowed after video review due to goaltender interference.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nieto stopped nine shots to preserve the score in the middle frame, including a series of saves against RPI’s power play unit late in the stanza. Beaudoin opened scoring seven minutes into the third, redirecting a shot from Justin Jallen ’22 past Engineers netminder Owen Savory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Two minutes later, Jack Gessert ’20 won a faceoff in the RPI zone and sent the puck to Giuttari, who fired a wrist shot past Savory from the left circle to widen Bruno’s lead. Beaudoin sealed the victory for the Bears with an empty net goal in the final minute.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You have to be able to manage the game and capitalize on (the opponent’s) mistakes, and we did that,” said Head Coach Brendan Whittet ’94. “We were very, very solid defensively, we didn’t make a lot of errors with the puck and we pounced on them when they did.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Brown 3, Union 2</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following day saw the Bears match up with a familiar foe as they took on the Dutchmen for the third time this season. Maloney scored the game-winning goal late in the final period to cement the victory and give Bruno a 2-0-1 advantage in the series against Union.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Dutchmen opened scoring early as Liam Morgan sent a backhanded shot into the Brown net on the first shift. But the Bears fought back with intensity, equalizing the game midway through the period as Jake Harris ’22 deflected a shot from Will Scherer ’19 past Union goaltender Jake Kupsky.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bruno continued to apply offensive pressure in the Dutchmen’s zone, notching an 11-6 advantage in shots on goal in the first stanza. Colin Burston ’21 gave the Bears a lead late in the second period, directing the puck into the net off a feed from Gessert. Gessert capitalized on a turnover behind the Union goal and sent the puck to Burston, who was waiting to finish the play at the top of the crease.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jack Adams evened the tally again four minutes into the final stanza, but Maloney blasted a shot past Kupsky from the left circle with three and a half minutes remaining to secure the victory for Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The team has found greater depth in its production across lines, which has contributed to its recent successes, Maloney said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our depth and all four lines kind of rolling, all buying in and contributing in their own ways has been a huge success for us,” Maloney said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re getting production up and down our lineup — it’s not just one line or a small group of guys that are producing for us,” Nieto added. “That’s been a big positive for us — that we don’t have to rely on one specific line or a set group of people, we can kind of roll lines and be confident that anyone can go out there and produce for us and help us win games.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears seek to carry momentum from their recent successes forward into the remainder of their season, which continues with a visit to Ivy rival Yale. Prior to the end of regular season competition in March, the team looks to climb further up the ECAC standings and ensure home ice advantage for the playoffs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve been able to win some games here after break and kind of get on a little run, so … we’ve just got to keep our confidence up and do the little things right in order to get some more wins and continue to move up the standings,” Nieto said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For us to get four points on the road was a good step in the right direction,” Whittet added. “We’re a team that’s trending upwards, we’re a team that’s growing and we’re a really dangerous hockey team right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears return to action with a visit to Yale Saturday. Face-off is at 7 p.m.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The men’s and women’s fencing team had only one chance to compete at home this season, and the Bears made it count with impressive victories and a combined 9-1 record in a Northeast Fencing Conference meet Saturday. The women’s team went four for five on the day, besting the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dartmouth, Vassar College and Tufts University. Meanwhile, the men’s team toppled Brandeis College, Dartmouth, Vassar and Tufts but were foiled in a 19-8 loss to MIT.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s really great to fence at home, just because everyone comes out to support us,” said Nathan Sinai ’21, who posted a 12-3 record in men’s epee.</p>
<p class="p2">Sofija Podvisocka ’21 and Signe Golash ’21 both posted undefeated 12-0 records with Podvisocka competing in women’s epee and Golash in women’s sabre. Captain Umar Masood ’19 also notched an undefeated 15-0 mark on the day in men’s foil.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’ve progressively gotten better throughout the whole season. I think we are really coming together as a team under our new head coach, Alex Ripa,” Masood said. “We dropped a close one to MIT, but I think we’re fencing great and morale is high.”</p>
<p class="p2">Other notable individual efforts included a 14-1 record in men’s epee by Timmy Frank ’22 and a 10-2 mark by Elena Jin ’21 in women’s foil.</p>
<p class="p2">This weekend’s performance featured numerous dominant victories by the fencing team at the squad level. On the men’s side, epee twice put up an 8-1 mark to lift Bruno to a tight 14-13 victory over Brandeis and a 20-7 win against Tufts. Additionally, men’s foil went 8-1 against Dartmouth in a 19-8 win.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’ve had a pretty strong season,” Sinai said. “We have a really young team this year, and had a lot of people graduate last year. So, it’s been nice to get (the younger fencers) into the spirit of college fencing.”</p>
<p class="p2">Women’s foil was especially commanding in victories against MIT and Dartmouth. The Bears posted records of 9-0 and 9-0, respectively. Women’s epee also earned impressive marks with an undefeated 9-0 record against Dartmouth and an 8-1 victory to top Tufts. In total, the women’s team soundly defeated many of their opponents Saturday, as the squads led the way to a 24-3 defeat of Dartmouth, a 22-5 win against Tufts and a 21-6 victory over MIT.</p>
<p class="p2">“The season has been going pretty well for the women’s team,” said captain Ebba Brunnstrom ’19. A “big goal for today was that we did not want to lose against any schools.” For the season, Brunnstrom hopes the women’s team will continue to grow.</p>
<p class="p2">This weekend’s NFC meet demonstrated the best performance by the fencing team since their first NFC meet Nov. 17, when the women’s team earned a 6-1 record while the men’s team notched a 3-2 mark. The Bears will return to the piste in the Eric Sollee Invitational at Cambridge, Massachusetts Feb. 3.</p>
<em><strong>A previous version of this article stated that women's foil bested Brandeis College 8-1, when in fact women's foil lost to Brandeis 1-8. In addition, a previous version of this article stated that Elena Jin '21 posted a 13-2 mark in women's foil, when in fact her mark was 10-2. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wrestling drops matches against Cornell, Binghamton</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wrestling team was defeated by both Cornell and Binghamton University Saturday, losing 42-6 to the Big Red and 19-15 to the Bearcats. Bruno found tough sledding against a No. 10 Cornell team that had five of 10 wrestlers ranked in the top 20 nationally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the matchup against Binghamton, both teams each won five individual matches, but bonus points in three of their victories gave the Bearcats the edge.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Five wrestlers picked up wins Saturday for Brown (4-4, 2-3 EIWA). Jon Viruet ’19 (165 lbs) was the only Bear to go 2-0 on the day and the only one to win his match against Cornell (8-2, 3-0). Trey Keeley<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>’20 (125 lbs), Christian LaBrie ’19 (157 lbs), Nino Bastianelli ’21 (197 lbs) and Ian Butterbrodt ’19 (285 lbs) each won their match against Binghamton (4-3, 3-2).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Keeley, Reese Fry ’22 (133 lbs) and Colin Realbuto ’22 (141 lbs) were pitted against the Big Red’s highly ranked lightweights to begin Saturday’s first dual. Vitali Arujau, ranked No. 11 in the nation, used a variety of takedowns to defeat Keeley 16-3 while 12th-ranked Chas Tucker earned a takedown with two seconds left in the match to seal a 20-5 victory over Fry. Realbuto was able to fight off his back against first-ranked defending national champion Yianni Diakomihalis for about a minute to avoid giving up a pin, but ultimately lost the match. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Big Red kept rolling as Jonathan Furnas and Adam Santoro defeated Sam Lynch ’22 (149 lbs) and LaBrie, respectively. But Viruet provided a highlight for Bruno in the dual, pinning Cornell’s Andrew Berreyessa.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “I went into that match trying to wrestle my own style,” Viruet said of his win. “I’m pretty comfortable (in tough) positions, whether it’s underhooks (or) overhooks,” Viruet said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cade Wilson ’22 (174 lbs) put up an impressive effort against 15th-ranked Brandon Womack, getting a reversal and riding out Womack for the whole third period, but a strong second period by Womack proved crucial in an 8-5 decision. Cornell won the final three matches decisively to conclude their 42-6 win. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Later that day against Binghamton, Keeley turned things around in a match against Steven Bulzomi, to whom he had lost earlier in the year, defeating<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>him 4-3. With Keeley in bottom position and time winding down, he drew a stalling penalty from Bulzomi at the buzzer to take a two-point victory. However, Binghamton responded by winning the next three matches to put Brown in an 11-3 hole. In the 157-pound match, LaBrie locked up double underhooks and threw Chris Barker to his back for six points in the first period, and held on for the eventual 7-6 victory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m a very tall 157-pounder, so if I can get close to a leg and then build up to the body lock, since I’m very long, I can get my hands wrapped (around my opponent),” LaBrie said of his winning throw. “Once my hands are locked I usually can secure a body lock to bring the guy to his back.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Viruet won a dramatic overtime match against 165-pounder Aidan Monteverdi to follow up LaBrie’s close victory. Neither wrestler was able to generate much offense throughout the match, but Viruet earned the winning takedown on the edge in sudden victory. Wins by Bastianelli and Butterbrodt, by identical 6-2 scores, closed out the close defeat for Brown. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The match against Binghamton was part of Brown’s annual “Rumble and Tumble” event, where the gymnastics team competed alongside the wrestlers in the Pizzitola Sports Center. Head Coach Todd Beckerman thought the atmosphere of the event could have rattled some of his more inexperienced wrestlers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a different atmosphere; it was loud, it was not the norm (the freshmen) were used to,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beckerman said. “But that’s what we like about this; it’s going to prepare them for the conference tournament and ultimately the NCAA Championships with 20,000 screaming fans.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears will look to get back on track next Saturday as they head on the road to take on Penn and Princeton.</span></p>
<strong><em>Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article stated that Reese Fry's weight class is 133 lbs, when in fact it is 135 lbs. In addition, a previous version of this article stated that Trey Keeley bested Steven Bulzomi by a score of 5-3, when in fact the actual score was 4-3. The Herald regrets the error.</em></strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sachan &#039;22: How can the NFL improve the Pro Bowl?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The National Football League postseason is the highlight of the year for football enthusiasts. The best teams in the league play tough playoff football. Every game is an elimination game, and each week the matchups get more exciting right up until the Super Bowl. Except for one misstep. Somewhere in the middle is something called the Pro Bowl: a middling attempt at an all-star game that the NFL has to change.</p>
<p class="p2">The Pro Bowl has problems. Players don’t want to get hurt, and fans don’t want to see a game where nobody, including the players, cares. It’s not the players’ fault. Football is a dangerous sport where one injury could jeopardize an athlete’s future to play and earn lucrative contracts. Because of this, a lot of players decline to show up. The NFL then scrambles to find replacement players (remember when Tyrod Taylor was in the Pro Bowl?) until they can put together a full roster. Beyond the problem of players declining to show up, the Pro Bowl selection process is flawed. Fans make up one-third of the votes on who plays; while I understand why the NFL would want fans to be more involved in the game, Pro Bowl nominations have serious implications, since players often receive bonuses if they are invited to the Pro Bowl. Beyond that, the number of Pro Bowl invitations a player receives is frequently referenced as a sign of his greatness. Fans are highly biased and tend to pick the players who play for their favorite teams, not the best players. The current process leaves players feeling commercialized and fans just wanting to fast-forward to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p class="p2">So should the NFL scrap the Pro Bowl? Definitely not. All-star games are magical. There’s something to be said for bringing together the best players in the world. Team rivalries disappear, and all of these playmakers can show off their skills.</p>
<p class="p2">From a pragmatic perspective, it also doesn’t make sense to get rid of the Pro Bowl. The Pro Bowl makes the NFL a lot of money. Beyond that, the two-week gap before the Super Bowl allows the league to coordinate logistics and gives Super Bowl teams time for injured players to recover, making the game more competitive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the Pro Bowl is here to stay, the question becomes: How can the NFL make it better?</p>
<p class="p2">There are a lot of directions the NFL can take the game. First of all, Pro Bowl selections are important, both to players’ salaries and their legacy, so let’s see that reflected in the selection process. There should be a committee of independently affiliated sportswriters selecting Pro Bowl nominees, like the much more reputable All-Pro and Hall of Fame selections. That would help avoid the Pro Bowl snubs that we see year after year.</p>
<p class="p2">Another simple improvement would be focusing more on the smaller competitions throughout the week, such as the Gridiron Gauntlet and Dodgeball. The skills competition is my favorite part of the Pro Bowl; it’s one of the only opportunities for fans to watch players compete without pads and helmets. It helps us see them as people and not as football players. Therefore, there should also be more events for every position. Let’s get the special teams’ players involved. Let’s see circus catch competitions for wide receivers. Let’s see offensive linemen compete in sack races. Let’s see some flag football with wide receivers playing quarterback and vice versa. The NFL needs to get more creative to design games that showcase the players’ superhuman athletic abilities. The more fun the NFL can introduce into the Pro Bowl, the more fans and players will appreciate it.</p>
<p class="p2">As for the actual game, the NFL is already going in the right direction. They’re trying to make the Pro Bowl faster by reducing the time between plays from the typical 40 seconds to 35 seconds. Other changes include allowing coaches to communicate with multiple players on offense and defense during a play, compared to only talking to the quarterback or middle linebacker in a usual NFL game. This should make the game much more dynamic.</p>
<p class="p2">While some sportswriters want to raise the stakes by giving $250,000 to the winning team, I believe<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that a payout is against the nature of the Pro Bowl. No player should get injured during the Pro Bowl, and increasing the prize money would definitely incentivize hitting harder and risking injury. While I love the big hits just as much as any other fan, what does it say about the game if we want to see players hit each other more than we want to see safe, competitive play? In this sense, the NFL faces an impasse. At the highest levels, there is no way to guarantee safety, and in trying to do so, we lose some essence of the game. That’s why it can be viewed as a good thing that players are cognizant of their long-term health and playing future. A better idea to make the game more exciting is changing the playbook to bring in more college trick plays. I want to see more defensive players on offense. I want to see more wacky formations. Fans want to see all of the fun play designs that teams are too afraid to bring out in the regular season.</p>
<p class="p2">Additionally, the fundamental flaw with the AFC vs NFC format is that not enough people identify with such large conferences. Each division could have its own seven-person team, similar to how the NHL All-Star game functions. By dividing the teams based on smaller divisions such as the NFC East or AFC North, fans will be much more invested in their division’s success and there would be an actual storyline. This wouldn’t take away from any of the competitiveness of the game.</p>
<p class="p2">I love the idea of an all-star game, and for so many reasons the league has to keep it. There are a lot of directions the NFL could go with the Pro Bowl, but the only wrong move would be changing nothing at all.</p>
