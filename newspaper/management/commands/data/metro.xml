		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Rhode Island School of Design student was robbed Friday at approximately 6 p.m., according to a community-wide email from the Department of Public Safety. The incident occurred near the intersection of Benefit and Meeting Street.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While walking at night, the student was approached by three males, one of whom was wielding a silver firearm. After taking the student’s backpack, the men fled the scene, potentially in the direction of downtown Providence. The student complied with the accosters and escaped the incident unharmed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The three suspects are all described as being about 5’7” and between 20 and 25 years of age. The first was wearing a dark leather jacket over a dark sweatshirt. The other two were described as being heavy set, one covering his frizzy hair with a red ball cap.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the incident, DPS has increased patrols in the area and encourages community members to review the department’s guidelines for safety awareness on their website.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone with information on the incident should contact the Providence Police Department at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">401-272-3121</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>U. health care experts express concern over Obamacare repeal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Within hours of his inauguration, President Donald Trump set forth an executive order to roll back the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, potentially impacting thousands in Rhode Island. Now, doctors at the Alpert Medical School worry about what their patients stand to lose.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the health law is repealed, 79,000 Rhode Islanders may lose health insurance coverage and 10 percent of the state’s population would be put at risk, said Dr. Nitin Damle, president of the American College of Physicians and clinical assistant professor of medicine at the Med School. An additional 165,000 non-elderly adults could be declined coverage because of pre-existing conditions, he added</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dr. Ira Wilson, chair of health services, policy and practice at the School of Public Health, expressed concern over the consequences a repeal would have on Rhode Island’s economy. Like many other states across the nation, Rhode Island receives “a whole raft of economic benefits — some direct, some indirect — from (Obamacare),” Wilson said. He added that Obamacare drastically improved coverage rates and increased revenue as a result. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wilson supported the expansion of the Medicaid program in states like Rhode Island, which increased its coverage under Obamacare. He added that Rhode Island’s official healthcare exchange, HealthSource RI, has insured roughly 35,000 people in the state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When more Rhode Islanders use health care, further revenue goes back to state institutions, ranging from hospitals to home care agencies. With a surge in revenue, these institutions “hire people, and the people they hire pay taxes,” he said. “There are these trickle-down economic and multiplier economic benefits that are accrued from a state like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Additionally, Wilson worried about the impacts for Rhode Island’s most at-risk populations. Under Obamacare, “the rate at which people became insured preferentially benefited underrepresented minorities because they are highly represented in the poor,” Wilson said. Should the 20 million people under the health law lose insurance, those most at risk are low income populations — often racial and ethnic minorities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dr. Amal Trivedi, associate professor of health services, policy and practice and associate professor of medicine, raised similar concerns. He said that a repeal of the health law would “put their access to medical care at risk (while) also leading to potentially catastrophic out-of-pocket expenses for those who are uncovered.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While President Trump’s executive order backs the steps that Congressional Republicans have already taken to dismantle Obamacare, the health law’s ultimate form remains unknown. Some physicians like Damle hope a replacement will retain key aspects of Obamacare. Specifically, Damle valued keeping young adults on their parents’ insurance and continued coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Though some have said that this replacement plan is supposed to cover as many people (as possible), have more generous coverage and cost less for the government, I tend to view a plan that can do all three of those things very skeptically until I can see the details,” Trivedi said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While some object to the future repeal of Obamacare, Kelly Conway, president of the Brown College Republicans, rejects Obamacare on constitutional grounds. “I don’t think the solution to bad insurance companies is to become a health care provider through the government.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trump’s administration wants “to enact mechanisms to make treatments prices more transparent,” Conway said. “How they’re going to do that, I don’t know, but if they can find a way to do it, I think it would be beneficial.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article had the title "Med School professors express concern over Obamacare repeal." In fact, some of the professors interviewed for the article hold primary faculty appointments in the School of Public Health, which is separate from the Alpert Medical School. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sen. Whitehouse addresses controversial vote</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D-RI spoke to a crowd of constituents Sunday night at Nathan Bishop Middle School in Providence, fielding the political concerns of Rhode Island’s largely democratic base and providing a field map for future resistance against President Donald Trump. Though Whitehouse originally organized the event as a community dinner, attendees shirked the meal for intense conversation with their elected representative.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the notion of a community dinner may traditionally elicit ideas of unity, the night’s start was rocky, underlying the divisiveness that has become so normalized in the aftermath of the contentious 2016 election. After some were excluded from the at-capacity auditorium, chants of “Take it outside” were interwoven with the dull thuds of fists railing against the room’s closed doors. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While people could RSVP on Whitehouse’s government website, an unofficial public Facebook event for the dinner entitled “Sen. Whitehouse, we expect better!” attracted nearly 1,200 interested individuals and centered on Whitehouse’s vote to approve Mike Pompeo as director of the C.I.A. Pompeo has been criticized in the past for his statements condoning torture as an interrogation tactic.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“On that vote, you deserve an explanation,” Whitehouse said. “I concede here I may have been wrong.” Whitehouse explained that he confirmed Pompeo to create a “cordon of maturity” around the Oval Office — a group of intelligent, moral officials to counter Trump on particularly odious decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After being prompted by several audience members, Whitehouse went through the list of Trump nominees he expects to deny, including Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education and Rep. Tom Price R-GA as Secretary of Health and Human Services. But much to the chagrin of several particularly vocal attendees, he could not commit to obstructing Trump or his nominees at every given opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, Whitehouse went further than some of his Democratic colleagues in speaking openly about the potential for impeachment proceedings against the president. Pushing the protesters to show up to the polls for the 2018 midterm elections, Whitehouse emphasized the importance of putting more Democrats in the House of Representatives so they can begin impeachment proceedings “if they so wish.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Whitehouse’s mention of impeachment, while only a little over a week into Trump’s term, echoed the feelings of fear and concern voiced by many who attended the event.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m a Muslim. I’m one of those 1.7 billion people he’s so scared of,” a woman from the crowd called out. “This isn’t about terrorism; this is about my daughter.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providence resident Amy Small told The Herald that Trump’s executive order limiting travel and immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries was especially worrying. “This country is founded on freedom of religion and the First Amendment,” Small said. “This decision goes against our foundation as a nation of immigrants.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hilmy Bakri, president of the Islamic School of Rhode Island, echoed Small’s sentiments in his introduction of Whitehouse. The ban foments distrust of the Muslim-American community, Bakri said. “Even though it affects my community directly, we should all be concerned.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Whitehouse responded to questions for nearly two hours, eventually moving the gathering outside so that all attendees could participate. While the event had started more contentiously, many reported by the night’s end that they felt somewhat heartened by Whitehouse’s presence and determined plan for resistance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Just listening to him come out and answer questions gave me some peace of mind that this isn’t the end of the world,” said Barrington resident Gary Birkowitz.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Part of that assurance likely came from Whitehouse’s mention of the “considerable distaste,” he has seen from many congressional Republicans in response to Trump’s first actions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m seeing a real patriotic concern among Republicans about what he means for our country, not only their party,” Whitehouse said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If the bad decisions continue it won’t just be an issue on our side. His side will start to erode around him,” he said. “The Ides of March are coming.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following President Donald Trump’s inauguration, members of the Brown community protested<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>at the Women’s March on Washington and at sister rallies in cities around the world Jan. 21 and 22. The Women’s March began as a grassroots movement and grew to over 460 marches in the United States and over 200 marches internationally on all seven continents, with about five million participants total, according to the march’s website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Women’s March rallied for women’s rights, which included an intersectional array of causes, such as supporting reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, worker’s rights, civil rights, disability rights, immigrant rights, environmental justice and the end of police brutality and racial profiling.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“A lot of people have the misconception that the Women’s March organization is anti-Trump, and they are not anti-Trump. They are not anti-anything. They are pro-human rights,” said Nancy Rafi, Rhode Island chapter coordinator of the Women’s March.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown community members travelled far and wide to show their support for the march’s platform, in addition to advocating for other causes they feel are under threat from the new presidency. For example, Milisa Galazzi ’88 drove eight hours to and from Washington D.C. within 28 hours to show her support for social justice and climate change. Many other community members chose to show their support locally in Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Washington D.C. hosted the largest march with about 485,000 people, according to estimates by FiveThirtyEight, while over 7,000 people attended the sister march in Providence, said Shanna Wells, who organized the local rally.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I and others fear that it’s going to be long, scary road ahead, and so we needed to fortify ourselves to resist white supremacy, heterosexism, misogyny, plutocracy, neoliberalism, colonialism and further environmental degradation,” wrote Naoko Shibusawa, an associate professor of history and associate professor of American studies who marched in Providence, in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elizabeth Hoover MA’03 PhD’10, assistant professor of American studies, joined a delegation led by Indigenous Women Rise at the march on Washington, where she stood in support of missing indigenous women and the protestors at Standing Rock fighting against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“As a trans person, knowing that a Trump presidency essentially means that I might not be able to transition for another 4 to 8 years if I ever wanted to — that’s very difficult for me and kind of terrifying,” said Sam, a student who uses the pronouns they, them and theirs and whose name has been changed because they have not come out to their parents as trans-femme. “I think of Trump as an embodiment of the current world in which we live. I think of Trump as a manifestation of white supremacist, patriarchal capitalism.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The tipping point for so many women has been this new administration that has come into power,” Rafi said. “I don’t know many women who do not feel threatened.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A majority of signs at the march in Washington D.C. affirmed women’s rights and reproductive rights, wrote Ella Kotner ’19 in an email to The Herald. Protesters also chanted slogans such as “my body, my choice,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many Brown community members who attended both marches advocated for abortion rights. Professor of History Joan Richards wrote in an email to The Herald, “I stood up for women’s reproductive rights, including rights to abortion. I am (a) very strong supporter of Planned Parenthood.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the march’s attempts to be inclusive and intersectional, this emphasis on reproductive rights <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/us/abortion-foes-compete-womens-march-turnout.html">alienated some</a>. But “women who believe in the pro-life mission statement still have other issues that fall under the Women’s March movement,” such as reproductive health education, Rafi said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Additionally, the march’s focus on female genitalia excluded trans women, Sam said. “I think the march sent the message that woman equals having a vagina and that all people with vaginas are women,” they said of the Providence march. “I don’t think the vast majority who attended the march brought in any sort of nuance to their reclamation of the vagina. To be fair, reclaiming the vagina is incredibly important, but there are thoughtful, interesting ways of doing it that the march didn’t do,” they said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many protesters attended the march on Washington with members of their family as well as close friends and colleagues from Brown. Evelyn Lincoln, professor of history of art and architecture and Italian studies, attended the march with over 10 Brown faculty and community members.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Community members said that the march was peaceful and succeeded in fostering a sense of community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There were so many people that the march couldn’t even proceed as planned because the route was so crowded,” Kotner wrote. “That being said, everyone was incredibly friendly and welcoming.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Every group was represented, whether it was race, religion, orientation (or) gender identity,” said John Sheehy ’07, of the march in Washington D.C.. “In the end, I just thought it was great that all of these movements were kind of coming together.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The march even transcended some political divides and brought supporters for Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) together, Shibusawa said in a follow-up interview with The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the march’s title, the attendees were not limited to just women. “It was definitely mostly female but there were a lot of guys,” Sheehy said. “There was one dude who was probably 6 feet 10 inches or something that had a sign that said, ‘I’m a giant feminist,’ and it was just perfect.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Women’s March plans to take its next steps through its campaign, “10 actions in the first 100 days.” The first action is writing postcards to senators.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Community members are also thinking about ways to build on the momentum of the Women’s March. Shibusawa plans to continue the discussion at Brown this semester through a historical perspective in her seminar AMST 1940V: “Decolonizing Minds: A People’s History of the World.” She also plans on becoming more active in local Rhode Island politics. She regularly calls and writes to her representatives and is exploring ways to work with local leaders to protect the health and welfare of Rhode Islanders.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I am trying to partner students with local organizations in the community such as Jobs With Justice. Day-to-day conditions of what’s on the ground in Providence is really important,” she said. “Especially if you send younger students out there, (they) will think about getting off the hill and think wider than about just here at Brown.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For many young people, the Women’s March was the first time they participated in a national protest, Shibusawa added. “It’s kind of a big tent. So it’s great if we can get people who got motivated or scared about what’s happening to go out and do more.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For Lauren Karpinski ’18, the march on Washington was her first national protest. She plans to stay involved through her board position on the Brown Progressive Action Committee, a local activism group formed in the wake of Trump’s election.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sam plans to continue their trans and social justice activism at Brown and in Providence by working with the LGBTQ Center, as a sexual assault peer educator and acting in a play about trans issues, among other means of advocacy.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>RI education leaders speak out against DeVos nomination</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">President Donald Trump’s nominee for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos could seriously impact education in Rhode Island by privatizing public education or cutting federal grants used to help students pay for higher education, some advocates of federally-funded public eduation fear. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DeVos “is interested in privatizing public education, and we believe that public education is the underpinning of our democracy,” said Sarah Friedman, co-director and co-founder of the nonprofit Learning Community Charter School. She added that their school takes a stance against profiteering charter schools of the kind that DeVos may plan to expand. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Over her career, DeVos has supported taxpayer-funded and privately-run education, a departure from the current system of government-run and -regulated schools. According to National Public Radio, nearly 80 percent of charter schools in DeVos’s home state of Michigan — where she has worked to introduce charter schools — are run by for-profit companies. When asked in her Jan. 17 confirmation hearing, DeVos would not take a stance against cutting current public education funding or privatizing public education. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Friedman argued that public education cannot be called public if it is “influenced by profit-making corporations or religiously-affiliated organizations … and that is very much (DeVos’s) agenda.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Learning Community said it is committed to the original intent of charter legislation, “which is to be incubators that support innovation within the larger public education system,” Friedman said. “Any move to privatize our public education system will fiscally … undermine the districts that we are supposed to be supporting,” Friedman said, adding that privatization will also make the charter sector “less publicly accountable.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For The College Crusade of Rhode Island — a college access and success program for about 4,500 students every year — the biggest concern regarding DeVos is whether or not she would support Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan’s 2016 budget plan, calling for a 10-year freeze on spending increases to the Pell Grant program.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Every Rhode Island student deserves the chance to learn and gain the skills they need to get ahead. The mission of the U.S. Department of Education is to give them that chance,” wrote U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D-RI a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-announces-opposition-to-devos-nomination">press release</a> last Thursday. Whitehouse added that promoting quality education requires understanding the importance of Pell Grants, which can make higher education affordable for students hoping to pursue college.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There are eight million students in this country from low- and modest-income families that rely on Pell Grants to pay for college,” said Andrew Bramson, president and CEO of The College Crusade of RI. “Tuition and room and board costs will continue to increase,” he said, arguing that DeVos should reject any cuts to the program.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bramson added that Pell Grants are the largest source of aid most of his students receive. The grant is currently valued at a maximum $5,815 a year for those that receive a full award, which is granted to nearly all of The College Crusade’s students who enroll in higher education. Bramson explained that the purchasing power of the grant for attending a four-year institution has decreased from 70 to 30 percent since 1980. Losing the Pell Grant would leave students “out on a limb in terms of how they’re going to cover tuition, living expenses, books and materials.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">College Crusade receives a majority of its funds through the U.S. Department of Education’s grant program GEAR UP — Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs. Congress is slated to reauthorize the Higher Education Act — the law concerning federally-funded student aid programs — in the next year, which makes it “critical” for groups like College Crusade that Devos continues to support GEAR UP by including it in the act’s reauthorization if she is confirmed, Bramson said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In terms of supporting student voices, the Providence Student Union, a youth-led organizing group, feels that DeVos is “kind of a question mark,” said Executive Director Zack Mezera. But the union recognizes DeVos’s “track record of undermining traditional education structures,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mezera said the union is concerned not only for the direct changes DeVos could bring about — such as the Department of Education’s policy with vouchers — but also indirect changes that could upset individual states’ departments of education, which have been working on their own plans to implement the Higher Education Act, Mezera said. The Rhode Island Department of Education has already put together its own compliance plan, and Mezera said he worries DeVos’s changes could disrupt that work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Under DeVos’s regulation powers, “she could take the plans that RIDE submits and put a big red “X” on it,” Mezera said, adding that months have already been spent on community forums and input sessions related to R.I.’s compliance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For states that haven’t shown a strong regard for federal laws regarding education, DeVos could approve their plans “without reading into how they make interventions regarding student equity or racial disparities,” Mezera said. He added that Rhode Island can address these issues on a state level, but “some states need federal intervention.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Despite concern, liquefaction facility plans move forward</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Updated on January 31, 2017 at 12:50 p.m.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">National Grid is waiting to receive its Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificate, which will give the company permission to proceed with plans to install a natural gas liquefaction facility at its Fields Point site. After filing for a FERC certificate in April, National Grid is expected to receive its certificate in early 2017. Construction is slated to begin in March, but the project has already drawn controversy and criticism from Rhode Island environmental justice groups that advocate against liquefied natural gas.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Environmental groups believe that the facility’s usage of natural gas will harm the environment and threaten the health of residents in neighboring Washington Park, said John Berard, Rhode Island state director of Clean Water Action, a national environmental advocacy group. “Clean Water Action does not support the construction of any new fossil fuel infrastructure,” Berard said, adding that the construction of this new facility is counterproductive to Rhode Island’s efforts to move to a more sustainable energy economy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Residents of R.I. and New England depend on National Grid to supply fuel to their homes particularly at the coldest points in the winter, said David Graves, R.I. director of strategic communications for National Grid. Installing an on-site liquefaction facility would allow National Grid to produce its own LNG, which is made by cooling natural gas to a liquid form, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, National Grid imports LNG from sources abroad, but this system can become treacherous if National Grid imports from tumultuous regions, Graves said. Recent terrorist attacks near a liquefaction site in Yemen threatened to jeopardize National Grid’s domestic LNG supply, Graves said. He added that the Fields Point liquefaction facility would bring National Grid a reliable source of LNG and safeguard against shortages.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If built, this project offers the potential to diversify sources of gas supply (in the state),” wrote Brenna McCabe, public information officer for Gov. Gina Raimondo in an email to The Herald. She added that an on-site liquefaction facility would “create an economic hedge against more price volatile (and foreign-sourced) LNG supplies.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Mayor Jorge Elorza believes that funds would be better spent investing in energy conservation and renewable sources, wrote Victor Morente, press secretary for Mayor Elorza, in an e-mail to the Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elorza spoke out against the liquefaction facility in an Aug. 25 press release, arguing that it would derail state efforts to combat the effects of climate change.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Berard and Morente both expressed concern about the safety risks the facility could pose in the short-term as well. The site where the liquefaction tank will be installed lies adjacent to Washington Park, which already suffers from high environmental risk and public health problems due to its proximity to existing facilities, Berard said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Fields Point site already has a high risk of storm surges, Berard said. “If climate change were to worsen, the probability of something that would trigger some sort of explosion becomes higher and higher.” He added that if this were to happen, Washington Park is within blast radius.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Graves said that the plant is not likely to explode as the process involves cooling, not heating, natural gas until it reaches its liquid form. Graves said that much of the opposition to the liquefaction facility is “ill-informed (and) ill-advised.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Berard added that the National Grid facility will be situated near another site that handles volatile chemicals, so the possibility for an accident still exists.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Following the legalization of marijuana in nearby Massachusetts, Rhode Island lawmakers have proposed the Cannabis Regulation, Control and Taxation Act<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— a bill legalizing recreational cannabis use for those age 21 and over. Though this will be the third year that a bill like this has been introduced to the state assembly, some lawmakers expressed confidence that reforms may pass in the upcoming legislative session.</p>
<p class="p1">State Rep. Scott Slater D-Providence,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>proposed the bill to the state assembly alongside State Sen. Joshua Miller D-Providence. The law would include mandatory product testing and labeling, restriction on advertising, funding to law enforcement, limits on THC quantity per product and mandatory reviews for all sale products. Additionally, the bill would allow for cities and towns to have some control over the operation of marijuana establishments within their jurisdiction by voter approval.</p>
<p class="p2">Most Democrats and a few Republican representatives support the bill, Slater added. While Gov. Gina Raimondo has yet to publicly supported the bill, she has not commented against it either, Slater said. Slater expects that Raimondo will be influenced to endorse the bill if it follows proper regulations and garners support of grassroots groups.</p>
<p class="p2">Jared Moffat ’13, director of Regulate Rhode Island — a coalition of organizations, citizens and community leaders working to support legislation to regulate and tax adult marijuana use — has worked closely with lawmakers in the Rhode Island General Assembly to lobby for cannabis legalization. “On the heels of Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and California, we think this year is a really great opportunity for us to get the bill passed,” Moffat said.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s certainly not a guarantee, but we do have more momentum than we’ve ever had before,” Moffat said.</p>
<p class="p2">Public approval of marijuana is at an all-time high, according to a 2016 public opinion survey conducted by the Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy. The poll showed that a strong majority of Rhode Island voters — 67 percent — favor the state’s current law which allows cannabis use for medicinal purposes. The same study found that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>55 percent of voters support legislation to regulate and tax recreational cannabis use.</p>
<p class="p2">“With Massachusetts right across the border, it makes sense for Rhode Island to get its system running at the same time,” Moffat added.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moffat, former president of Brown’s chapter of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, described student activism as a key element in the process of legislative reform.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moffat said he worked as a student to pass Rhode Island’s marijuana decriminalization bill in 2012, removing criminal penalties for possession of an ounce or less of marijuana. Additionally, he continues to work with current SSDP President Kathryn Duckworth ’19 and other members of the group to campaign for legislation, run events and spread awareness of healthy cannabis use. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Nadir Pearson ’19, a member of SSDP, is going one step further by creating a new club on campus — the Student Marijuana Alliance for Research and Transparency. SMART addresses public distrust of marijuana and in doing so, aims to change policies through community outreach, workshops and hands-on work with people in the industry, Pearson said.</p>
<p class="p2">“There’s this big cloud of fear we are trying to dismantle,” Pearson said. Cannabis legalization could uniquely benefit Ivy League schools like Brown, Pearson said, who advocates for inter-disciplinary research and instruction on cannabis at the university level.</p>
<p class="p2">“Every subject can involve cannabis, from biology to engineering,” Pearson said. “Brown can be a place where we can open up the dialogue.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heading into the third year of his first term, Mayor Jorge Elorza delivered his annual State of the City address Wednesday, making note of the various accomplishments and benchmarks reached during his time in office.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I stand before you today … with the message that we are building for the long term,” Elorza said. “We are changing this narrative and writing a new script together.” One of the most identifiable ways in which that narrative has been altered is the city’s financial landscape, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From the end of the 2015 fiscal year to the end of the 2016 fiscal year, for example, the city went from a $13 million deficit to the strongest flow of income it had seen in years, Elorza said. He added that for the first time since 2011, Providence will have a rainy day fund.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One symptom of these improvements is home sales in the city, which have increased rapidly, including a 24 percent increase in single family home sales, Elorza said. Thanking the governor for her cooperation in attracting businesses to the city, Elorza lauded the new locations of several companies like General Electric and Johnson &amp; Johnson as signs of Providence’s growth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The mayor intends to build on these developments and has submitted a five-year capital improvement plan worth an estimated $120 million to the City Plan Commission. Speaking on the importance of maintaining the city’s roads, bridges and sewers, Elorza maintained that “we can afford these investments. We can’t afford not to make them.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A large portion of the address was related to educational reforms undertaken by the Elorza administration, including last year’s $2 million investment in 8,000 laptops for city students. Elorza said that $10 million would be spent to make repairs to school district buildings, a component of a recent announcement that the city would increase its contribution to schools for the first time in six years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This will factor into Elorza’s larger stated goal of “(creating) the greatest urban educational district in the country.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another likely factor in improving educational outcomes is an expansion of the city’s contribution to childcare for its residents. In expanding the number and quality of city recreational centers, Elorza has seen the number of meals served in those centers increase from 3,000 in 2015 to 100,000 in 2016. “No child should ever experience hunger, and no family should ever be short on food,” Elorza said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Touching on the issue of crime in Providence, Elorza made note of the fact that the 2016 homicide rate was tied for the city’s lowest in 30 years. In addition, there was a 37 percent decline in the number of shootings recorded this year compared to the five-year average. Elorza attributed this decline to community cooperation with police and an overall doubling of crime watch groups in the past two years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elorza spent the final five minutes of his speech addressing a figure with whom he has found himself more and more at odds in recent weeks: President Donald Trump. “It’s important to address the changed landscape in which we all now find ourselves,” Elorza said. “It’s been two weeks since our president was inaugurated, and already we’ve seen attacks on the principles we hold most dear.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elorza, himself a child of immigrants, said he was “deeply proud and personally thankful of how inclusive and welcoming” the city has been both to his own family and to immigrants more broadly. Elorza focused on that openheartedness, imploring city residents to invest themselves in the city and help improve it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We are the change we seek,” Elorza said, quoting former President Barack Obama. “Together, let’s build the one Providence we all know we have the potential to be.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two high school students were assaulted and robbed on the corner of Thayer St. and Angell St.<span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_490027110"><span class="aQJ"> Friday</span></span> afternoon at <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_490027111"><span class="aQJ">1:26 p.m.</span></span>, according to a community-wide email from the Department of Public Safety.

One of the students was robbed of their cellphone by a group of unidentified young men wearing sweatshirts, according to the crime alert. The young men then ran down Angell St., in the direction of downtown Providence, DPS wrote.

In response to the incident, DPS has upped public safety patrols around the area where the incident occurred and suggests community members visit the department's website for further information on safety awareness.

While the incident is under investigation, individuals with any information are asked to contact University DPS at <a href="tel:(401)%20863-3322" target="_blank">401-863-3322</a> or the Providence Police Department at <a href="tel:(401)%20272-3121" target="_blank">401-272-3121</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One hundred refugees were expected to arrive in Rhode Island by this October, prior to President Donald Trump’s executive order, said Jessica Barry, director of development and communications at Dorcas International Institute of Rhode Island, an agency that helps to resettle refugees. Signed Jan. 27, the order temporarily prohibits entry into the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries. As for the many families hoping to find refuge in Rhode Island — sanctuary remains uncertain. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dorcas, which also uses the acronym DIIRI, is one of the largest refugee resettlement agencies in the state. The agency has resettled an estimated 100 refugees since October 2016, and was expecting at least 100 more before the end of the fiscal year, Barry said. She added that the agency’s services have been impacted as the anticipated arrival of refugees in the Ocean State is no longer guaranteed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though U.S. District Court Judge James Robart halted the enforcement of Trump’s order Feb. 3, it could be reinstated if temporary stays by judges nationwide expire. The announcement of the ban has already disrupted the services of organizations like Dorcas. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We understand that safety and security is an issue, (but) we feel very strongly that there is already tremendous amount of vetting,” especially with immigrants from places like Syria and Iraq, Barry said. “We’re certainly disappointed in the ban.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Each year, DIIRI serves over 450 refugees from around the world, many of whom have traveled from the seven countries affected by Trump’s order, Barry said. DIIRI’s services aim to settle immigrants in the state by aiding many in the citizenship process. Now, the immigration ban has impacted such services as families are barred from entering the state, leaving the future of DIIRI and the refugee population uncertain. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s going to change the pace of how we work (and) the everyday work for our staff members,” Barry said. “A lot of the folks in the refugee population are definitely aware of what’s going on,” she added. “They may require additional services — it’s a tough time.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reacting to Trump’s executive order, the Rhode Island American Civil Liberties Union has filed a number of lawsuits across the nation challenging the immigration ban, said Steven Brown, executive director of the RI ACLU. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Brown, the order raises numerous questions of constitutional concern including “its particular focus on certain Muslim countries and its explicit preference for Christian refugees.” He added that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“these provisions strike us as being totally antithetical to fundamental, constitutional principles.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown hopes the courts will continue to be receptive to the arguments raised by groups like the ACLU. State leaders and city officials across the country, however, have taken it upon themselves to obstruct Trump’s immigration orders on their own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In November, Mayor Jorge Elorza vowed to protect marginalized residents of the state after some <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/11/14/community-members-meet-reject-hate/">expressed concern with Trump’s campaign promises</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the election, Elorza <a href="https://www.providenceri.com/mayor/mayor-elorza-announces-one-providence-initiative">introduced the One Providence Initiative</a>, a series of programs, events and reforms announced in the leadup to Inauguration Day. Elorza has supported the proposed Community Safe Act — a provision of the One Providence initiative — aimed to reform police-community relations. He also created a new Muslim-American advisory board — a group of advisors meant to guide the mayor on policy and issues relating to the Muslim community in Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The mayor’s actions to prevent the Providence Police Department from cooperating with immigration enforcement have not been supported by all. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“He and (Gov. Gina Raimondo), to say they are not going to follow the law in the face of the president of the United States — it’s atrocious,” said William Gorman, executive director of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, a non-profit organization advocating for strong enforcement of immigration laws. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In favor of the executive order, Gorman is critical of city officials like Elorza and hopes the executive order will fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to enforce current immigration laws. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve had these laws since 1986, and no one’s bothered to enforce them, and that’s why we’re in the situation we’re in,” Gorman said. “We’ve been in existence since 2006, shouting from the rooftops to please enforce the current immigration law.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gov. Raimondo proposes two years of free tuition at state colleges</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Gov. Gina Raimondo introduced the Rhode Island’s Promise proposal — which guarantees two years of free college for the state’s students if they choose to attend the Community College of Rhode Island, the University of Rhode Island or Rhode Island College — as a part of her FY2018 budget proposal in a press release Jan. 16.</p>
<p class="p2">“The data shows that in today’s economy, a college degree is the ticket to the middle class,” wrote Deputy Press Secretary Catherine Rolfe in an email to The Herald. “Roughly 70 percent of the jobs we’ll create in the coming years require at least an associate degree,” Rolfe wrote. But less than 45 percent of people in the state have received any higher education degree, according to data from the R.I. Department of Labor and Training.</p>
<p class="p2">“Low-income students spend nearly 75 percent of their family’s income to cover the cost of college,” according to a press release from the governor’s office. Almost 75 percent of R.I. students take on debt to earn a degree, and average debt adds to more than $35,000 after graduation — the second highest reported in the country.</p>
<p class="p2">The cost of the R.I.’s Promise proposal would be $30 million, which constitutes less than 0.5 percent of the state’s budget according to the R.I.’s Promise proposal website. All high school seniors who graduate from public, private or home school or get a GED, starting with the class of 2017, are eligible according to Raimondo’s proposal.</p>
<p class="p2">“(The governor’s) proposal to provide tuition and fees helps make college affordability more of a reality (and) would help ultimately reduce student debt levels and … increase completion rates,” said Andrew Bramson, president and CEO of The College Crusade of Rhode Island. “More state money to support higher education scholarships is really both needed and overdue,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When you put out a proposal like free tuition, it’s clearly going to catch the attention of first-generation and low-income families and students,” Bramson said. He added that College Crusade expects more students to pursue four-year over two-year institutions, considering that tuition over four years will now be cut in half. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How Raimondo’s proposal contributes to completion “is more of an open question,” Bramson said. The proposal does not cover living expenses, which Bramson said “is what’s really determining whether or not low-income and first-generation students can finish college.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The cost of tuition is not the only barrier preventing high school students from continuing on to college, said John Friedman, professor of economics and international and public affairs. “There’s evidence that small barriers to applying or applying for financial aid have really important effects in keeping kids out of college” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to the R.I.’s Promise proposal, the governor has implemented several measures to lower the costs of attending college, including making the PSAT and SAT free for every tenth and eleventh grade student, as well as introducing the Open Textbook Initiative, which lowers the cost of textbooks, Rolfe wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though there are several barriers to attending higher education, programs that “cut cost for attendance at these colleges do seem to have an effect on increasing college attendance rates,” Friedman said. “If you knock the price of attendance down by $1,000,” it increases enrollment in colleges by four to five percent, he added. Friedman also noted that though community college in Rhode Island is not very expensive after federal grants, tax credits and other loans, having a policy that guarantees free tuition greatly simplifies the process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The governor expects that once fully enacted, enrollment at URI, RIC and CCRI could increase by as much as 20 percent, Rolfe wrote. More than 7,000 students per year would be affected, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the fact that the policy will only allow enrollment at state colleges may be a drawback. “Anytime you’re restricting peoples’ choices, that tends to not lead to better outcomes,” Friedman said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friedman referenced one side effect of a similar policy in Massachusetts, where students who performed well enough on high school graduation exams were offered free tuition to the University of Massachusetts. The impact was that students who would have attended other institutions, typically private schools, instead went to UMass, which “led to a lower graduation rate because … kids don’t graduate from UMass at as high a rate as they graduate from other schools,” Friedman said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A tax credit for prospective R.I. college students that would make attending CCRI free but still leave open the option to go to other institutions would be a better option, he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the wake of President Donald Trump’s announcement that he would resume construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, indigenous organizers, tribal leaders and Providence community members protested the controversial pipeline in front of Citizens Bank Wednesday Feb. 8. Demonstrators argued that the DAPL would threaten area access to clean water, violate Native American tribes’ — specifically the Sioux tribe’s — treaty rights by unfairly impinging on tribal land and cultivating corporate greed at the expense of civilian welfare.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The protest was organized the day of an announcement that the Army Corps of Engineers would grant the final permission necessary to begin legal construction of the pipeline, which it approved Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trump’s revival of the pipeline does not come as a surprise. As early as December, he said that he supported completing the pipeline, which spans four states and may carry as many as 550,000 barrels of oil per day to Illinois from its starting point in North Dakota.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trump owned stock in the company constructing the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, according to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/keystone-dakota-pipeline-trump.html">article</a> published in the New York Times. Though a Trump spokesman<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>announced last month that he had sold all of his stock in June, Trump has not provided documentation confirming the completion of the sale.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Protesters gathered at Citizens Bank, which has a revolving loan and an open line of credit in place with the company constructing the DAPL, said Nick Katkevich, one of the protest’s organizers and co-founder of the Fighting Against Natural Gas Collective. Organizers had attempted to meet with bank representatives earlier that day but were escorted out of the building by police, Katkevich said. He encouraged the public to withdraw their deposits from the bank to pressure Citizens to listen to public concerns. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Julz Rich, who demonstrated at Standing Rock in 2016 and was the first woman to chain herself to a construction vehicle there, spoke to the crowd about the intergenerational nature of the issue. The land on which the DAPL would be constructed has belonged to native people for hundreds of years and construction on it would violate a collective history, Rich said. She added that the DAPL threatens future generations of Native Americans who deserve clean water.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DAPL construction stalled during the final weeks of the Obama administration, with the USACE blocking construction Dec. 4. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “This a big gesture of (the Trump administration) not caring about the future,” said protestor Edward Foster. Desire to protect the environment and secure clean drinking water in the United States motivated him to join the protest, he said, as well as his opposition to the emerging policies of the Trump administration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the protest continued, police officers approached the protesters and asked them to move to a different spot in front of the bank.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“How’re you going to ban someone on land you stole? This bank doesn’t own this land. Those cops over there don’t own this land,” Rich said. Other speakers referenced more examples of stolen lands, emphasizing that the phenomenon is not limited to DAPL construction. The city of Providence itself rests on land that rightfully belongs to native tribes, multiple speakers said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While protesters and speakers expressed fear at the Trump administration’s recently announced policies, one female protester expressed hope at the level of political engagement she has seen in recent weeks: “I’ve never been so blown away to see the power in the people.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Severe weather conditions did not stop hundreds from gathering at Sunday’s town hall meeting at East Providence High School. Rhode Islanders gathered to discuss ongoing issues affecting the Ocean State with Democratic R.I. Congressmen Sen. Jack Reed, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin and U.S. Rep. David Cicilline ’83. Holding signs displaying “Persist!” and “Stay Human,” crowd members were quick to demand answers from their elected officials. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The town hall meeting centered around the fate of the Affordable Care Act, protecting the environment, increasing the minimum wage and organizing movements to resist President Donald Trump’s executive orders on legal grounds.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From the start, the crowd voiced frustration with the state’s political leaders. Reed, while testing out the microphone, asked the audience if he was loud enough to be heard — “you need to be louder in Washington too,” one protester shouted in response.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sharing the crowd’s tone of frustration, Langevin encouraged community engagement and vowed to represent R.I. voters. “We’re upset, we’re angry at where the president is trying to lead our country and we’re not just going to sit back and take it,” Langevin said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One audience member urged lawmakers to make Rhode Island a leader of the wind-power industry while also expressing concern about fracking and climate change. Though Whitehouse committed to fight climate change, he declined to place any political pressure on the deciding committee on fracking and said he supported infrastructure expansion. Additionally, Whitehouse said he had not made a decision regarding former Sen. Dan Coats’ nomination as Director of National Intelligence, resulting in an uproar from the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Just say no!” the audience chanted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A son and grandson of refugees who fled Nazi Germany, one audience member asked the officials to demand the president’s resignation and the appointment of a Democrat as vice president. The room erupted in applause. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Citing the 25th Amendment as a precedent — when Nelson Rockefeller filled the position as vice president following the 1964 resignation of former President Richard Nixon — the voter went on to plead for government unity. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reed rejected such a proposal based on constitutionality. “Yes, he has to go, but we have to recognize, ultimately we are serving the constitution,” Reed said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whitehouse also encouraged legal and constitutional methods of resistance, primarily stating the Democratic Party’s focus on the 2018 election. “Short of impeachment, the real way to rebuke this guy is to take back (the U.S. House of Representatives) in a flood,” Whitehouse said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given U.S. District Court Judge James Robart’s halt on the enforcement of Trump’s order Feb. 3, Cicilline noted the importance of the judiciary in limiting the president’s power. Trump’s remarks of “fake news” and “so-called judge” at Robart’s expense are Trump’s ways of attempting to delegitimize the two institutions that hold him accountable, Cicilline said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following the town hall meeting, some audience members said they felt more assured of the progress being made in Washington.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I feel better being here but it’s not necessarily (because of) what my democratically elected leaders have said — it’s seeing the energy in the crowd,” said audience member Mandy Jordan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article mislabeled U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin and U.S. Rep. David Cicilline '83 as state representatives. In fact, they are U.S. representatives. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>R.I. lawmakers reintroduce law to protect abortion rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Fearing an overturn of the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade by a Supreme Court slated to lean conservative, Rhode Island lawmakers have reintroduced the Reproductive Health Care Act to protect the right to have an abortion in the state. The bill is identical to legislation introduced last year, said Rep. Edith Ajello D-Providence, who reintroduced the act to the R.I. House of Representatives Feb. 2.</p>
<p class="p2">The previous bill was introduced to the House Judiciary on Feb. 3, 2016 and was ultimately unsuccessful. Similar to its predecessor, the act aims to “prohibit the state from interfering with a woman’s decision to prevent, commence, continue or terminate a pregnancy prior to fetal viability,” according to the legislation. The bill also prohibits any restrictions on the use of medically recognized methods of contraception or abortion.</p>
<p class="p2">The bill is co-sponsored by 33 of the 75 members of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, but no Republicans were willing to sign as co-sponsors of the bill, Ajello said. Though the bill failed to pass last year, Ajello voiced her optimism of its passing this time around given the increase of pro-choice members in the R.I. House.</p>
<p class="p2">“There are six new members of the House who replaced anti-choice representatives, which substantially increases the number of pro-choice members,” Ajello said.</p>
<p class="p2">Monday marked a year since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. With Scalia’s vacancy and the Republican blockade of Merrick Garland’s nomination, the U.S. Supreme Court is currently divided between four conservative and four liberal justices.</p>
<p class="p2">President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch last week, potentially tipping the court in favor of conservatism. At a Green Bay, Wis. town hall meeting Mar. 30, 2016, Trump also added to pro-choice advocates’ fears, saying the government should somehow punish women who have abortions, but he later <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-lewandowski-they-re-destroying-very-good-person-n548036">walked back</a> on that comment. With Gorsuch’s nomination and the resulting uncertainty of the court’s ideological makeup, reproductive rights in Rhode Island are threatened, Ajello said.</p>
<p class="p2">If Roe v. Wade is overturned, some R.I. laws nulled by the Supreme Court decision could come back into play, Ajello said, including a law that requires spousal notification prior to abortion.</p>
<p class="p2">“A woman has to inform her husband, and the doctor needs to have proof that the husband is aware that the abortion is to take place,” Ajello said.</p>
<p class="p2">Laws like this aren’t all that’s restricting access to abortion. Because of poor access to abortion clinics and womens’ health resources, Rhode Island was awarded an F in reproductive freedom by NARAL Pro-Choice America — a national reproductive rights advocacy <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/11/rhode-island-fails-to-guarantee-abortion-access-affordability/">group</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Gopika Krishna ’13 MD’17, a board member of Medical Students for Choice, said that students and community members should get involved in coalitions and organizations to protect reproductive rights — particularly for those most vulnerable in light of a possible overturn.</p>
<p class="p2">Under current Rhode Island constitutional law, the right to have an abortion would not be guaranteed in the event Roe v. Wade is overturned, Krishna said, adding that women would have to travel to states like New York or Vermont in order to have access to such procedures like abortion. Those with limited financial means and time would be the most at risk, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">“Our laws are ambiguous on the subject — we want to make sure that we’re in a place where we don’t have to be concerned that people would lose access to reproductive health care and abortion,” said Craig O’Connor, R.I. Director of Public Policy and Government Relations with Planned Parenthood of Southern New England.</p>
<p class="p2">Though O’Connor does not anticipate an overturn of the Supreme Court ruling, he voiced his strong support of the Reproductive Health Care Act and continues to work with lawmakers like Ajello to protect reproductive rights.</p>
<p class="p2">“At this point, overturning Roe v. Wade is a distant possibility; it’s not out of the realm of the unthinkable, but we want to make it clear and keep things the way they are currently under Roe v. Wade,” O’Connor said.</p>
<p class="p2">O’Connor said he expects Ajello’s bill to be introduced to the Senate in the coming days.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mayor Jorge Elorza held a meeting to discuss the development of Kennedy Plaza, the city’s main center, at the Department of Planning and Development Thursday. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “This is a historic moment for Kennedy Plaza,” Elorza said, noting that a final undeveloped parcel of land in the city center will soon be completed. A “citywide discussion” on the issue, the event offered citizens of all perspectives and backgrounds to propose their own ideas for the plaza — from transforming the plaza into a European-style open-air market to tearing down the historic terminal building to facilitate the creation of an elaborate water feature.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Elorza spoke to the current amorphousness of Kennedy Plaza’s future and asked attendees to share their own visions for what that space will ultimately look like.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Since the beginning of our city, Kennedy Plaza has been the heart of Providence, a hub of civic space,” said Bonnie Nickerson, director of the Providence Department of Planning and Development. Nickerson emphasized her point by showing a slideshow of historical photos and renderings of the city, charting its development as a transportation center.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> But this development has not always been salutary, Nickerson said, drawing attention to the 1960s and 70s when the plaza began to “deteriorate.” This image of a city space in decline has been invoked times over as an argument for a drastic reimagining of Kennedy Plaza and its role in the city. While there has been some consensus on a need for change, the nature of that transformation has yet to be determined — something made clear by the meeting’s facilitators.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Nickerson presented a number of possible options for development of the plaza. One plan would see Kennedy Plaza and Burnside park joined to form a contiguous space, while another proposed a diversion of traffic directly through Burnside. Another entailed a relocation of some bus activity from Fulton Street to Exchange Terrace to relieve the flow of traffic at the perimeter of the plaza.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Even though the final direction must still be mapped out, Nickerson said some of the plaza’s future attributes have already been decided — for example, that the number of bus berths will be lowered to three or four in each direction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Additionally, a multi-purpose transit center at the Amtrak station will reach completion in the next three and a half years, Nickerson said. The finalized center would involve a movement of some bus services to the train station. The city is also <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/16/plaza-proposal-marred-protest-exclusion/">repurposing</a> a grant for streetcar funding to finance a transit connector between Providence Station and the hospital district, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Following the presentation, multiple groups broke out to discuss options for and concerns about the plaza’s direction. As people abandoned their seats to pour over details and stencil features onto blank maps of the plaza, one woman sat alone, holding above her head a sign that read “Keep the bus where the people are, SAVE Kennedy Plaza.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I am a citizen who uses the bus service at Kennedy Plaza on the regular,” said Deborah Wray, president of Direct Action for Rights and Equality, a community service and advocacy organization. “I am worried because nobody here is dealing with the concerns of the average person.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Barbara Freitas, director of the Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project, said she also attended the meeting to represent the worries of those who stand to lose the most in the event of Kennedy Plaza’s redevelopment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m more concerned now than ever before that this is really going to impact the homeless,” Freitas said. Any relocation of transit from Kennedy Plaza could also affect the location of Providence’s homeless population, possibly impacting the work of advocates trying to service the city’s displaced persons. “If they keep getting pushed away, it’s going to be harder and harder for us to reach them,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Freitas pinned a great deal of blame on Former Mayor of Providence Joe Paolino Jr. P ’17, now a managing partner of Providence-based Paolino Properties and board chairman of the Downtown Improvement District. Even while out of office, Paolino has been central to debate over the plaza, and his plans for its development have drawn <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/16/plaza-proposal-marred-protest-exclusion/">attention</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I don’t call it Kennedy Plaza anymore because I think he’s the one running the show,” Freitas said. “Now I call it Paolino Plaza.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Paolino’s “priorities are not totally aligned with the vast majority of users,” said Sam Rubinstein ’17. Rubinstein also made note of Paolino’s support for stricter panhandling laws — which some argue could disproportionately impact homeless panhandlers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Rubinstein came to the event as part of Visiting Associate Professor Robert Azar’s class, URBN 1870T: “Transportation: An Urban Planning Perspective.” He explained that Azar, who also serves as assistant city planner, brought the class to the event to contextualize material from the course.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Aaron Zhang ’17 also came to the event as part of Azar’s class. “We learned about how with city planning there’s just a lot of politics,” he said. “We definitely felt that today.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nickerson said that, in the end, all were working toward a common aim.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our overall goal is to ensure that Kennedy Plaza is an active, vibrant, safe and attractive city center,” Nickerson said. “It’s hard to disagree with that goal.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Indivisible RI seeks to obstruct Trump agenda</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2009, the inauguration of former President Barack Obama provoked the creation of the conservative Tea Party movement as a vehicle of organized resistance. In the wake of President Trump’s electoral victory, progressives across the country are seeking to create something of a new Tea Party in the grassroot movement known as Indivisible. Its mission is simple— stop the Trump agenda.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Former congressional staffers wrote the Indivisible guide — the movement’s written platform — using Tea Party strategies to resist Trump, said Andy Acciaioli, founder of Indivisible RI. By Jan. 4, only weeks after the election, the national movement had grown to 350 constituent groups, he added. Currently, Indivisible comprises over 7,000 groups nationwide.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In its five weeks of existence, Indivisible RI already has five groups in the state and an estimated 3,700 “supporters,” Acciaioli said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We don’t get involved in issues — though there are many that we hold near and dear to our hearts. The most important thing is to stop the Trump agenda,” Acciaioli said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The success of the Tea Party movement demonstrated the power of constituent influence on congressmen, Acciaioli said, stressing the significance of community interaction in the Ocean state. He added that the same zeal that propelled the Tea Party to prominence in 2009 will be repurposed to resist the Trump administration. Resistance takes two key forms: making daily calls to senators and visiting local offices, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indivisible RI hosted an information event Feb. 16 where dozens of activists, students and residents joined to voice their frustration and concern.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Invoking the years of the Bush administration, audience member Philip Graham said Democrats should abstain from cooperating with the Trump agenda. “My worry is that we make sure there are no Democratic votes, no fingerprints on any of the terrible stuff that’s coming.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Organizers encouraged members to make phone calls, visit congressmen’s offices and press elected officials at town hall meetings. At one point in the meeting, they incorporated role-playing and practiced phone calls to prepare audience members.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jane Tucker, an organizer of Indivisible RI, said the organization should focus on holding Democratic leaders accountable, even in a majority blue state like Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Some people say to me, ‘But our members of congress are Democrats, they’re on our side,’” Tucker said. But he noted that recent votes in cabinet confirmation hearings prove the opposite. Sen. Jack Reed D-R.I. and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D-R.I. both <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/01/29/sen-whitehouse-addresses-controversial-vote/">voted to confirm</a> Trump’s Director of Central Intelligence Agency nominee, Mike Pompeo, for example.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Congressmen are more likely to notice acts that take up constituents’ time, Tucker said. Though small-scale actions such as petitions are effective, Tucker said, they do not compare to the impact of an office visit. “For every call, there are 10 people not calling. My showing up counts for 100 people,” said one audience member.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In a state like ours, our actions are to embolden our members of Congress, to (make them) the advocates we want them to be,” Tucker said. “We want them to get out on the senate floor whenever they can. We want them loud, we want them angry.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tucker noted Indivisible RI’s influence on the congressmen given Sen. Whitehouse’s distinct change in behavior and actions over the last few months. After. Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Ma was barred from speaking on the senate floor during the vote for attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions R-Al, Sen. Whitehouse attempted to enter Coretta Scott King’s letter into the congressional record. Though he failed, some Indivisible RI members felt encouraged by Whitehouse’s act.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I see people come in with their heads down, they feel there is no hope,” Acciaioli said. “By the end of the meeting, they see the simplicity of the system and suddenly, that gives them hope.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b>Thousands rallied for gun control at the State House last Sunday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Three thousand Rhode Islanders bore posters, megaphones and palpable determination as they assembled to stand behind the survivors of the Parkland, Florida shooting and demand gun control March 24 at the State House. The rally, one of more than 800 “March for Our Lives” protests worldwide, featured speakers including Gov. Gina Raimondo, David Cicilline ’83, D-R.I., Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D-R.I., Mayor Jorge Elorza, State Rep. Aaron Regunberg ’12 D-Providence and student activists, The Herald previously <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/25/rallying-gun-control-thousands-gather-march-lives-state-house/">reported</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Rhode Island joined campaign against census question on citizenship Tuesday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhode Island has joined a multi-state lawsuit to “preserve a fair and accurate census,” announced Attorney General Peter Kilmartin <a href="http://www.ri.gov/press/view/32828">Tuesday</a>. The announcement comes in response to the federal government’s decision to include a question about citizenship on the 2020 Census — the first time since 1950 that respondents will have to indicate whether or not they are citizens of the United States. “It is critical for every person — regardless of their citizenship status — be counted in order to preserve the level of representation the State has in Washington, D.C.,” Kilmartin said, adding that the census’ purpose “is not to determine an individual’s citizenship status. In fact, asking the question will only serve to discourage individuals from responding.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Oldest tree kangaroo in the United States died at Roger Williams Park Zoo Tuesday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The kangaroo, “Paul,” lived for 23 years, five months and five days before passing away due to complications from heart issues that reduced his quality of life, Roger Williams Park Zoo &amp; Carousel Village announced <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RWPZoo/photos/a.385169421607.165014.279994236607/10155594545681608/?type=3&amp;theater">Wednesday</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His species, Matschie’s tree kangaroos, is native to Papua New Guinea and there are only about 2,500 to 3,000 left in the wild. The life expectancy for the species is less than 15 years, the zoo said. “It is a great testament to the love and care Paul received from his keepers and veterinary staff that he lived such a long life,” said Roger Williams Park Zoo executive director Jeremy Goodman in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Anti-vaccine advocates demanded a repeal of state’s vaccine mandates Wednesday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Opponents of Rhode Island’s mandatory vaccine policies showed up at the State House Wednesday in support of a legislative package that would allow parents to refuse vaccines for their children, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180328/battle-reignites-over-vaccinating-ri-school-children">reported</a>. Rhode Island currently requires a <a href="http://health.ri.gov/immunization/for/schools/">list</a> of vaccinations for pre-kindergarten and grade school children, but the proposed legislation would allow parents to opt out if the immunization is for “a non-causal contact disease transmitted by sexual contact between <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText18/HouseText18/H7576.pdf">individuals</a>” or for “personal, philosophical or religious <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText18/HouseText18/H7686.pdf">beliefs</a>.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Rhode Island school improvement plan approved Thursday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos approved Rhode Island’s school improvement plan Thursday, which increases state agency over academic standards, accountability and use of federal education funds, among other measures, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180330/us-secretary-of-education-approves-ri-school-improvement-plan">reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The improvement plan, approved under the Every Student Succeeds Act, includes an initiative to put computer science courses in every school in the state by 2025, personalized learning pathways and plans to involve teachers in statewide decision-making.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>After back-and-forth, WaterFire Arts Center displayed house honoring Rosa Parks Saturday, Sunday</b></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University announced that it canceled the planned exhibition of a house that belonged to Rosa Parks’ brother over a “dispute” independent from the University March 8, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/15/rosa-parks-exhibition-canceled/">reported</a>. But the WaterFire Arts Center displayed the house March 31 and April 1. The future of the house is still unknown.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Providence City Council has taken a step into national politics: They will consider an ordinance amendment that would limit the city’s funding of projects or entities associated with the finance of the Dakota Access Pipeline.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Introduced at a council meeting Feb. 16, the ordinance would prohibit the city from contracting with organizations found to finance the pipeline and would specifically terminate the city’s contract with Citizens Bank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The bank holds a revolving loan and open line of credit to Sunoco Logistics Partners, one of the pipeline’s backers, and the company has been criticized by some over the past year as interactions between state police and protestors at Standing Rock, North Dakota have escalated.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to some sources, Citizens Bank is contributing $72.5 million to the project — which would involve laying 1,200 miles of pipeline between North Dakota to Illinois — through investments in Sunoco.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In response to the Army Corps of Engineers’ decision to reapprove legal construction of the pipeline Feb. 8, protestors gathered in front of Citizens Bank downtown and decried the decision, which demonstrators said could threaten drinking water and environmental safety, The Herald previously reported.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Councilman Seth Yurdin introduced the ordinance and said opposition to the project by indigenous groups and environmental organizations warrants the city’s divestment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Now more than ever it’s up to local and state governments” to address issues like the DAPL, Yurdin added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many stakeholders present for the council meeting expressed optimism at the ordinance’s potential and cited the successes of similar measures recently approved in Seattle, Wash. and Davis, Calif.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I came (to the council meeting) because I want to see our city take a leadership role in divesting from these banks,” said Crow Grando, a person of partially indigenous heritage. “After Seattle divested from Wells Fargo, a lot of people started thinking about their city’s role in this project.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Justin Roias of Providence said showing support for the ordinance was a way of connecting to an issue taking place hundreds of miles away. “We can’t occupy those spaces physically, but we can come here and show our support.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a Jan. 30 letter to company stakeholders, Citizens Bank outlined their position on the issue and said it was “very concerned about the situation on the ground in North Dakota.” It added that the company had been in contact with representatives and stakeholders from tribal communities as well as human rights and non-governmental organizations in relation to protests at Standing Rock.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We understand that many stakeholders believe that banks should withdraw the project loan,” the statement read, “however, we have signed a contract … and cannot terminate this contract unilaterally.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Citizen’s Bank does not comment publicly on its clients and declined to comment for this story.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Citywide conversation tackles race, environment in Providence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Community organizers and residents gathered Monday evening in the basement of Bell Street Chapel on Federal Hill to launch a discussion on the role race and racism play in the environmental challenges that Providence faces today. While environmental justice is often thought of as an abstract, large-scale issue, it is important to also think about it in terms of personal stories and narratives said Michael Araujo, executive director of Rhode Island Jobs with Justice, a Providence-based group focused on advocating for workers rights. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After taking his daughter to the doctor for a checkup, Araujo learned she had high levels of lead in her blood. He later discovered this was because of the high lead count in the soil in his backyard. “I realized that I was raising my daughter in a place where we can’t touch the soil,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The city of Providence, through its Racial and Environmental Justice Committee, is aiming to look at sustainability through a lens of racial equality, said Leah Bamburger, who works in the Office of Sustainability for the city. This meeting was an opportunity to establish a base with community members and bring their concerns back to the committee, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Araujo encouraged 40-plus attendees to break up into small groups to discuss their main environmental concerns. Upon reconvening, Araujo cold-called on each member of the audience to summarize the concerns they had discussed, adding that their participation was vital to bringing the nuances of environmental injustice in Providence to light.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The list of grievances includes concerns about the low quality of Providence drinking water — it is among the worst in the country in terms of lead contamination — as well as dumping of trash in vacant lots across Providence, lack of access to green spaces and the disposal of liquefied natural gas in South Providence. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Environmental injustice in communities of color should be brought to light, said Asata Tigrai, a community organizer in Providence. In many communities of color, residents move into homes without realizing that the ground, structure or water are contaminated with lead, she said, adding that these conditions are not being adequately addressed by Providence policy-makers. Tigrai has worked to push back against the city constructing public housing projects and schools on former dumps, arguing that these are contaminated and as such threaten the safety of schoolchildren, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many attendees brought up the environmental privilege enjoyed on the East Side, which is apparent through the amount of greenery and public parks that are harder to find in other parts of the city. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Much of the discussion centered around the idea of privilege: “I can’t help but think about these things in terms of white supremacy,” Araujo said, adding that while Providence has one of the oldest black populations in the United States, 75 percent of that population has been forcibly displaced into different parts of the city since the 1960s. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Another attendee noted that the construction projects the city takes on do not always benefit the communities they directly impact: A highway construction project currently runs through the middle of Olneyville despite the fact that the community has one of the lowest rates of car ownership in the city, he said, adding that this construction project “won’t benefit (Olneyville) in any way.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some students attended the event — one noted to the group that he feels Brown exists in a bubble of environmental privilege.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Colin Kent-Daggett ’19, another attendee, said he had attended because he wanted to be more involved in the Providence community beyond Brown. “I think we all need to be careful about how and when we go into the Providence community” because Brown students often lack the expertise on the specific issues affecting individuals those communities.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Araujo was impressed with the level of turnout at the meeting, noting he had only expected a handful of people. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Political vitality has been potent in Providence and across the nation since the election of President Trump, Tigrai said. “It’s bringing us all together … never before in the last 30 or 40 years have we come together” to this degree, she said. But in order for these conversations to effect real change, people need to challenge the systems of power that exist in the United States today, Tigrai added. “We can change our hearts and our minds, but we have to use our hearts and our minds to change the system of economics” that disproportionately affects communities of color, she said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Paul Ryan’s RI visit on youth education programs elicits protests</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">“Stop your lying, lyin’ Ryan!” chanted hundreds of protesters as they greeted the U. S. Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, R-Wis, during his visit Thursday to the Ocean State. Ryan’s visit, which centered on a meeting with Year Up — an organization committed to training low-income young adults — focused on how Congress and cities like Providence can empower young adults to succeed in professional careers and higher education, according to a statement released to NBC 10.</p>
<p class="p4">In response to Ryan’s visit, State Rep. Aaron Regunberg ’12, D-Providence, organized a protest outside of Ryan’s meeting with Year Up. “The focus of this event is for folks to send a clear message to Paul Ryan that (President Trump’s) agenda is not welcomed here in Rhode Island,” Regunberg said. “He’s going to face resistance wherever he goes.”</p>
<p class="p4">Because police reportedly expected a large turnout ahead of time, officers cordoned off the sidewalk around 40 Fountain St. to keep protesters at a distance. Ryan avoided the crowds and proceeded to enter the building through the back entry. “Coward!” protesters yelled in response.</p>
<p class="p4">Many protesters raised concerns over the Affordable Care Act, immigration reform and Ryan’s reluctance to meet with local constituents in his district, even as several other Republicans have rallied to do so in their own districts.</p>
<p class="p4">“He’s refused to hold any town hall meetings in his district in Wisconsin,” Regunberg said. “No matter where he goes or where he runs or hides — the resistance to this agenda is going to follow him.”</p>
<p class="p4">Marina Dimitrijevic, executive director of the Wisconsin Working Families Party, voiced her support for the Rhode Island protest to The Herald from her home state. “We’ve asked him in Jamesville to have a town hall meeting and nothing is ever scheduled,” Dimitrijevic said. “He’s working on his health care plans to change Medicare, Medicaid and affordable health care, and he refuses to speak directly to his constituents.”</p>
<p class="p4">Dimitrijevic added that over 80,000 postcards were sent to Ryan’s district office, and that his staff did not accept them. “He’s leaving Wisconsin — he can’t escape us, and we’re just getting started,” Dimitrijevic said.</p>
<p class="p4">Regunberg took the House Speaker’s actions as direct threats to Rhode Island principles. “The values that Rhode Island was founded on — religious tolerance, democracy and justice — those are values that face bigger threats from the Trump/Ryan agenda,” Regunberg said. “It’s important that people get involved.”</p>
<p class="p4">Though hundreds chanted and marched in defiance of Ryan’s visit, not all Rhode Islanders were supportive of the protest. Austin Rose ’19, treasurer of Brown’s College Republicans, said the protest was ineffective due to the fundamental differences between views held by Ryan and those by President Trump on topics ranging from tax policy to health care reform.</p>
<p class="p4">“Anybody who went out (to the protest) with the intention of getting back at Republicans does a lot of damage,” Rose said.</p>
<p class="p4">“To say ‘Because Trump is elected, now there’s no one left with a rational policy voice on the conservative side’ paints everyone with a bad brush, limits bipartisanship and limits the potential to have middle ground,” he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An ethanol train ran off its tracks around 1 a.m. Wednesday in the south side of Providence. The train crashed through a chain-link fence and into a multi-lane road, but no ethanol spilled as a result of the incident, the Providence Journal reported.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In response to the derailment, some local environmental activists are calling for an end to ethanol transport through Providence. Ethanol is “explosive and extremely flammable,” according to a joint-press release from the Fight Against Natural Gas collective, Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island, the Sierra Club and No LNG in PVD. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “It is not okay that south side Providence is the sacrifice zone for these toxic and dangerous industries,” said Monica Huertes, a member of No LNG in PVD and resident of South Providence, in a quote included in the press release.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The press release dubbed ethanol trains “bomb trains” and called on Providence to ban ethanol transport through the city, just as Boston did in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Boston banned licensing of ethanol-carrying vehicles through its boroughs in its 2015 budget, the ban expired in January 2017. Subsequent budgets did not extend the ban.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Two days after the Providence crash, an ethanol train ran off its tracks in Iowa. The crash caused a fire that continued for 15 hours, the Associated Press reported. In a 2015 report, the Department of Transportation predicted oil and ethanol trains would derail about 10 times per year in the coming two decades, the Associated Press reported.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rhode Island bill seeks to limit conversion therapy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">Conversion therapy, the controversial treatment concerned with the deliberate alteration of one’s sexual orientation or gender identity, has come under fire in the State Assembly of Rhode Island, where it is still a legal practice. To limit practice of the therapy, Rhode Island lawmakers<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>introduced the Prevention of Conversion Therapy for Children Act Jan. 27. If passed, the bill would prohibit licensed medical practitioners from practicing conversion therapy on minors in the Ocean State.</p>
<p class="p4">The GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders — a Boston-based legal group that advocates for sexual orientation, gender identification and HIV status issues — has been involved with the R.I. bill as well as several others nationwide, said GLAD Senior Attorney Patience Crozier. The group has advocated for LGBTQ issues around the entire New England area and offered testimony during the Rhode Island House hearing, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“Conversion therapy is essentially based on the false claim that being LGBT is a mental illness that needs to be cured,” Crozier said.</p>
<p class="p4">State Rep. Joseph McNamara, D-Warwick — one of the bill’s co-sponsors — said GLAD’s testimony revealed the “barbaric” nature of the practice.</p>
<p class="p4">State Rep. Moira Walsh, D-Providence, another co-sponsor, noted that more than 80 people were present to testify in favor of the bill during the committee hearing, while only one testified against.</p>
<p class="p4">The sole testimony in opposition came from a man who said he had gone through reparative therapy himself with other adults in his church. “Change toward a healthy and holy lifestyle that honors God is possible,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">“Reparative therapy works and Rhode Island professionals should not be prevented from offering it, especially to concerned parents and their children,” the man who testified said. He added that studies claiming to show negative impacts associated with conversion therapy cannot be taken seriously as they don’t control for all possible variables.</p>
<p class="p4">“Witnessing the emotional toll that (conversion therapy) takes on people is enough in of itself for me, as a representative, to say I’m going to do whatever I can to make sure this isn’t something that kids in my community are subjected to,” Walsh said.</p>
<p class="p4">Walsh added many have ignored the practice as licensed practitioners are no longer using controversial, “old fashion methods” such as electroshock therapy in conversion. By sponsoring the bill, Walsh hopes to highlight the consequences often faced by those who undergo conversion therapy.</p>
<p class="p4">“Kids who are subjected to this kind of treatment are statistically more likely to commit suicide, suffer from depression and have really debilitating issues when coming to terms with their sexuality, which is not a particularly easy thing to do in the first place,” Walsh said.</p>
<p class="p4">Though Walsh aims to prevent Rhode Island’s youth from experiencing conversion therapy, she said lawmakers are inevitably limited to do so based on religious freedom.</p>
<p class="p4">“Unfortunately, this bill is specific to licensed medical practitioners, which does not solve the problem of church-coordinated, conversion therapy situations,” Walsh said. “This really does nothing for the religious end of it — you can’t really tell a parent what to do with their child.”</p>
<p class="p4">If passed, the bill would make Rhode Island something of an exception in the fight against the practice: Conversion therapy as a treatment for minors is currently banned in only five states and the District of Columbia — the only New England state to pass a bill limiting the practice is Vermont, which banned conversion therapy last year.</p>
<p class="p4">Despite public support, Walsh is uncertain of the bill’s passing. The future of the Act will depend on the position of the Speaker of the House — State Rep. Nicholas Mattiello, D-Cranston — as well as other representatives who could refrain from signing on, Walsh said.</p>
<p class="p4">Mattiello’s position on the issue is unclear. While he reversed his previous opposition to gay marriage in 2013, he has not been shy in straying from his party on issues like abortion and gun rights, RI Monthly previously reported .</p>
<p class="p4">“Unfortunately, sometimes it doesn’t matter how good the bill is or how much support it has, it really is not in your hands,” Walsh said. “We are limited in the ways that we can assist but, by drawing attention to the fact that this is still an ongoing practice — that does a measurable good in and of itself.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>East Side bookstore to leave Wayland Square</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For 21 years, Kristin Sollenberger has owned and operated Paper Nautilus, a secondhand bookstore at 5 South Angell St. On March 6, she received a letter from landlord Kenneth Dulgarian stating that Paper Nautilus’ lease will expire April 15 and is not up for renewal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dulgarian did not disclose the reasons for not renewing Paper Nautilus’ lease. The Providence Journal reported that he had signed a nondisclosure agreement regarding plans for the South Angell Street property, and he could not be reached when contacted for an interview with The Herald. Dulgarian owns several other properties in Wayland Square and Thayer Street, including the Avon Cinema and the building that houses Starbucks and Santander Bank.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Over the 21 years she has occupied the space, Sollenberger said she never had any problems renewing her lease. “When I called after receiving the certified letter saying he wasn’t going to renew it, he didn’t have any explanation, and he didn’t ever offer (the space) to me for a higher price,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sollenberger was able to negotiate for an April 30 departure date, but was surprised that Dulgarian had not approached her earlier about the lease, given their relationship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nautilus regular Kate Josephson p</span>osted a petition two weeks ago to save the store with the help of former Brown literary arts professors Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop. The petition currently lists 1,160 signatures and hundreds of comments from supporters across the United States and beyond.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sollenberger noted that the support has encouraged her to find a new location. Since the publication of Paper Nautilus’ story in the Providence Journal Saturday, Sollenberger has been contacted by multiple real estate agents with suggestions for possible relocations. At the moment, she is unsure where Paper Nautilus will relocate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Old bookstores like this one are deeply connected with a community. They help people to grow and share thoughts,” wrote one commenter from Aversa, Italy, on the petition.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“A huge piece of the community would be missing” if Paper Nautilus is unable to find a place to resettle, Josephson said. While Josephson is doubtful the petition will change Dulgarian’s mind, she feels creating it and reading the supportive comments has made the experience “a little less dismal and depressing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sollenberger first came to Providence as a Rhode Island School of Design student in the late ‘80s. She graduated with a painting degree in 1990 and worked at the largest used-book store in Rhode Island, Cellar Stories, before going on to manage the Providence Bookstore Cafe for five years. When the cafe closed in 1996, Sollenberger bought its inventory and opened Paper Nautilus.</span></p>
<p class="p4">The concept of a used-book store intrigued Sollenberger, who was excited to learn that she “could buy a whole pile of books for $20 instead of one book.”</p>
<p class="p4">“I had also been able to indulge my creative side with the store in doing my artwork on the side,” Sollenberger added.</p>
<p class="p4">Sollenberger created Paper Nautilus from the ground up. Friends and family helped her paint walls and build bookcases, and she displays the work of local artists around the shop, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">“There’s a way in which Paper Nautilus feels in itself like a work of art,” Josephson said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Updated on Mar. 22 at 12:57 p.m.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The debate over graduate student unionization at the University starts a new chapter as Stand Up for Graduate Student Employees — the main group pushing for unionization on campus — concluded voting on the labor union with which it will affiliate. The American Federation of Teachers was selected as the affiliated labor union, according to the results of the vote made public Tuesday night, wrote Joseph Skitka GS, a member of SUGSE and its affiliation working group, in a follow-up email to The Herald. All graduate students were eligible to vote between the AFT and the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, both of which would offer resources such as legal advice, access to lawyers and guidance in contract writing, according to Ian Harding GS, a member of SUGSE.</p>
<p class="p2">The AFT and UAW are similar in that they are both “large, international unions, and they both represent tens of thousands of graduate students and student workers across the country,” Skitka said. The two unions have differences, however, which lie in their approach to organizing. In order to form a recognized union of graduate students at the University, a plurality of the bargaining unit — PhD students currently serving in teaching and research assistant roles — must vote in favor of unionization. To secure 51 percent of the vote, a campaign for unionization must take place, which “will affect the whole campus,” Skitka said.</p>
<p class="p2">UAW “believe(s) that a graduate-led, grassroots canvassing structure is the best approach, and it may be a little slower of a process” because it relies more on graduate students being responsible for canvassing, Skitka said. While both unions would send staff members to campus in administrative, supportive and training roles, AFT would also send in staff members as a part of the unionization campaign to walk around campus and talk to students. This approach can move the process along faster, Skitka said.</p>
<p class="p2">AFT offers “a bit more freedom” by allowing “a local union to determine their own bylaws and structure, whereas UAW kind of provides a basic structure and bylaws for us in constitution,” Skitka said. He also pointed out the possibility that UAW would have the graduate student union at the University “join a local union with workers from other industries.”</p>
<p class="p2">Narrowing down to two unions “was a very thorough process where we wanted to exhaustively explore all the options,” Skitka said, adding that “it was really important to us to make students feel like they had the ultimate say in this matter.” SUGSE initially reached out to seven different unions based on which ones had existing relationships with graduate students, and the two ended up being viable options, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">While SUGSE has gained traction on campus, some oppose unionization because a number of graduate students may already feel content with their departments and their positions within them, according to the <a href="http://students.brown.edu/gsc/wp-content/uploads/UnionizationFAQ.pdf">Graduate Student Council FAQ sheet</a> related to unionization. What SUGSE is hoping to achieve through unionization is “a better quality of life for graduate students,” Harding said. “Not that our quality of life is necessarily bad, but without a legal, binding contract, it’s liable for change,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">“If your department falls on hard times, or the University decides to fund some other project … you have no leg to stand on” without a contract, Harding said. He also pointed out that there are disparities between departments, and that by standing with other graduate students you can help your peers. For example, the minimum stipend is $24,870, but some departments pay more than that or have different policies for how that funding is dispensed, Harding said.</p>
<p class="p2">For Skitka, there is a “broad ideological argument” for why a union would benefit graduate students.</p>
<p class="p2">The nature of the administration is that they don’t interact with graduate students on a daily basis and that “their decisions and how they use their power will sometimes leave people behind,” Skitka said. “They will operate in such a way that will try to advance things they care about, like the standing of the University (or the) rankings of departments,” which don’t necessarily speak to the needs of graduate students.</p>
<p class="p2">“A natural way to resolve the issue of people being left behind is to share power among everyone who is affected by and contributes to the functioning of the University,” Skitka said.</p>
<p class="p2">Unionizing could also achieve wage increases, a more robust grievance procedure and a contract obligating the University to follow through on whatever the bargaining unit and the administration agree upon, Skitka said. Some students may not feel comfortable using the grievance procedures built into the University concerning issues pertaining to sexual assault, summer funding, being asked to serve as a teaching assistant for multiple courses or being able to afford health care for dependents, he added. Affiliating with a union and creating a contract could provide enforceable timelines for responding to concerns. In addition, students feeling overworked could notify the union, which “will send in a representative” on behalf of the student to raise the concern.</p>
<p class="p2">The 2004 decision of the National Labor Relations Board in Brown U. v. United Association of Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America — which ruled that graduate students at private universities were not an appropriate unit for collective bargaining — was overturned this past August, clearing the way for unionization at private schools like Brown.</p>
<p class="p2">In the months since the overturn of the decision, graduate students across the country have taken steps toward unionization, most notably in the Ivy League, where votes on unionization have already occurred on multiple campuses. Votes on the right of student unions to collectively bargain for graduate students employed by their universities have already taken place at Columbia, Harvard and Yale with mixed results. A <a href="https://gradschool.cornell.edu/union-representation">vote on unionization</a> at Cornell will take place from March 27 to March 28.</p>
<p class="p2">Unionization “comes down to enabling effective collective action,” said Danielle Dirocco, executive director of the Graduate Assistants Union at the University of Rhode Island. “When push comes to shove, and we’re not getting paid well, we have the means to come together and apply pressure in an official way to our administration to ensure that our needs are being met,” she added. “And we’re able to do it in an amicable way.”</p>
<p class="p2">Because URI is a public university and not covered by the original Brown decision, graduate students at URI affiliated under the American Association of University Professors in 2002, negotiating their first contract around wages and insurance that year.</p>
<p class="p2">The concerns of graduate students at URI have continued to revolve around high student fees and low stipends, as well as limited on- and off-campus housing and parking passes, Dirocco said. A level one stipend for the first two years as a master’s student is $17,184 per year. With a maximum 20-hour work week, this amounts to a $23.87 hourly wage.</p>
<p class="p2">Graduate students at Brown are concerned with having to pay dues regardless of whether or not they want to join the union, according to the FAQ sheet. The average dues paid by UAW affiliates is 1.44 percent of their salary. Harding says that if a union is formed, they will work to negotiate for “a pay raise that covers dues so that we don’t see a difference.” Comparatively, URI graduate students are expected to pay $1,566 in annual fees, but can receive a 20 percent waiver if they hold a teaching or research “assistanceship” qualifying them for a stipend. According to Dirocco, even part-time graduate employees pay the full fee, as well as any graduate student who does not have an assistanceship, meaning they are not currently a teaching assistant or research assistant. Additionally, some departments offer acceptance to graduate students they cannot afford to support in an assistanceship role and therefore are only paid the hourly wage without their tuition being waived — something that is common for most PhD students.</p>
<p class="p2">A notable aspect of URI’s unionization was that the “president of the university said, ‘You guys need to unionize,’” Dirocco said, adding that as a whole, “we had strong encouragement from our administration to unionize.”</p>
<p class="p2">Such institutional support is a far cry from the reality faced by graduate students at many private universities, which have historically opposed unionization on their campuses. Before a judge reversed the Brown decision, the University, along with eight other private institutions, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/02/university-files-brief-against-grad-student-unionization/">filed an amicus brief</a> March 1, 2016 arguing that the NLRB should continue to consider research assistants and TAs as students, not employees.</p>
<p class="p2">While graduate students attempted to unionize in 2004, former Provost Robert Zimmer issued a statement that the “NLRB correctly recognizes that a graduate student’s experience is a mentoring relationship between faculty and students and is not a matter appropriate for collective bargaining.”</p>
<p class="p2">Despite its past opposition, the University has not indicated that it intends to push the issue any further. When the NLRB reversed the Brown decision in 2016, the “University made it clear that we would comply with the ruling,” wrote Dean of the Graduate School Andrew Campbell in an email to The Herald. “We acknowledged that it would be the decision of eligible graduate students as to whether or not unionization was right for them, and we <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2004-05/04-004.html">affirmed our commitment</a> to promoting an environment that supports open and informed discussion, free of intimidation by any party.”</p>
<p class="p2"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article misstated that SUGSE members decided between which labor union the organization would affiliate. In fact, all graduate students were eligible to vote on which labor union SUGSE would affiliate with. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Recently elected Chairman of the Democratic Party Tom Perez ’83 P’18 and Gov. Gina Raimondo spoke on the necessity of higher education in creating jobs and opportunity in relation to the Rhode Island Promise Scholarship at Rhode Island College April 6. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The conversation centered on recent efforts to lower education costs, notably Raimondo’s recent proposal to expand the RI Promise program, which would provide two years of free college tuition at the Community College of Rhode Island, the University of Rhode Island and RIC for qualified Rhode Island high school graduates who are enrolled full-time. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We want Rhode Island to be a place where everyone has a fair shot at education equity and upwards mobility,” Raimondo said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“What (Raimondo’s) doing is indispensable for the long-term success for Rhode Island and frankly the nation. We have to eliminate the term ‘education mortgage’ from our vocabulary,” Perez told The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Only four out of every 10 citizens in Rhode Island have an education past high school, Raimondo said. She stressed that the scholarship is open to every student in Rhode Island that meets the qualifications of the program, regardless of socioeconomic status. “I want 10 out of 10 Rhode Islanders to be prepared for the jobs of tomorrow,” Perez said. “Education is the great equalizer,” Perez repeated throughout the event.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(The scholarship is) about giving all the hard-working people of Rhode Island a degree without a bundle of debt,” Raimondo said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the chairman of the Democratic Party, Perez believes the party will continue to make strides towards lowering the price of higher education. “I want to make sure that everyone in this room knows that when you go and get an education, you can come out without a mortgage and with the future in the palms of your hands,” Perez said to the students in attendance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When I see (the Trump) administration cut funding for higher education, it makes no sense,” Perez told The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But investing in higher education is not just a partisan issue, Perez said, pointing to a Republican governor in Tennesee who introduced similar legislation regarding education investments. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“College affordability isn’t just an issue for Democrats — it’s an issue for Democrats and Republicans alike,” Perez told The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Education is what Democrats have always fought for. Budgets are moral documents — we want people to know not the rhetoric of the administration but the actions,” Perez said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It doesn’t ‘make America great’ to cut investments in human capital,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Simply put, investing in education makes the nation stronger, Perez said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This is about equipping Rhode Island for the future,” Raimondo said. “Let’s be the state that isn’t stuck.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Grassroots organizing is an important method to mobilize both parties toward adapting education reform policy, Perez said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “We need to be a nation of dreams and a nation of doers,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The conversation was hosted by the Rhode Island Democratic Party, the Young Democrats of Rhode Island and the College Democrats of Rhode Island. The event was open to the public.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b>Residents and educators of all backgrounds gathered to create a future vision for the city’s education system at the All In: Providence Education Moonshot Summit, April 8.</p>
<p class="p4">The event was made possible by support by the Harvard Graduate School of Education, city community members and a $200,000 grant by the Nellie Mae Education Foundation — an organization devoted to educational reforms in New England — according to NMEF Director of Strategic Communications Shaun Adamec.</p>
<p class="p4">The summit sought the input of parents, educators and students “to make a citywide commitment to ensuring that all Providence students are successful,” according to a press release from the mayor’s office.</p>
<p class="p4">An estimated 450 to 500 people attended the summit, said Mayor Jorge Elorza. Working in groups, community members cited values such as “accessibility,” “community engagement” and “diversity and inclusion” as the foundation for future educational reforms.</p>
<p class="p4">“I truly believe we can have the highest performing urban education department in the country,” Elorza said. “I know in order to accomplish that, we need to continue with the steps that we’re taking — but we can’t do it without the community,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Suon Keo, a student at Classical High School, voiced her concerns with the current education structure, noting that the transition from a lower-performing school to one with more rigorous standards was exceptionally difficult for her, Keo said.</p>
<p class="p4">“When I got into Classical, there was a whole new dynamic and cultural shift for me because I wasn’t taught these tactics — how to test-take, how to study or what to study — so it was hard,” Keo said, adding that she would like to see future education reforms alleviate inequalities in Providence’s school districts.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Classical, frequently ranked as one of the top schools in the state, stands above most others in the Providence school district as a magnet school with reading and mathematics proficiency scores more than double the city average, according to 2016 Rhode Island District Report Card education data. By the same metrics, Central High School, located in the same city block as Classical, performed at around half the city average. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s unfair because the environment (at each school) is so different, and when it’s different, there are different levels of expectation,” Keo said. She hopes new teacher trainings will increase awareness of the diverse history and cultural backgrounds of students while also increasing student’s access to emotional support beyond that of a guidance counselor, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I just wish there could be a better relationship between students and teachers, so they can better understand each other, work together and build a bigger picture within school relations,” Keo said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jenny Li ’14, a current educator at Attleboro High School in Massachusetts, spoke about the obstacles that she and many other teachers experience due to the lack of support within the education system. Li hopes more Providence students will be encouraged to invest in the community and go into teaching.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s important to continue holding spaces like this where folks can literally see each other (and) speak to one another ... because so much of that is not encouraged in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the school system,” Li said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elorza said that input from the crowd would influence future work on the city’s education system. “At the very least, going forward, we are going to make sure we report back to this group to let them know how it’s influenced the work we are doing and continue to do,” Elorza said, praising the summit’s ability to unite Providence residents.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We want to continue to open up different avenues and pathways for people to engage with us,” Elorza said. “I think there’s going to be a lot of positivity coming from this.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled the name of NMEF Director of Strategic Communications Shaun Adamec as "Sean Adamec." The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wow Barbecue to move into 183 Angell St. between March, May</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> A new restaurant is coming to Thayer in the form of Wow Barbecue, a Chinese eatery with two locations already open in Boston.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> With the establishment of Wow, Thayer now counts two barbecue restaurants among its own, along with Durk’s Bar-B-Q which came to Thayer this past February.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Wow will be located at 183 Angell St. — across from Korean Fried Chicken and only blocks from Durk’s. While the possibility for competition remains, Wow promises grilled options more in line with traditional Chinese barbecue rather than the Southern fare offered at Durk’s.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Wow’s store managers seemed unfazed by the preponderance of Asian cuisine already offered on College Hill. “There are a couple of Chinese restaurants in the area,” the managers wrote in a business plan submitted to the Providence Board of Licenses,“but none of them does Chinese BBQ.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> At Wow’s existing Boston restaurants, this concept translates into dishes likely more familiar to American audiences such as crab rangoons, General Tso’s Chicken and fried rice, in addition to more authentic Chinese cuisine like grilled pig feet, lamb kidney and chicken heart.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “We are a restaurant inspired by authentic Chinese BBQ skewers,” the store’s managers wrote. The skewers will be available in meat, vegetable and seafood options, in addition to some “larger Sichuan family style dishes to share,” they added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> At lunchtime, the restaurant “will (have) a fast food environment” based on the sale of lunch box and noodle dishes while dinner will be characterized by a casual, sit-down dining experience, the managers wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> While the exact date of Wow’s arrival is still unknown, a website for the Thayer Street District Management Authority lists its opening as sometime between March and May of this year.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New restaurants to come to Thayer Street</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/17/new-restaurants-come-thayer-street/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1HkcNLJCZVIgKdSaQlkFcVBfco3I" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">While the recently announced departure of Thayer Street staples like Nice Slice, Rockstar and Johnny Rockets may have been a blow to the College Hill community, director of the Thayer Street District Management Authority Donna Personeus confirmed that the blow may be softened by the establishment of two new restaurants — Tropical Smoothie Café and Chopsticks — on Thayer Street.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chopsticks will be located at 277 Thayer St., between the Army/Navy Surplus store and Durk’s Bar-B-Q while Tropical Smoothie Café will occupy the vacant lot above Soban Korean Eatery at 272 Thayer St.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Tropical Smoothie Cafe — which has a location in Wayland Square and hundreds nationwide — is known for its wide array of smoothies, ranging from “indulgent” offerings on their menu like the Mocha Madness — made with chocolate, coffee, cappuccino and non-fat yogurt — to “superfood” smoothies, which contain more salutary ingredients like kale, spinach and a variety of fruits.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> For those unwilling to imbibe their nutrients in blended form, the chain also offers a selection of wraps, sandwiches and flatbreads including the featured “Cha Cha Sriracha Flatbread,” which consists of grilled chicken, mozzarella, pineapple salsa and a caramelized pineapple Sriracha sauce. The restaurant’s opening date is uncertain, but Personeus placed it around May of this year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Chopsticks is a new business that will function like a grab-and-go establishment, offering Chinese stir-fry options to the residents of College Hill. Personeus said the restaurant will open sometime around June or July — fully operational in time for classes in the fall.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> While no establishment has billed itself in exactly the same manner, Chopsticks will have to find a niche of its own on a hill that is already saturated with restaurants offering a wide range of Asian cuisines.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Along with the recently announced Chinese-skewer joint Wow Barbecue, Chopsticks must also compete with Soban, Haruki Express, Shanghai, Sushi Express, Yan’s Cuisine, Wong’s Kitchen and Den-Den’s College Hill outpost Korean Fried Chicken.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “Property owners are trying to move in businesses that are going to be successful in the long-run,” Personeus said. “But they’re trying to listen to students and other members of the community at the same time.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Personeus pointed to the soon-to-be arrival of restaurants like by CHLOE — known for its offering of 100 percent vegan and kosher-certified food — and southern-style Durk’s Bar-B-Q as evidence of this receptiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> While Personeus could only confirm the establishment of Chopsticks and Tropical Smoothie, she acknowledged that new businesses would be opening in the spaces formerly occupied by English Cellar Alehouse and Nice Slice in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Additionally, the legal details of a development on the abandoned building at 249 Thayer St. are currently being worked out.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> While negotiations are still underway, Personeus said she anticipated that the lot will be converted into a four-story building, the first floor of which will have space available for a business. Two floors would serve as office space while the top floor would function as space for high-end condominiums.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Personeus said that these developments, as well as others currently in the works that cannot yet be confirmed, are evidence of positive development for a street whose future once seemed uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It looked for a long time like Thayer was dying,” Personeus said. “But the Thayer Renaissance is on, and you never know what’s going to come next.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">                                                                                     </span></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Initial Community Safety Act vote passes unanimously in City Hall</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Updated April 24 at 8:20 p.m. </strong>

The Providence City Council unanimously passed the initial vote of the Community Safety Act Thursday night at Providence City Hall, with 12 city council members voting yes and three city council members absent. The ordinance seeks to prohibit racial profiling in policing and rehabilitate the Providence police’s relationship with the community. Its passage marks the culmination of three years of work between community activists, elected representatives, business owners and lawyers. The second and final round of voting will take place April 27, according to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CommunitySafetyAct/">CSA Facebook page</a>.

Major provisions of the CSA include a full ban on racial profiling by the police, a rule that traffic violations may not be used as basis for search or arrest and a requirement that police publicly disclose the criteria by which individuals are added to the city’s “gang” list and provide procedures for those on the list to appeal to have their name removed. The ordinance passed with an amendment that will track the implementation of the CSA by police stations. That ordinance also found unanimous approval.

“This is not the time for kicking the can down the road,” said Mary Kay Harris, a city council member, before the vote took place. She urged her fellow members to vote in favor of the measure. “We have the responsibility of ending racial and discriminatory profiling. We have the responsibility of ensuring people are treated with dignity and respect.”

With the CSA, the “community came to us with what they saw as a problem, but they didn’t just throw rocks at the problem,” said Kevin Jackson, another city council member. The city council had held two public hearings on the CSA, and public testimony on the ordinance has leaned “overwhelmingly in favor,” Jackson said. “There’s been discussion with anyone and everyone that wanted (to be at) the table.”

“I want to thank the Providence Police department and their families,” said Councilman Nicholas Narducci. His comment was met with applause from the part of the room  where members of the Providence Fraternal Order of Police — the providence police union — sat.

Councilman Ryan Principe also thanked the police department and added that the CSA would serve the Providence Police as well, because the act offered a standardized policy on police conduct that would guide their work in the field.

Spectators overflowed the chamber as the meeting came into session, 45 minutes before the CSA was even introduced. Observers held signs above their heads reading “Police accountability now” and “Pass the Community Safety Act”. When the ordinance passed, the crowd broke out into applause and cheers before initiating a chant of “Whose city? Our city”.

The Fraternal Order of Police filed out of chambers immediately after the CSA passed. Though the Providence Chief of Police has endorsed the CSA, the Fraternal Order of Police opposes the ordinance, The Providence Journal previously reported. The Fraternal Order of Police did not reference any specific provision of the ordinance as reason for their opposition, but argued that the ordinance will not ameliorate but rather exacerbate tensions between the city and the police department,<a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170419/providence-police-union-opposes-community-safety-ordinance"> the Journal reported</a>.

Community members expressed more enthusiasm for the ordinance.

“I just think it’s exciting that we’re creating one of the most comprehensive municipal” ordinances on racial profiling in the country, said Kodei Ishihara, who lived in Providence for 15 years before relocating. Though the CSA took three years to pass, debate in Providence around police misconduct goes back 30 years, Ishihara said.

“It’s taken many groups to work together, and that’s what’s important,” said Anne Landis, a teacher at the Moses Brown School in Providence. Deliberations around the CSA brought to light the disparate treatment of people of color in Providence by police versus what “white people on the East Side” experience day to day, she said.

“I’ve been with the CSA since the beginning,” said Kimberly Dy, a member of the main team that crafted the ordinance, adding that seeing the CSA finally pass had left her “speechless.” Reforms to the gang database and the language access provision — which ensures that individuals for whom English is a second language will be given a qualified interpreter before police questioning begins — are two points of the CSA that she found particularly impactful. “It hits home for me,” she said. For her, the three-year process of crafting the CSA has “been a hell of a fight.”

<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of the article misstated that the Community Safety Act passed unanimously in City Hall Thursday. In fact, the CSA only passed its first round of voting. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>U Melt to bring innovative grilled cheese to Thayer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A newcomer will be joining the ranks of Thayer Street businesses after a Providence Board of Licenses meeting Monday granted tentative approval for the opening of a U Melt on College Hill. The approval came the same day the owners received keys for their new location: the space at 267 Thayer formerly occupied by Nice Slice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">U Melt bills itself as a “gourmet grilled cheese store” offering a number of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>options ranging in complexity from the “Classic” sandwich of American cheese on white bread to a bevy of more specific delicacies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The Chipster,” for instance, elevates a simple cheddar and bacon on sourdough with the addition of BBQ Cape Cod potato chips. On a more sophisticated note, the “Turkey Brie” consists of brie cheese, roasted turkey and shallot fig jam on rye.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For those feeling a touch less sophisticated, the “White Trash” sandwich combines mac and cheese, cheddar and BBQ pulled pork on sourdough for a unique take on a traditionally simple dish.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At its downtown location, two salads are available — relatively tame interpretations of a Caesar and Greek — while another sandwich of sorts is available for dessert: the S’mores. Sandwiching Nutella, graham crackers and marshmallow fluff between two slices of raisin bread — the store’s singular sugary offering could even rival the fare of other Thayer Street sweet spots Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Insomnia Cookies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">U Melt’s downtown location is adjacent to the campus of Johnson and Wales University, a factor co-founder Jonathan Kaufman said has been integral to the store’s success.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Johnson and Wales is a great community,” Kaufman said, adding that the store has employed a number of JWU culinary students over the years who understand U Melt’s unconventional interpretations of grilled cheese.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We get a little traffic from” College Hill, Kaufman said, “but we’re so excited now to share U Melt with the Brown and RISD communities, not to mention residents of the East Side.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Establishing a location on Thayer has been a goal of Kaufman’s since he and co-owners Benjamin and Jessica Wood first opened U Melt in 2013. Kaufman met and befriended the couple while working for them during his studies at the University of Rhode Island and said that opening a restaurant together had been a mutual dream for years. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Renovations, menu tweaking and other logistical formalities must be completed before U Melt can open, but Kaufman said that the owners are aiming to be operational by the end of the summer. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>People’s Climate Mobilization to take place Saturday at RI State House</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The Rhode Island Student Climate Coalition will host a sister march April 29 at 11 a.m. at the Rhode Island State House as hundreds of protesters gather for the People’s Climate Movement in Washington.</p>
<p class="p4">The march follows the 2014 People’s Climate March in New York City, which called on world leaders to take more action fighting climate change. The mobilization represents a large coalition bringing “different environmental and social justice groups across the state together for a more effective environmental movement,” said Jon Gewirtzman ’17, an RISCC organizer of the event.</p>
<p class="p4">The march also comes on the heels of President Trump’s March budget proposal, which would cut funding for the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent. In the past, he has also called global warming a hoax created by the Chinese.</p>
<p class="p4">“Donald Trump is a threat to the future of our planet, the safety of our communities and the health of our families,” reads a statement on the march’s website.</p>
<p class="p4">Trump’s campaign promise to pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate action is proof that “his administration doesn’t really appreciate how big of an issue climate change is,” said Sarah Lettes ’19, a RISCC member and organizer.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’re not just fighting for a healthier climate and cleaner air,” Lettes said. “What we’re marching for is (also) jobs, injustice and an economy that’s more fair and more locally driven.”</p>
<p class="p4">While traditional environmental organizations such as Save The Bay and Audubon Society are expected to attend, movements that center on other social issues will also make an appearance. The list of speakers includes Adnan Adrian Wood-Smith, the University’s associate chaplain for the Muslim community and president of the R.I. Council for Muslim Advancement, and Michael Araujo, executive director of R.I. Jobs with Justice — a worker’s advocacy organization.</p>
<p class="p4">“All these people are affected by local environmental issues and climate change, and we’re all here fighting regardless of what movements we’re already plugged into,” said Lauren Maunus ’19, an RISCC event organizer.</p>
<p class="p4">Members of RISCC were approached by J. Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology, and asked to spearhead the movement after Rhode Island was left as the only state without a planned march for April 29. The organizers hope the mobilization will put pressure on both national and local governments to take action against climate change.</p>
<p class="p4">“There’s a lot of division within Trump’s advisors on whether or not to move along with (the Paris Agreement),” Lettes said. “Hopefully this march will be one more force to push them towards action rather than backing away,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">On a local level, the RISCC hopes the march will show a large backing for environmentally-friendly local legislation, such as the Energize R.I. Act,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>which prices carbon to reduce emissions and is now in its third year of legislation without passage.</p>
<p class="p4">The RISCC aims to elevate the voices of Rhode Island citizens in the march and wants to put high-schoolers and middle-schoolers at the forefront because “they’re the ones who are going to be here a long time,” Lettes said. “This is their community.”</p>
<p class="p4">Kaylynn Polley, a senior at Rocky Hill School, is scheduled to speak at the march Saturday. Polley, whose interest in environmental science was sparked when she volunteered at the Save the Bay Exploration Center in Newport two years ago, has been contacting other high schools and community service clubs to spread the word.</p>
<p class="p4">“The younger generations are the ones that can be the most passionate about (climate change) because this is our future,” Polley said.</p>
<p class="p4">Beyond the mobilization on Saturday, RISCC hopes to get involved with the other movements taking place across Rhode Island, including an upcoming march for labor rights and justice.</p>
<p class="p4">“A lot of what we want to achieve aligns with those goals because the forefront of climate change action should be social justice,” Lettes said. “We want to make sure people are connected to those efforts.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it would end the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program, a policy enacted by the Obama administration in 2012 that offers legal protections to individuals who entered the United States as children without documentation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The decision, which places roughly 800,000 DACA recipients, also known as “Dreamers,” at risk for deportation, was met with criticism from elected officials in Rhode Island who spoke at a press conference held at the Segue Institute for Learning in Central Falls.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In her speech at the event, Gov. Gina Raimondo said that Rhode Island stands “behind (its) Dreamers … we want them to know that there’s a place in Rhode Island for everybody.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Like other Rhode Island leaders, the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170323/raimondo-if-trumpcare-passes-everythings-at-risk">governor has criticized</a> several of Trump’s proposed policies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Let’s send a message to (President Donald Trump) … and members of Congress who are trying to divide America in this time … (that) their policies of hate and cruelty … aren’t going to be tolerated in our country or our state,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Peter Kilmartin, attorney general of Rhode Island, also spoke at the conference and announced that he would join “other like-minded attorney generals” in legally challenging Trump’s decision to end the program on behalf of the state of Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Trump has committed a moral crime against children by rescinding this order today,” Kilmartin said. He also urged attendees to “put the pressure on Congress” to pass legislation that would protect DACA recipients.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mayor Jorge Elorza said that Dreamers are “Americans in every sense of the word,” and to repeal the program is a “cruel-hearted” decision.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This marks a day that is an assault, an attack on the American dream for 800,000 young people in our country,” he added. Dreamers are “simply asking for the opportunity to continue studying, working and defending our country in the military. … They deserve the ability to pursue the American dream.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Two Dreamers also spoke at the event, including Javier Juarez MA’18. Juarez spoke about his journey to Brown, which he felt was made possible by programs like DACA. Juarez, who planned to attend law school next fall, said Trump’s decision saddened him as it meant his accomplishments could vanish.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Juarez told The Herald he came to the United States when he was 10 and has lived in Rhode Island for the past 18 years. “It’s frustrating when people are like, ‘You’re an illegal alien,’” Juarez said. “They don’t know how much I’ve become part of this community or how much I’ve contributed to this community.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Juarez said that he felt that his work with the Coalition of Advocates for Student Opportunities, which connected him with younger students from similar backgrounds as himself, gave him a “sense of responsibility” to speak publicly about his experiences as a DACA recipient.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When I have the opportunity, I’m going to speak for the students I work with that don’t have the courage to come out,” Juarez said. “But I also have to deal with reality, which is I’m (at Brown) now. … I have to register for classes. I have to fund my degree.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The latest decision to rollback the DACA program complicates Juarez’s ability to pay for his degree at Brown. “Is it smart for me to take out a loan knowing that I should save money in case I get deported?” Juarez said. While he previously had the security to work and pay off his loan, Juarez said he is now dealing with “a ticking time bomb” given the program’s new expiration date.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Being forced to make these decisions is tough mentally,” Juarez said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Juarez said he is happy to be at a university that supports its DACA students. “My own department, the American studies department … reached out to me saying (that they) hoped everything was okay,” he said. It<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“feels like you belong and like people are looking out for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Juarez said that it was important for people who aren’t personally affected by the decision to end DACA to “advocate on behalf of those people that are scared to come out.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“These are people who cannot vote. I pay taxes, but I cannot vote,” he added. Given Congress’ responsibility to replace the program, Juarez stressed the importance of placing pressure on Congressional members and attorney generals around the country to allow Dreamers to stay.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">Members and supporters of the Pokanoket Nation marched Tuesday from Brown Street Park to the University demanding the reclamation of University-owned property in Bristol. Approximately 40 people attended the march and chanted next to the Van Wickle Gates as first-years entered for convocation. The protest comes two weeks after the Pokanoket established an encampment, Po Metacom Camp, at the disputed land in Bristol. The site is considered the tribe’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>holy ground as the site of the beheading of the Pokanoket chief Metacomet, whose English name was King Philip, in 1676. The land was donated to the University by the Haffenreffer family, which acquired the land in 1903 to use as a summer home, according to the Haffenreffer Museum’s website. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The march was organized to “make a statement,” said Harry “The Hawk” Quanunon Edmonds, sachem of the Pokanoket Nation. “We want our sacred land back.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some Brown current and former students marched alongside the Pokanoket, including members of the Fighting Against Natural Gas — or FANG — Collective, which has helped to advocate for the tribe.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a letter to Sagamore Po Wauipi Neimpaug of the Pokanoket Nation published online, Executive Vice President for Planning and Policy Russell Carey ’91 MA’06 said plans to resolve the dispute “will not and cannot initiate while the current encampment is ongoing” but that the University will solidify its plans after the encampment is completely cleared.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University submitted a proposal to the tribe, which would offer to complete a “cultural and environmental resource survey” and commit to work with “all Native peoples … with an interest and stake in the past, present and future of the Bristol property.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Negotiations have been stalled due to a disagreement on whether other tribes in the area also have claims to the contested property, Neimpaug said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a statement published online, the University wrote that it “does not find ethical or acceptable” that the Pokanoket Nation “refuses to recognize” that several Wampanoag tribes, which are federally recognized and also native to the area, and the Narragansett Indian Tribe also consider the land as sacred.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Pokanoket Nation “is not recognized by the other federally recognized Wampanoag communities,” wrote the Steering Committee of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Initiative in a community-wide email Aug. 24.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Neimpaug said that Pokanoket identity was criminalized and punishable by death during King Philip’s War in the 1670s. So Pokanoket tribe members thus referred to themselves as Wampanoag to avoid punishment, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University “recognizes that these lands were historically Pokanoket” and “that after King Philip’s War people from the Pokanokets were dispersed among several other Native tribes,” wrote Director of News and Editorial Development Brian Clark in an email to The Herald. The University has given other tribes access to the Bristol property as well, in addition to the Pokanoket. “There is no dispute that this site holds great significance for a number of native and indigenous peoples,” Clark wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The NAIS also emphasized that “the Pokanoket Tribe is not recognized by the federal government or the state.” Neimpaug said the Pokanoket does not seek federal recognition, viewing its entering under the U.S. government’s jurisdiction as a loss of their rights.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bristol property houses the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology’s Collections Research Center. “Some of the things that are in that museum belong to my people,” Neimpaug said. The museum’s collection includes artifacts that were part of an exhibit on King Philip, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Every year, the Pokanoket perform many sacred ceremonies, such as the Strawberry Thanksgiving and a cultural summer camp on the land, but “we don’t feel as though we should be asking (Brown) permission” to do so, Neimpaug said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[gallery columns="1" size="medium" ids="2826504,2826506,2826505,2826503,2826502,2826501,2826500,2826499,2826498,2826497,2826496"]



<span class="s1"><b>
</b></span>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">As students return from summer recess, they’ll find Thayer Street slightly altered from when they last left it. With a selection of new businesses both operational and impending, the hub of traffic and commerce continues to change its face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">UMelt, the aptly named grilled cheese establishment, opened its doors on Thayer Aug. 28, taking over the space formerly occupied by Nice Slice Pizzeria. The restaurant had a quiet opening, preferring a modest approach as opposed to great fanfare, said co-owner Jonathan Kaufman.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“So far, reception has been good, people seem to like the space and really like the food,” Kaufman said, adding that the store’s commitment to composting just about all waste created on the premises has been a popular facet of the establishment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">UMelt’s menu is identical to the menu at its downtown restaurant, but both were changed slightly to celebrate the opening of the Thayer Street outpost. The “Pepperjack” for instance — comprising pepperjack cheese and homemade tomato jam — is already giving the chain’s most popular offering, the “White Trash” sandwich, a run for its money.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Next door to UMelt is now b.good, a Northeast chain that prides itself on offering food with “roots.” Operating out of the space once held by Thayer staple Johnny Rockets, the business offers a menu that changes seasonally based on the availability of certain produce.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Elizel Burger — seared asparagus, grilled red onion, red pepper aioli, sharp cheddar and toasted breadcrumbs — for instance, has given way this fall to the Sal Bacado, a seasonal offering which includes local corn salsa, bacon and avocado.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There is also work underway on some district additions that have yet to come to fruition. Heng, a Thai cuisine restaurant, has obtained a license to open in the English Cellar Alehouse space on Angell Street. While signage for the restaurant can be seen outside its slated location, its exact opening date remains unclear.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">In a business plan submitted to the Providence Board of Licenses, the business owners laid out a plan to offer Thai food — and liquor — to residents of the East Side. The menu submitted to the board includes Thai staples like chicken satay, pad Thai and a variety of curries, as well as wok and other noodle offerings.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Heng will have to carve out a niche of its own on a street populated with unique Asian cuisine — such as Soban, Den Den Korean Fried Chicken and Shanghai — but the addition of a Thai establishment is something of a novelty for the area.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Work is also moving forward to open Vivi Bubble Tea in the small space located underneath Ben &amp; Jerry’s. The fledgling business will have to compete with Kung Fu Tea and other Thayer Street restaurants already offering the Taiwanese treat.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not all developments on Thayer are culinary in nature. An eyebrow threader has set up shop above the former Nice Slice location, offering a new service for Thayer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition, a virtual reality lounge has also gone into business on Thayer. Base Station VR Lounge operates five VR stations at its location above Kartabar, each offering a number of games and experiences for users, said owner Nidal Battikha. From Google Earth to games like Solus and Fruit Ninja, patrons can reserve a spot or walk in for an experience that defies reality.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While Thayer has seen turnover in some of its storefronts in recent years, the benefits of the location continue to draw businesses there year after year, Thayer business owners said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re close to the colleges and residents of the East Side,” Battikha said, adding that “the people in the Thayer Street district seem to be good at building a community among merchants as well as connecting to the broader community.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I walk my dog on Thayer almost every night,” Kaufman said, “Seeing all the businesses on the street, being a business owner myself and having it be a part of my backyard; it’s been a dream of mine to open up a store here.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>City Council approves bike lane study, removal of Confederate flags</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">At Thursday’s Providence City Council meeting, the city passed resolutions calling for a study of bike lanes as well as the removal of Confederate flags and monuments from public property. Providence’s decision follows similar resolutions passed in other U.S. cities in the wake of violence in Charlottesville over similar monuments this summer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Councilman David Salvatore, who introduced the monument resolution, said that it would take a position on racism on the right side of history. Many council members thanked Salvatore for raising the issue. Councilman Luis Aponte expressed shock at the events in Charlottesville and noted the importance of removing these symbols, opening up a dialogue and learning from history. The resolution passed unanimously. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a heated debate, the council also approved a resolution that would require Providence to conduct a full traffic and economic impact study of its bike lanes. The resolution, proposed by Aponte, requests that the City Traffic Engineer, Director of the Department of Public Works and the Parking Administration conduct the study and make it available for public comment prior to deciding whether to construct new bike lanes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aponte argued that the addition of bike lanes could produce unintended consequences if the city does not first engage property owners or small businesses in neighborhoods or commercial corridors. He said that constructing bike lanes may cause businesses to lose parking spaces, potentially resulting in customer losses for businesses. “They’ve said to me, “If I lose another parking spot, I might as well shut my company,’” Aponte said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Councilman Seth Yurdin opposed the resolution, noting the cost and redundancy of an economic impact study. He said the study would pose a barrier to design, and the number of steps involved in the study would stall the process of adding bike lanes. Yurdin also noted that bike lanes fix a public safety problem and urged the city to put its citizens first.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris supported the resolution, arguing that the city needs the opportunity to understand the issue and engage everyone. Councilman John Igliozzi echoed her concerns. “Why is this so difficult to make sure committees are engaged? Why is this such a bad thing?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Members of the Rhode Island Bicycle Coalition also attended the meeting, strongly opposing the biking resolution. Melissa Jenkins, a Brown professor and a member of the RI Bicycle Coalition, said that conducting impact studies for each proposed bike lane is not a standard procedure, but rather creates unnecessary hurdles to building bike lanes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The resolution may have passed today, but Mayor (Jorge) Elorza is likely to veto it — he is very bike-friendly,” Jenkins added. She said that the group would continue to fight for the city’s bike lanes.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hundreds of people gathered on the State House lawn Saturday to eat foods from multiple cultures, purchase homemade crafts and speak with representatives from more than 20 different countries. It was the 40th Rhode Island Heritage Day Festival, an event that convenes each year to celebrate the many cultural communities that make up the state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The day was chock full of events from noon to 5 p.m. When attendees weren’t walking through colorful table displays, they were watching dancers and musicians —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>groups like the Eastern Medicine Singers, the Scandanavian Women’s Chorus of Rhode Island and Ballet Folklorico Guadalupano, among many others — perform. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Country representatives and Boy Scouts opened the festival, marching with flags from each country toward the State House. Mercedes Monteiro, the heritage program coordinator for the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission, organized the festival from start to finish, as she has for the past 16 years. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We don’t have to hate each other. There’s no reason for it,” she said. “I think by celebrating the diversity of Rhode Island, the generations to come will work together. We can celebrate each other without losing our own identity.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Usually the festival hosts around 200 to 500 people in the Roger Williams National Memorial, but this year the festival’s change of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>location to outside the State House made it more visible. Kobi Dennis, festival host and community activist, thought the move might have helped the event draw even larger crowds.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We try to represent as many countries as we can. As you see, we have people from the Caribbean, Puerto Rico, India — all over the world. And what we try to do is show people the communities Rhode Island consists of,” Dennis said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Everyone involved, from the table managers to the flag bearers, were volunteers. Many get involved with the festival yearly, Dennis said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Volunteers get drawn into the festival through its partners. MJ Martins, for example, volunteered to represent Portugal this year. She found out about the Heritage Day Festival through a different Rhode Island event, the Day of Portugal, over ten years ago and has been volunteering yearly ever since.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission’s Deputy Director, Jeff Emidy, emphasized the value of celebrating the state’s rich cultural communities in his opening remarks at the festival. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“My son goes to school in Providence in a community of children whose parents come from places that were unknown to me at that age. It helps him to be a more worldly, passionate and inclusive person. I hope the youngest generations of our state and country have the same opportunities to understand and accept people of different cultures, and that’s the reason we are here today,” Emidy said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[gallery columns="1" size="medium" ids="2826556,2826557,2826558,2826559,2826560,2826561"]
<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">Local activists, elected officials and Brown students protested President Trump’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program Friday. Trump’s decision to allow DACA to expire next year has left some students and Providence community members with uncertain futures.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The program, which was created through an executive order issued by former President Barack Obama in 2012, offers legal work permits and renewable protection from deportation for two years to undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>March to the State House</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starting at Burnside Park, the protest was organized by the Coalition of Advocates for Student Opportunities, the Providence Immigrant Rights Coalition, the Brown Immigrant Rights Coalition and the Providence Student Union. It ended in speeches from DACA recipients, an immigration lawyer and other allies of the undocumented immigrant community on the steps of the State House.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Krissia Rivera Perla ’15 MD’21 spoke to the crowd about her desire to become a doctor and her experiences as a DACA recipient. She added that the issues surrounding DACA were not “about political beliefs. It’s about sympathy and love. We deserve better simply because we’re human beings.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We fought for so long to be treated as human beings with dignity,” she told The Herald. “We are contributing to this country, and, everyday, we are being demeaned by the media.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yaruska Ordinola, a DACA recipient who graduated from the University of Rhode Island, also addressed demonstrators.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">She told The Herald she was initially afraid when she heard about Trump’s decision because she believed she would “lose everything … the ability to have a license, the ability to have an ID, the ability to work.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, she said that fear then turned into “disappointment and then it turned into empowerment … (because) DACA does not define me.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We all knew it was a temporary” solution, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Renata Mauriz ’17.5 also addressed the crowd about the issues she faced as a DACA recipient, like having to use her economic contributions and academic achievements to defend her worthiness of living in the United States because her humanity on its own would not suffice.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Right now we have the opportunity … to tell Congress that we are not taking any crumbs that only protect Dreamers like me,” Mauriz said, adding that “millions of undocumented immigrants deserve protections,” and that the premise of only helping DACA recipients because they seemed “more American” was wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mayor Jorge Elorza told The Herald that </span>defending DACA is a personal issue for him<span class="s3">. His sister was born in Guatemala and brought to the United States when she was one year old. “They didn’t call them Dreamers (then), but she was a Dreamer.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With Trump “picking on folks who can’t really stand up for themselves,” Elorza said he believes “it’s all the more important for us to stand up and speak in strong and certain terms that we’re going to look out for the people that he’s picking on.” He told The Herald that Providence will offer municipal identification cards and scholarships that are accessible to undocumented students living in Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gaspar Espinoza said he came to the rally to bring attention to the fact that Gov. Gina Raimondo had not kept her promise to pass an executive order to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/17/voters-show-support-for-driving-privileges-bill/">grant driver’s licenses</a> to the undocumented immigrants living in Rhode Island. “It’s very hypocritical of Gina Raimondo to come to all these events and say, ‘I’m here for the undocumented. I’m here for the immigrant’ when she’s capable of passing (this) executive order,” he said. The Herald previously reported that efforts to pass a proposal to give undocumented Rhode Islanders driver’s licenses stalled in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Planning the protest</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The protest was organized by Coalition of Advocates for Student Opportunities, which counts among its members Javier Juarez MA’18 and Assistant Professor of American Studies Kevin Escudero.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">CASO funds the Tam Tran scholarship named in memory of a Brown undergraduate and intended for undocumented college students in Rhode Island. Additionally, it has built a support network for undocumented students across the state, Juarez said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Juarez added that the idea to organize the protest came from a meeting that CASO held for undocumented students during the week that Trump announced his decision to roll back DACA.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Those at the meeting wondered “what are we going to do in retaliation for” this decision, he said. Having just attended an immigrants’ rights march, Juarez said he suggested holding a rally for DACA and everyone “jumped on that message.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We didn’t plan for the turnout that we got,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><em><strong>Correction: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article said that <span class="s3">Yaruska Ordinola told the crowd she was initially afraid when she heard about Trump’s decision because she believed she would “lose everything..." In fact, she told that to The Herald. The Herald regrets the error.</span></strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Kennedy Plaza to be redesigned</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Providence’s central bus hub, Kennedy Plaza, will undergo another facelift, announced Mayor Jorge Elorza on Aug. 31. The announcement comes less than three years after the last renovations of Kennedy Plaza, which cost the city $1.7 million in bond money plus a $700,000 federal grant. The city estimated the current plan would cost $5 million.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The newest redesign would consolidate the Biltmore and Burnside parks into a continuous space, introduce shaded seating and public art and eventually include a redesign of the Alex and Ani City Center ice rink to convert it into a better community gathering space.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The mayor hopes that the changes will make the plaza a place for the Providence community to grow, said press secretary Victor Morente. Morente added that public spaces are a big part of Providence’s identity.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Superintendent of the Providence Parks and Recreation Department, Wendy Nilsson, hopes that Kennedy Plaza will grow as both a local and tourist destination for New England and beyond. By combining all the smaller parks, Kennedy Plaza “will become a unified, open space, while still maintaining each smaller park’s individual identity,” Nilsson said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With deferred maintenance and volunteer work — including cleaning up park benches, light posts and railings — the new Kennedy Plaza will “make the whole area pop,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">City officials worked with local organizations, such as the Providence Downtown Neighborhood Association, to ensure everyone in the community had the opportunity to express their thoughts on the new plans. The Providence Parks and Recreation Department held seven meetings with the Downtown Neighborhood Association to “develop downtown as a type of backyard” to the community, Nilsson said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The city’s Depart of Planning and Development Department also held two workshops and community meetings where citizens could voice their opinions on the plan .</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">City planners worked with community members and Rhode Island Public Transit Authority officials to create new city bus routes, as the plans will restructure current bus routes to combine the plaza’s two parks. RIPTA’s Director of Public Affairs, Barbara Polichetti, said however that RIPTA had not yet determined the new routes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“What we do know is that (the city is) proposing two-way bus traffic on Washington Street, and that it would be (public) transit only,” as opposed to its current system, which stretches one way and allows cars to travel on it, Polichetti said. “That is what we will be looking to maximize and make most advantageous for transit.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">RIPTA said it would help the city to make its vision a reality, but its primary focus remains on providing passengers access to buses.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With the revitalization, Providence aims to create the type of community spaces seen in other American metropoles.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If you look at major cities like (New York City) and Chicago, they have one huge public area where people meet, and Kennedy Plaza very much has the potential to be (a space similar to) that,” Morente said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The city has not yet set a timeline for the Kennedy Plaza reconstruction’s completion.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Two weeks ago, Mayor Jorge Elorza unveiled the Kennedy Plaza revitalization plan — a project to develop park and community space in Kennedy Plaza, which will require the redrawing of some public transit routes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in downtown Providence. The Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority responded last night by hosting an open house to get public input as it plans its future bus routes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Kennedy Plaza is not the only project requiring route redrawing downtown. There are multiple projects the city is currently engaged in that will also affect downtown transit routes: the Downtown Transit Connector and the Providence Intermodal Transportation Center, a rebuild of the Providence Amtrak Station with room for buses. RIPTA sought input on these projects during the meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For RIPTA, these (projects) provide great opportunity for us to modify our service,” said Barbara Polichetti, director of public affairs for RIPTA. Some of the changes will include more direct service to new locations, reduction of travel times, a high-frequency transit corridor from the train station to Rhode Island Hospital and a decrease in the use of Kennedy Plaza as a transportation hub. Exactly how routes will be redrawn is still under discussion, and RIPTA is seeking public input as it undergoes the planning process. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The main goal of today is to get an idea of where people’s priorities lie in terms of our service,” RIPTA Associate Director of Planning Greg Nordin said. To do that, RIPTA posted proposed route options on boards around the room and asked attendees to vote on their preferred route options. The final routes will take into account these votes but will not be drawn solely based on them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re looking at how our service operates, if there are opportunities for new locations with our existing service and where people would like to see that occur,” Nordin said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All of the proposed routes are based on thorough analyses, said Greg Strangeways, a consultant for RIPTA from Nelson\Nygaard Consulting Associates. He said all the routes being discussed were created through market analyses, existing usage and information on transfers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There is going to be a lot more service, overall, no matter what people pick,” Strangeways said. “Residents and jobs will have more transit closer to them, and many more people will get a one seat ride, where they don’t have to transfer.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Strangeways also mentioned that part of RIPTA’s rerouting is meant to help the city reduce the transportation footprint at Kennedy Plaza because of its upcoming restructuring. “All of the service will be there, but the buses won’t have to wait there while they get back on schedule. The city wants to reuse the space and balance the transit service,” Strangeways said. He added that transportation options at the Plaza will still exist in a more streamlined capacity. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">“Our goal is to look at all of these opportunities and look at them in the light of what our passengers want,” Polichetti said. Despite changes in routes, RIPTA is committed to maintaining services for all of its passengers, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Changes will begin to take effect as early as winter 2018, but the project will not be fully completed for four to five years, Nordin said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Providence Board of Licenses called for the immediate closing of Whiskey Republic on Monday after a brawl outside of the bar turned violent, the Providence Journal reported. The Board, which dispenses and oversees liquor licenses, will hold a hearing today at 1 p.m. to discuss Whiskey’s license.</p>
<p class="p1">Early Sunday morning, six men were rushed to area hospitals — five of them stabbed, one hit by a car — after an apparently grisly altercation outside of the bar.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Police were called to the scene, just outside the Fox Point sports bar frequented by Brown and other college students, at 2:22 a.m., arriving to find three of the stabbed men and the man hit by the car all on Bridge Street, the Providence Journal reported. Police later identified two other men involved, after learning that they had checked themselves into nearby hospitals. Providence Police Lt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Luis San Lucas told the Journal that the men’s injuries are of varying severity: Some men are stable and some are in more serious conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p2">It remains unclear if the incident began outside or inside the bar, but San Lucas told the Journal that his force only witnessed and dealt with the incident outside. As of now, San Lucas does not know if anyone has been charged, but will continue to investigate the incident. They plan to make a recommendation based on their findings to the Board of Licenses by the time of today’s meeting, according to Heather Kilkenny, an administrator for the Board of Licenses, who spoke to the Journal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Providence community members have been raising concerns in meetings and various local publications about Walter Bronhard, the owner of Walter L. Bronhard Real Estate, and his handling of his properties on the East Side. Bronhard owns approximately $50 million of property in the College Hill area, <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/business/Who-Is-the-Man-Buying-Up-Providences-East-Side">according</a> to GoLocal Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recently, Bronhard came under criticism for his plan to demolish 21 Planet St., also known as the Welcome Arnold House. Because the building is located within one of the city’s local historical district, Bronhard had to apply to the Providence Historical District Commission seeking approval for demolition in May, said Jason Martin, preservation planner at the Providence Historic Commission. The commission has yet to make a decision on the demolition of the Welcome Arnold House, though discussion on the future of the house will continue Sept. 25. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Community members are upset over the potential demolition of the Welcome Arnold House due to the house’s historical significance, said Brent Runyon, president of the Providence Preservation Society. Along with being a historic house from the 18th century, the Welcome Arnold House was built by Welcome Arnold. Arnold was believed to take part in the Gaspee Affair, a ship-torching that preceded the Revolutionary War, Runyon said. Many consider Arnold a part of the founding history of both Rhode Island and the country as a whole, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Welcome Arnold House, though historic, is deteriorating in its current state due to a termite infestation, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170219/endangered-properties-owner-seeks-to-raze-historic-college-hill-house--poll">according</a> to a February 2017 article from Providence Journal. The Providence Preservation Society put the house on its “2017 Most Endangered Property List,” citing work on the house that began in 2016, but stopped abruptly. “In the following months, broken windows and doors were left unrepaired, exposing the interior to the elements,” according to the preservation society’s <a href="http://www.ppsri.org/most-endangered-properties/2017-meps">website</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the Providence Historical District Commission were to approve demolition — which is unlikely due to the high bar an owner must meet for approval — the Providence Preservation Society will try to take legal action, Runyon said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We believe that the building should be given a chance to continue its life; it holds a lot of historical significance,” Runyon said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Additionally, the Providence Preservation Society has received multiple complaints in recent years from other property owners in the neighborhood about Bronhard’s conduct, Runyon said. The property owners have voiced concerns about exterior maintenance issues and property management of Bronhard’s houses on Benefit Street, he said. The society would receive complaints about sidewalks not being shoveled during winter time, trash being everywhere and overflowing mail boxes — all of which are a landlord’s responsibility under state law, Runyon added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Concerns go beyond the historic and legal ­— tourism and the viability of local businesses could also be at stake, Runyon said. “Benefit Street is Providence’s signature historical tourist attraction, so that can have some impact on the tourism and the economy of Providence.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bronhard Real Estate has also drawn criticism from former tenants, most of whom are students in Providence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barry Nickerson, a student at Providence College, lived at 34 Benefit St. for a year. As an occupant of the house, Nickerson experienced many problems with the house, such as gas leaking from the stove, sudden increases in the water temperature which he says left scars on his body, a showerhead that was held together by duct tape, a hole in the ceiling from which animals urinated and a broken smoke alarm, he said. When he reached out to representatives from Bronhard Real Estate about these issues, Nickerson said they promised to fix the problems but never did. Though they deposited his monthly checks for rent, they were unresponsive to other letters he sent to the company detailing his concerns about 34 Benefit St. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Judy Schwarzkopf, another former tenant of Bronhard’s, said that she had to move out after five months<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>because of living conditions. Like Nickerson, Shwarzkopf experienced a gas leak in her apartment that was never fixed despite complaints to the real estate company.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Walter L. Bronhard Real Estate declined to comment or respond to the sources’ allegations despite multiple requests for comment from The Herald. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Providence elementary schools offer free meals to all students</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/14/providence-elementary-schools-offer-free-meals-students/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This year, elementary school students throughout Providence Public Schools can get a free breakfast and lunch from their cafeterias. This change comes because the city’s school board decided to take part in the Community Eligibility Provision, a federal program under the United States Department of Agriculture that provides meal service money to low-income school districts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providing children with free or reduced lunch is not something new for Providence Public Schools. Last year, the school board implemented CEP in 13 of 22 elementary schools in the district as part of a pilot program. The pilot program was successful, so the school district decided to fully implement CEP, said Laura Hart, communications director of Providence Public Schools. Before CEP, school children in Providence still had the opportunity to receive a free or reduced-price lunch if their income fell below a certain level, Hart said. CEP differs because, instead of requiring individual families to show financial need to secure free meals at school, the program evaluates school districts as a whole, which means that all students within the Providence district are covered.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite the convenience CEP can provide to school districts and students, “it is ultimately a district decision to go CEP or not,” said Megan Geoghegan, communications officer of the Rhode Island Department of Education. For this reason, some districts in Rhode Island may not participate in CEP, though they are eligible. “We, of course, want to be helpful and supportive as schools and districts find innovative ways to expand nutrition access to all students, whether that’s through CEP or other initiatives,” Geoghegan added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But it is also clear that “hungry kids don’t learn,” said Andrew Viveiros, general manager of Sodexo, the Nutrition Solutions team for Providence Public Schools. Recent studies show that hunger negatively impacts students’ ability to learn and perform well in the classroom, according to a Center for Disease Control and Prevention study. Viveiros also cited anecdotal evidence from school nurses across various districts, who told him that “the number of students complaining from headaches or stomach aches has dropped drastically because they’ve had breakfast.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If a district is eligible for the program, it can choose to opt into it. District eligibility for CEP is determined through a variety of indicators. First, at least 40 percent of enrolled students in the school district must be eligible for free school meals, according to CEP guidelines. Other indicators of eligibility are school “demographics” or “percentage of people who are getting (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits,” Hart said. Besides mitigating the effects of hunger in the classroom, CEP can serve school districts by removing the need for parents of elementary school children to fill out individual income-related paperwork, which eases the administrative burden of the free meal process, according to the CEP guidebook.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The CEP is being implemented in the city at the elementary level but not the secondary level, Hart said. At the secondary level, eligibility for a free or reduced-price lunch is still based on an individual income level. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>PawSox owners propose new stadium</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Pawtucket is home,” read the red shirts of Rhode Islanders who came out to the Senate Finance Committee Hearing Thursday to endorse the proposal for a new $83-million Pawtucket Red Sox Stadium at Slater Mill.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After the PawSox received an offer in July to make Worcester, Mass. the team’s new home, the Rhode Island community came together to review the proposal that would keep the PawSox in Pawtucket. The hearing at the Rhode Island State House is the first in a series of six that will take place through mid-October and result in a definitive conclusion regarding the construction of a “Fenway replica” in downtown Pawtucket. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Pawtucket proposal would replace the old McCoy Stadium that housed the triple-A team for the past 75 years. Both the co-owner of the PawSox Larry Lucchino and PawSox Vice-Chairman Mike Tamburro listed some key issues of sustainability with the existing publicly-owned McCoy stadium — the location is distant from the city’s urban center and the stadium faces deteriorating conditions. Built on a pond, the building is subject to mold and recurring leaks. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s been a great home, but it has done its job. … The bones are showing,” Lucchino said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maintaining the stadium is expensive, noted Pawtucket Mayor Donald Grebien. McCoy’s renovation would cost $58 million and rebuilding a new stadium on the current problematic site would increase the costs to an estimated $78 million, he said. Grebien added that even if renovated, the old McCoy stadium would not generate the same community impact as a new stadium would in a new location.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Building a new, larger stadium at Slater Mill in downtown Pawtucket will cost $83 million, of which $45 million will be invested by the PawSox — the largest private investment in downtown Pawtucket history. The state and the city of Pawtucket would split the remaining costs — $23 million and $15 million, respectively. Grebien assures the residents will face “no new taxes or tax increases” as the construction will be supported entirely by its stadium’s patrons and the PawSox team.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Co-owner Lucchino also said that “it will make Red Sox baseball sustainable and stable in Rhode Island until 2050.” The stadium’s proximity to Pawtucket’s urban center could also become a catalyst for positive redevelopment of Pawtucket, Lucchino said. Lucchino and Tamburro said they plan for the ballpark to function as a multi-purpose public space with full access for Rhode Island residents. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Andrew Maguire, a Pawtucket resident that went to the hearing, said the project would revitalize the Pawtucket community by providing a new site for events such as concerts, art festivals and farmers markets. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moreover, Mayor Jorge Elorza said the stadium would invigorate the state’s economy: “This is a great opportunity that is going to benefit all of us through creating jobs.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island Daniel J. McKee agreed, saying that the Ballpark at Slater Mill will keep “viable business in the community” and is likely to turn revenue-positive for the state of Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hearing, which lasted over four hours, gave limited time at the end for dissenters to voice their opinion. Critics have claimed that the state should not fund the stadium for a team owned by wealthy businessmen. Opponents and supporters will have a chance to be heard Sept. 26 at Tolman High School in Pawtucket. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p2">The Rhode Island General Assembly will open this Tuesday for a special legislative session, the Associated Press <a href="https://www.apnews.com/c9acd3633b6e40598b2075f5c949c7ff/Rhode-Island-lawmakers-return-to-work-in-rare-fall-session">reports</a>. Proposals on the docket include: a bill that would require employers provide paid sick leave to their workers; a potential override of Gov. Gina Raimondo’s veto of a law that would extend expired labor contracts for public employees; and a move to write certain guarantees of the Affordable Care Act into state law.</p>
<p class="p2">September sessions such as this are not typical practice at the State House: The state’s General Assembly is part-time, and typically they would not reconvene after the spring until January. But budget talks overtook the legislative agenda toward the end of the session — Tuesday’s session aims to tie up some of the loose ends left when the State House closed in June.</p>
<p class="p2">While most Rhode Island news publications describe special legislative sessions as rare, Joanne Giannini, who served as a state representative until 2010, wrote in GoLocal Providence that they actually had occurred a number of times during her 16 years in the State House. These sessions can be fruitful so long as most members of the General Assembly show up, she wrote. But legislators are not required to attend, as the session falls outside of the normal legislative calendar.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Sinclair Broadcast Group has come to Rhode Island</b></p>
<p class="p2">Sinclair Broadcast Group, a national media conglomerate that owns local Channel 10 TV news stations throughout the country, requires the Ocean State’s WJAR-TV to run pro-Trump programming on the air daily, according to the Providence <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170916/wjar-forced-to-run-pro-trump-programs">Journal</a>. Required programming includes things like the Terrorism Alert Desk, a program that runs a new story about terrorism every day, and news spots from Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump aide who is now Sinclair’s chief political analyst, the Journal reported.</p>
<p class="p2">Sinclair’s practices have sparked controversy in the state: Congressman David Cicilline ’83 told the Journal that local news should be produced in-state, not by out-of-state, national companies. The Journal also quoted a Rhode Island resident who said she had stopped watching WJAR since Sinclair bought the station and programming changed. A media columnist from the Washington Post analogized the role Fox plays for cable news to that of Sinclair for broadcast news. Sinclair Group refutes these criticisms — arguing that pre-programmed national coverage from the parent company frees in-station reporters to double down on quality local news coverage, the Journal reports.</p>
<p class="p2">Sinclair Group gained notoriety this year when John Oliver made the group the subject of an entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc">show</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Unemployment stays low in Rhode Island, but average income worst in New England</b></p>
<p class="p2">The Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training <a href="http://www.dlt.ri.gov/News_Releases/NR091417.htm">announced</a> Thursday that the state unemployment rate went unchanged in August. Within Rhode Island, 4.3 percent of the labor force is without work. The number of employed Rhode Islanders actually fell last month, but the number of people looking for jobs also fell. Overall, the number of unemployed people people has fallen this year, while the number of Rhode Island-based jobs has risen. In August in particular, private hiring offset a shrinkage in public jobs in the state.</p>
<p class="p2">But unemployment rates do not tell the full story of the Ocean State’s economy. Rhode Island still has the highest poverty rate in New England (25th in the nation), the Providence Business News <a href="https://pbn.com/report-r-highest-poverty-rate-new-england-4th-highest-median-income/">reported</a> Friday. The median income in the state is $60,596, but this average conceals a disparate reality of income inequality in the state. While White and Asian households make a median income of $63,122 and $83,610, respectively, Black households make a median income of around $42,425 and Hispanic or Latino households make a median income of $36,877.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rhode Island elected officials denounce end of DACA</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">Following President Donald Trump’s reversal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program earlier this month, Rhode Island congressmen issued statements condemning the policy change. U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., and U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., both sponsor a 2017 version of the DREAM Act, a bill they hope to bring to the House floor. The bill would be a permanent legislative solution to protect former DACA recipients, or “Dreamers,” from deportation. Similarly, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., both sponsor the Senate’s Protect Dreamer Confidentiality Act of 2017, a bill that withholds Dreamers’ private information to protect them from deportation.</p>
<p class="p4">Approximately 800,000 Dreamers are able to work and live in the United States legally under the policy, which was established in June 2012 by executive order by former president Barack Obama, after years of attempts at more expansive immigration reform stalled in Congress.</p>
<p class="p4">Trump formally ended DACA Sept. 5. But the fate of Dreamers remains uncertain, given a tentative “DACA deal” struck by congressional Democratic leaders and Trump. On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Md., announced that they and Trump had “agreed to enshrine the protections of DACA into law quickly,” in exchange for tougher border patrol. But Trump refuted the statement Thursday morning via Twitter, the New York Times reported.</p>
<p class="p4">As senior Democratic party leadership continue their negotiations, Rhode Island congressmen stand firm in their mission to protect Dreamers from deportation and produce comprehensive immigration reform.</p>
<p class="p4">The Center for American Progress estimates that there are approximately 1,229 DACA recipients in Rhode Island who annually contribute over $61 million to the state’s GDP. For these Dreamers, the confusion and uncertainty in the White House is a cause for concern. But Rhode Island policy makers are clear about the Dreamers’ role in American society: “These young people are contributing enormously to our country and are Americans in every respect other than a piece of paper,” Cicilline said. “These are people we want to be part of our country.”</p>
<p class="p4">“President Trump’s priorities are backwards. He stands behind divisive figures like Joe Arpaio, but shows no compassion for bright, hardworking kids,” Reed wrote in a statement after Trump’s executive order, adding that ending DACA would send children to “countries they have never known.”</p>
<p class="p4">“We are absolutely unified in our demand that the Speaker of the House bring the DREAM Act to the floor. That’s the easiest way to fix this problem and provide a secure future for the Dreamers,” Cicilline said.</p>
<p class="p4">Congressional Democrats are exploring every legislative possibility to pass the act, Cicilline said. He told The Herald that in the next few weeks, the Democrats could issue a discharge petition, which would force the Speaker of the House to bring a bill to vote. Other options include finding a must-pass bill that the DREAM Act can attach to or simply encouraging more Republican senators to support the DREAM Act.</p>
<p class="p4">The best approach to reform is passing comprehensive legislation that “funds proven strategies for securing our borders, while giving hardworking immigrants a way to continue contributing to our economy and communities,” wrote Meaghan McCabe, press secretary for Whitehouse, in an email to The Herald. Whitehouse has advocated for immigration reform throughout his time in Congress and, in 2013, voted for a Senate-passed bipartisan immigration reform bill that would have significantly increased border security and made it possible for undocumented immigrants to gain legal status, McCabe wrote. The bill stalled in the House.</p>
<p class="p4">Similarly, Langevin wrote in a press release that he would do “everything in (his) power to protect DACA recipients from the Administration’s cruel actions and to find a permanent legislative solution to fix our broken immigration system compassionately and effectively.”</p>
<p class="p4">Reed, Whitehouse and Langevin all voted for the DREAM Act in 2010. Cicilline was not a member of Congress at that time.</p>
<p class="p4">A debt-limit deal Trump struck with Democrats earlier this month will give the party “a lot of leverage,” said Richard Arenberg, visiting professor of political science and international and public affairs. But that deal, which lifted the debt ceiling and provided government funding, only addresses the next three months, meaning the same issues will come up again in mid-December, he added. “Addressing a legislative approach to dealing with the extension of DACA and a path to legalization and citizenship will be on the table” in those mid-December negotiations, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Were the DREAM Act brought to the floor immediately, the momentum gathering for immigration reform means “it would likely pass with all of the Democrats and enough Republican support,” Cicilline said. But the decision about whether or not to vote lies with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., which means that the process to protect Dreamers will likely be more tedious.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">The University and the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency responded Monday to the impending threat of Hurricane Jose, now expected to reach the state as a tropical storm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University warned of heavy rainfall and high winds in a community-wide email from Executive Vice President for Planning and Policy Russell Carey ’91 MA’06. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University called for members of the community to prepare by securing all office and residence hall doors and windows, ensuring that their emergency contact information is up-to-date and reviewing the University’s Hurricane Plan. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Hurricane Plan, a 16-page document designed to work alongside the University’s Emergency Management &amp; Preparedness Plan as well as its Emergency Action Plan, provides planning information and procedures to enact in the event of a hurricane. It outlines steps including the assembly of the University’s Core Crisis Committee, which convened Monday to review the plan. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We encourage all members of the Brown community to review our Hurricane Plan and to consider their own personal preparedness,” wrote Stephen Morin, director of environmental health and safety, in an email to The Herald. “We are fortunate that this storm has stayed off the coast and has diminished in strength over the past few days, but we know that there will be other storms in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University conducted its regular test of the emergency siren at noon Tuesday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency also issued a statement Monday. The agency advised locals to avoid activities on R.I. waters, particularly given that state beaches are not staffed by lifeguards after Labor Day. The press release warned of high wind, elevated surf, heavy rains and rip tides on coastal waters, which are most likely to occur along the south coast. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Downtown Providence itself is structurally prepared for Hurricane Jose. The city has not suffered from any significant flooding since 1960, when the building of the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier commenced, according to the University’s Hurricane Plan. The Hurricane Barrier obstructs high tides from Narragansett Bay and works to maintain the appropriate level of river flow. The last major hurricane that hit Providence was Hurricane Bob in 1991, which resulted in many fallen trees and an extensive loss of power. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University will provide updates to the community as the storm progresses, Carey wrote.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Investment advising committee seeks new undergraduate member</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Undergraduate Council of Students announced an open position for the Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Policies in an email to undergraduate students Sept. 12. The vacant position is for undergraduates, but the committee as a whole comprises faculty, staff, graduates, undergraduates and alums, said UCS President Chelse-Amoy Steele ’18.</p>
<p class="p2">The committee is searching for “someone who is interested in contributing to the Brown community. They don’t need to have any specific technical knowledge of investing or of any specific social issue, but it helps if they’re a person who feels passionate about social good,” said Katie Silberman, interim chair of the committee.</p>
<p class="p2">Furthermore, Silberman emphasized the time commitment for the vacant position in the committee, and said that attendance, voting and participation in discussion are required.</p>
<p class="p2">ACCRIP “is a place where any member of the community can come and bring suggestions for how the University can best align its values with its investing,” Silberman said. She added that the committee values members who are willing to speak up when they feel the University’s investment choices are causing social harm.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’ve served on many committees before, and this one has a little bit more of a global influence on Brown,” said Chi-Ming Hai, professor of medical science. He joined ACCRIP this year and is one of three professors currently sitting on the committee. Hai said he valued the broad impacts that the committee’s decisions could make. ACCRIP advises on corporate responsibility topics such as what the University’s financial stake should be in industries such as fossil fuels and coal. It also engaged in a two year dialogue with Students for Justice in Palestine about the University’s investments in Israeli companies.</p>
<p class="p2">ACCRIP has also played a role in the divestment debate on campus. The committee has recognized that the University’s financial stake in fossil fuels has a potential for “grave social harm,” and recommended the University establish a Climate Investment Task Force to look into the University’s options “for bringing Brown’s investments in line with its intellectual and social commitment to environmental sustainability.”</p>
<p class="p2">The committee also recommended that the University increase the visibility of the Brown University Sustainable Investment Fund, which focuses on sustainable investing that aligns with environmental, social and regulatory standards in order to garner more donations. The BUSIF offers donors the option to have donations invested in companies that “meet high standards of environmental, social and governance practices,” according to a January 2016 University press release.</p>
<p class="p2">The University has not divested from all environmentally damaging companies as of now, but discussion around divestment has ramped up this year with President Christina Paxson’s P’19 establishment of a climate change task force, Silberman said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every school facility in Rhode Island received a failing grade in the state’s first independent evaluation of school buildings, according to the Rhode Island Department of Education’s 2017 State of Rhode Island Schoolhouses report.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The year-long assessment commissioned by the School Building Authority and completed by Jacobs Engineering, a technical contracting firm, predicts it will take $627.6 million in construction and repairs to make the school meet current safety standards. It will take about $2.2 billion to bring schools across the state to ideal operational conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since January 2016, 306 school campuses were assessed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by architects, engineers and specialists for this evaluation. Five levels of priority costs are identified in the report: the first two are facility deficiencies with potential for building code violations, and the following three levels are more aesthetic changes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Most of our classrooms and school buildings haven’t been improved in 25 years,” Governor Raimondo said in a press release. “We must make a once-in-a-generation investment in our school buildings to address immediate health and safety needs in every district and to give our children the 21st century classrooms they need to compete in the world today.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The quality of a school’s design and the amount of funding the state provides for it reflects “the priority we place on quality learning environments,” said Hanna Gallo, education committee chairwoman for the R.I. Senate and the senate’s appointee to the School Building Task Force. “Children can’t reach their potential in cold classrooms or under leaky roofs.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In conjunction with the report, Raimondo signed an executive order Sept. 15 creating a new commission, the Rhode Island Schools Task Force, which will develop action steps based on the report and public input. The task force is comprised of legislators, community advocates and school professionals and is co-chaired by RIDE Commissioner Ken Wagner and State Treasurer Seth Magaziner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The task force plans to turn the action steps to the governor<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in December.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“RIDE will continue to support districts in their efforts to modernize and improve school infrastructure, with a renewed emphasis on projects that have emerged as most urgently needed for the safety, well-being and success of our students,” Wagner said in a press release.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We know where the report stands,” said Catherine Rolfe, deputy press secretary for the governor. “It’s clear we need a once in a lifetime investment, but we need to figure out where we can find the money.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next step for the state is public engagement, said Meg Geoghegan, communications officer for the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. In technical briefings, RIDE will consult with experts about the details of the report. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raimondo will hold a series of community forums in October to solicit feedback from communities across Rhode Island. This, in conjunction with RIDE’s technical briefings, will help Raimondo define investment priorities in school facilities renovation, before proposing her budget for 2019. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raimondo will also embark on a walking tour where she plans to talks to educators, parents and students about school facilities. On Wednesday, Raimondo visited East Providence High School, an example of a school whose facilities have potential but lack sufficient funding, Rolfe said, citing a large swimming pool at the school that has remained empty for six years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In some towns, implementation of Raimondo’s plan will be primarily state-led, but, in Providence, implementation will look different. The city of Providence owns the Providence Public School's buildings, therefore any renovations to Providence schools will have to be a collaborative solution between the city and the district, said Laura Hart, director of communication for Providence Public Schools. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Prior to the report coming out this was already a priority for the city of Providence, and they were looking for solutions,” Hart said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At last April’s All In Summit, a city event hosted by Mayor Jorge Elorza that focused on bettering Providence schools, school infrastructure improvements were identified as one of the highest priorities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The majority of Providence Public School buildings require significant attention and investment to meet the educational needs of our students,” wrote Christopher Maher, superintendent of Providence Public Schools, in an email to The Herald. According to the state’s report, the schools most in need in Providence are Hope High School, Mount Pleasant High School and Classical High School; the bulk of money for improvements needed throughout Providence will go toward priority two and three renovations. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elorza announced in August that the city plans to dedicate at least $400 million toward repairs for Providence schools, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170828/providence-mayor-pledges-to-spend-up-to-400m-on-school-repairs">reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The Mayor is committed to addressing this issue at the city level and took a step in addressing this issue by looking at options for the city and launching a community centered planning process for these investments that will rely on input from educators, students and parents,” wrote Victor Morente, press secretary for Elorza, in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The city is eligible to borrow $400 million over the next decade for school improvements, Morente wrote. “The mayor also committed to exploring and leveraging public and private partnerships to maximize every dollar invested in schools,” Morente wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the Providence Public School system owns its own buildings, therefore any renovations to Providence schools will have to be a collaborative solution between the state and the district. In fact, the city of Providence owns the Providence Public School buildings, thus any renovation must be a collaboration between the city and the district. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Jabberwocks target of larceny in Wayland House North</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Sept. 9 around 6:15 p.m., two Jabberwocks reported their cashbox — which contained $350, a Jabberwocks banner and miscellany — had been taken. Most of the items were later found, but the Jabberwocks banner, which is worth approximately $50, is still missing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Bike larceny outside Champlin Hall</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Sept. 11, a student reported her teal blue 21-speed Hybrid Mountain Bike, which is worth approximately $400, missing from the bicycle rack where she had left it. She reported the bike missing around 11 a.m.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Another bike larceny outside Life Science Building</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Also on Sept. 11, another student contacted the Department of Public Safety<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>around 3 p.m. when she returned to the bicycle rack outside the Life Science Building to find that her black Felt Road Bike, which had red highlights and “FELT” spelled out in white lettering, was gone.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Yet another bike larceny outside Champlin Hall</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just before 6 p.m. on Sept. 11, a bike thief struck outside Champlin Hall. This time, a blue and gray Trek Hybrid Bike had been stolen from its position at the bike rack outside the dorm. This bike was worth approximately $500. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As they walked into the hidden church dome, the visitors could spot some of the names inscribed on the wall, some dating back to the early 18th century.</p>
<p class="p2">“Providence is amazing in the richness of its architecture,” said Matthew Hird, the church’s steward.</p>
<p class="p2">This tour of the Beneficent Congregational Church was just one of over 20 unique locations open to the public during the Doors Open Rhode Island festival on Saturday. During the festival, curious visitors could explore historic museums, cathedrals, theaters and studios located across Providence for free.</p>
<p class="p2">The tour featured several buildings located on campus and the Rhode Island School of Design. Others were within walking distance or easily accessible through the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, which provided free transportation between participating sites on the day of the festival.</p>
<p class="p2">In some of the sites, like the Stephen Hopkins House, participants were led on guided tours with special access to 18th-century artifacts and heirlooms. In other places, like the Benefit Street Arsenal, visitors were allowed to freely explore the military collections of the Providence Marine Corps of Artillery, including a large Model 1902 Field Gun.</p>
<p class="p2">The Doors Open Festival is part of a wider movement, which aims to connect people with the significant spaces in their city. “When we have access to places in our community, we learn the stories that make us feel more connected to the cities, which contributes to our greater sense of ownership and pride,” said Caroline Stevens MA’16, the festival’s program director. Stevens started the Doors Open venture as a recipient of the 2016 Embark Post-Graduate Fellowship, a program sponsored by the Swearer Center for Public Service that provides grants around $20,000 to graduating students pursuing “social ventures as full-time endeavors.”</p>
<p class="p2">Those who attended and volunteered at the festival seemed to do so out of genuine curiosity, wanting to know more about the landmarks that they pass by on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="p2">“I went to the Benefit Street Arsenal,” said Jen Liu ’17, “I actually live one minute away from it. I had no idea that any of these places … were historical.”</p>
<p class="p2">Glenn Doup, senior vice commander of the American Legion Post 228 in Somerset, Mass., eyed fragile collections at the Benefit Street Arsenal, including some volumes that date back to 1865. “I think it’s a great place, a beautiful place,” he said. “And now that they’ve finally done all these renovations to it, I’m glad I got a chance to come out.”</p>

		<title>University, Pokanoket agree to create land trust</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The University and the Pokanoket Nation reached an agreement Sept. 21 to put a portion of the Bristol land in a preservation trust, wrote Russell Carey ’91 MA’06, executive vice president for planning and policy, in a community-wide email on Monday. The trust will be accessible not only to the Pokanoket Nation, but also to other tribes with historical claims to the land, <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/09/agreement">according to the agreement</a>. The University made its announcement after confirming that the Pokanoket Nation cleared their over month-long encampment as part of the agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The exact portion of the Bristol land that will be transferred into the trust will be determined by a cultural resources survey, which will be led by a firm hired and funded by the University, Carey told The Herald. The Pokanoket Nation will be able to determine the governance and structure of the trust after its discussions with “other tribes with a historical interest in this land,” according to the agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The agreement was signed after four in-person meetings between Pokanoket representatives and Brown representatives Carey, Deputy Provost Joseph Meisel, Director of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology Robert Preucel and the University’s legal counsel. Two meetings were on the Bristol lands and two were at the School of Professional Studies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So far, two sacred sites that will be part of the trust have been identified. The first is the location where Chief Metacom — also known as King Philip — was killed, and the second is where he held tribal council meetings, Carey said. The cultural resources survey and the search for organizations with the appropriate historical and anthropological expertise will begin soon, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The cultural resources survey will require input “from all parties with a historical interest in the land,” and these parties will also be given “full and transparent access to … survey output before any final determinations are made,” according to the agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University has acknowledged that the people of the Pokanoket Nation, who have historical ownership of the Mount Hope lands on the Bristol property, have been “dispersed among many tribes” and “aboriginal peoples of New England” other than the “present-day Pokanoket Tribe,” according to the agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Pokanoket dispersal began during King Philip’s War in the 1670s, when Pokanoket identity was criminalized and punishable by death, said Sagamore Po Wauipi Neimpaug of the Pokanoket Nation, The Herald previously reported.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If necessary, the University “is willing to help identify and support a mediator to assist in facilitating an agreement among the parties” who have claims to the Bristol land as they select the governance and organizational structure of the preservation trust. Such relevant parties include the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah), the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and the Assonet Band of the Wampanoag Nation and others, according to the agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to the cultural resources survey, the University will fund a land survey, a standard procedure for drawing the new boundaries that will be established between the land in the trust and the land to be kept by the University, Carey said. According to the agreement, “the University has already reached out to a land surveyor to discuss the commencement” of such a survey.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the agreement, the University outlined its commitment to the conservation of the Bristol land by ensuring “appropriate stewardship” as well as appropriate management, as the Bristol property is a “unique historical, sacred and natural resource.” The lands in the trust will be prevented from sale or future development, Carey said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bristol property currently owned by the University is about 375 acres, according to an earlier press release. The Haffenreffer Museum’s Collections Research Center and a multipurpose center used for summer programs and environmental research currently sit on the land, according the agreement. This land was donated to the University by the Haffenreffer family in the 1950s.</span></p>
<p class="p4">According to an online statement by Neesu Wushuwunoag,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>director general of the Federation of Aboriginal Nations of America, this Bristol land was originally transferred from the Pokanoket Nation to the Plymouth Colony in 1680 in an unlawful “by Turf and by Twig” transfer ceremony. Following the beheading of Metacom, Plymouth representative James Ingrahm presented a snapped twig from a tree and “a clod of dirt” from this land to declare to colonial proprietors his ownership, according to the statement.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Sagamore of the Pokanoket will publish a statement on the Po Metacom Camp Facebook page soon, said Wushuwunoag, who declined to comment on the agreement until the statement is released.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rhode Island Senate meets for special session</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Though the State House does not regularly meet in September as a part-time General Assembly, a legislative session of the Rhode Island General Assembly was held last Tuesday to resume issues left unaddressed in June, when legislative talks were diverted to discussions of budget. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This session saw a number of significant bills passed, including one regarding paid sick leave, a gun safety measure aimed at protecting victims of domestic violence, as well as modifications of the probation and parole system.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sick leave bill, sponsored by Sen. Maryellen Goodwin, D-Providence, and Rep. Aaron Regunberg ’12, D-Providence, passed in both chambers. This bill will provide paid sick time to Rhode Island employees. It also aims to ensure that employees will be able to take off time to care for their personal well-being, as well as their families, without fear of monetary repercussions. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This bill protects all Rhode Islanders in terms of public health and providing for their families. It means working people — especially those in lower-wage positions that lack benefits — will finally have the ability to take care of themselves or their families when they are sick,” Goodwin said in a press release. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Paid sick leave will be an option to over 90 percent of Rhode Island employees, and violating employers will be subject to fines between $100 and $500 for every day that they’re found to be in violation of the legislation, according to the press release. Regunburg said, “with this legislation, we’ve got an opportunity to make a concrete, positive impact on over a hundred thousand Rhode Island workers.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The bill is planned to come into action July 2018 and will provide those eligible with three earned sick days in a year. Gradually, this number will be phased up to five sick days, which will take effect in 2020, according to the press release. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some legislators raised questions, however, regarding the financial efficiency of this approach. “We are killing businesses,” Rep. Michael Chippendale, R-Foster, Coventry and Glocester, said, after commenting that the move would negatively affect him as a business owner.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rep. Teresa Tanzi ’07, D-Narragensett and South Kingstown, and Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, sponsored legislation that focuses on protecting victims of domestic violence by prohibiting<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>offenses as well as those who have received court-issued final protective orders from possessing guns, according to a press release. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tanzi called the bill a “life-saving piece of legislation,” adding that “this bill will help keep victims of domestic violence safe by keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A victim of domestic violence is under more risk when their abuser is in possession of a firearm, according to the press release. The bill implements measures to ensure that abusers are not only prohibited from owning firearms, but also required to turn their existing weapons in.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rep. Patricia Morgan, R-Coventry, Warwick and West Warwick, who opposed the bill, said she disagreed with the bill regarding the Second Amendment, noting that the bill would be infringing on a citizen’s constitutional right to bear arms. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There were also six bills passed to modify Rhode Island’s systems of probation and parole. According to a press release, the bills were part of a package presented by Gov. Gina Raimondo’s Justice Reinvestment Working Group, which is charged with overhauling Rhode Island’s criminal justice system in a manner “that would relieve pressures from the correctional system while increasing public safety.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the bills passed will create a “batterer’s intervention program fund,” while another will expand the maximum compensation allotted to victims of crimes. The package will also modify sentencing and execution guidelines for criminal procedures, create a diversion program that allows for defendants to undergo substance abuse screening as well as counseling and clarify the definitions of specific crimes under general laws. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sen. Michael McCaffrey, D-Warwick, a sponsor of these bills, called the package “a collective effort to modernize Rhode Island’s broken criminal justice system.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A host of other issues were discussed during the session. Amongst other bills that passed was a bill that prohibits smoking e-cigarettes in schools and puts in place more packaging rules, one that aims to ban dangerous chemicals in some furniture products and a bill that accelerates animal adoptions.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A package of six bills meant to reform the parole and probation system in Rhode Island officially passed in the R.I. General Assembly last week. The legislation “overwhelmingly” passed in the State Senate in June and in the House last week, said State Rep. Robert Craven, D-North Kingstown. Craven, a sponsor of three of the bills, discussed the legislation’s aim to minimize recidivism and save taxpayer money.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The state spends more than $70,000 a year incarcerating a single individual, Craven said. “More than 90 percent of the people that go to jail in Rhode Island don’t go to jail as a result of a trial and conviction<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— they go to jail as a result of being on probation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Ocean State has one of the highest probation rates in the country, second only to Georgia. With approximately 24,400 offenders under adult probation and parole and 8,400 under active supervision, Rhode Island’s probation rate is 91 percent higher than the national average, according to National Institute of Corrections’ 2015 statistics. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The legislative package offers a better set of post-conviction and pre-conviction services, Craven said. While crafting the legislation, those in the Assembly with background in criminal defense law consulted with a variety of stakeholders, including the public defender’s office, the attorney general’s office, the National Assocation for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Civil Rights Roundtable, said State Rep. Edith Ajello, D-Providence, who also introduced the legislation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Often, those on probation will go on to commit very “minimal” actions that rise “to the level of failing to keep the peace and good behavior,” and, consequently, those offenders return to jail again and again, Craven said. By shifting focus from jail time to rehabilitation, the state can save tax revenue: Every convicted individual that does not return to jail saves money for the state. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Eighty percent of the people in the district court coming through the door are there directly or indirectly as a result of mental illness, drugs or alcohol, and, if you can solve those problems, (they are) far less likely to come back,” Craven said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Vanessa Flores-Maldonado ’14, campaign coordinator for the Providence Community-Police Relations Act — an ordinance passed in order to reform police-community relations and prohibit racial profiling — said that mental health programs are salient in combating criminal activity.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It is important to address mental health issues and how they come into play especially in the criminal justice system,” Flores-Maldonado said. If individuals “had the proper mental health resources, then they probably wouldn’t find themselves in the situations that they are currently in,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the six bills in the package — the Act Relating to Criminal Procedure, Sentence and Execution — would change several sentencing and execution guidelines, including new conditions of probation. For instance, when a person violates the terms and conditions of probation as deemed by the court, they will have the chance to appeal. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before the six bills were passed, there was no way to appeal a violation, Ajello said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Additionally, Ajello said she supported one of the bills that will reduce the maximum sentence for certain felony assault crimes from 20 years to six years. Attorney General Peter Kilmartin was opposed to this part of the legislation, and it ultimately caused him not to support the package as a whole, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“The Attorney General urged (Governor Gina Raimondo) to veto (the package), making statements that these people are not being punished for serious crimes,” Ajello said. Some could see this as unfair to the vicitims of assault crimes — but, under the new law, prosecutors could still bring multiple charges against alleged perpetrators in order to up their potential sentences, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Ajello said that a lot of defendants faced with a package of charges often plead to one of the charges in order to start serving their time and get back into the community quicker but in doing so, defendants can end up agreeing to “a really long probationary period.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“Defendants, in many cases, don’t have the money to pay a lawyer to defend them in court, so they end up making these pleas,” Ajello said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Another part of the legislation includes new methods in identifying candidates for rehabilitation in diversion courts. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“The diversion court is a method by which people are identified right after they are being charged in their first contact with the court system as being people suffering from mental, drug and alcohol abuse,” Craven said. “And if appropriately presented as a candidate, they would be diverted from the typical path in the criminal justice court system to a diversion court,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">In turn, the diversion court will work with offenders to supply counseling, supervision and drug testing for a minimum of six to 12 months, Craven said, adding that the court itself will<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ultimately decide how it is run. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Past the legislative stage, there will be challenges in implementing the new bills, Flores-Maldonado said, specifically the need for proper resources and training within police departments. Police officers must be trained to handle individuals with mental illnesses, she said, pointing to instances of police officers pulling their weapons on individuals experiencing panic attacks.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“I don’t think any cop really knows what to do when a person is having a mental breakdown other than ‘we should throw you into jail and see if that calms you down.’ This is an issue that needs to be looked at from different angles not just within the jail system,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The adult correctional institution will implement the changes in probation and parole, Craven said, while the courts will implement the changes to the rules of criminal procedures and sentencing guidelines for certain types of crimes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“It is important to look at the whole chain of how someone ends up in prison from the very beginning,” Flores-Maldonado said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Two individuals filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Lifespan Corporation, a healthcare conglomerate in Rhode Island and the University’s primary clinical training partner, that alleges a lack of interpreters within Lifespan’s subsidiary hospitals. Without interpreters, deaf individuals were left unable to communicate with medical professionals about the urgent healthcare needs of their children, according to the lawsuit. The National Association of the Deaf, Rhode Island Disability Law Center and Eisenberg &amp; Baum, LLP filed the suit on behalf of the two plaintiffs and the Rhode Island Association of the Deaf<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sept. 6. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to the lawsuit, Lifespan violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by not providing on-site sign language interpreter services at the Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital, the pediatric division of Rhode Island Hospital. The plaintiffs both use American Sign Language as their primary means of communication and assert that Lifespan discriminated against them by not providing interpreters. The discrimination left the plaintiffs unable to clearly communicate with doctors and healthcare professionals about the treatment of their children, which included blood transfusions, surgery and psychiatric treatment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the suit, one plaintiff claims she has been unable to receive clear communication about her son’s life threatening medical conditions since 2014. The second plaintiff makes similar claims, alleging that she could not communicate clearly with hospital staff about her son or husband’s medical needs. In both cases, instead of providing on-site interpreter services to facilitate communication, Hasbro used Video Remote Interpreting, a remote service cart that video calls interpreters, but this service was largely ineffective, according to court documents.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The plaintiffs ask the court to require Lifespan to provide and pay for qualified healthcare interpreters and have Lifespan staff trained on the rights of deaf patients.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We filed this lawsuit to bring attention to the very important need to ensure that deaf and hard of hearing individuals have the same access to healthcare” that all individuals are entitled to, said Caroline Jackson, a staff attorney for the National Association of the Deaf Law and Advocacy Center. “The laws we are enforcing have been on the books since 1973 and 1990, respectively,” and The National Association of the Deaf has seen many similar cases of lack of provisions for necessary medical communication, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990, hospitals in Rhode Island have neglected deaf patients by providing inadequate access to accommodations which infringe on Deaf individuals’ basic human rights,” said Todd Murano, acting president of the Rhode Island Association of the Deaf, in a press release.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lifespan failed to take the necessary steps to provide effective communication and have violated federal requirements, Jackson said. “When someone is deaf or hard of hearing, and they primarily use sign language to communicate,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>… then it means providing a qualified sign language interpreter so they can … have a real chat with doctors and nurses,” Jackson said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“A lot of hospitals try to do video interpreting services where they bring in a cart that has a camera on it and they call a remote interpreter, who listens and tries to interpret what’s in the room,” said Tim Riker, lecturer of language studies. But the video interpreting services “aren’t reliable, people who use it aren’t trained, the Internet can be choppy and the patient might not be able to see the screen if they are incapacitated due to their condition. They need a live person in the room to interpret,” he said. “A doctor refusing an interpreter is forcing a patient to accept a lack of communication.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Accurate communication is also necessary for successful care, wrote Hayley Jamroz Baccaire, president of the Rhode Island Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Personalized care is essential and can be rendered with the greatest outcome by working with licensed interpreters who are on-site,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There is a lack of interpreters overall in the state, according to multiple sources. This is correlated to the lack of training programs for interpreters and low levels of retention, Riker said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“One way to solve the problem is to create full-time staff positions,” Riker said. Large hospitals can hire several full-time interpreters to travel between hospitals in the state, Riker said, adding that this “might help a little of the retention rate of interpreters if it’s a full-time position with benefits.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island Disability Law Center has received many complaints about lack of interpreter services in Rhode Island, particularly after the press following this suit, said Kate Bowden, staff attorney for the Rhode Island Disability Law Center. “We think this is an important case because all parents should have the ability to speak and communicate with doctors about the care of their children and loved ones. This level of communication is required by law,” Bowden said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children’s Hospital “are committed to providing family-centered care for all patients,” David Levesque, director of communications for Lifespan wrote in an email to The Herald. Lifespan declined to comment on the lawsuit. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The suit is still in its initial stages, and the plaintiffs will not hear an answer or a motion to dismiss from Lifespan until the middle of October, Jackson said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>TEDxProvidence brings R.I. stories to public</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/01/tedxprovidence-brings-r-stories-public/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following the theme of “Past, Present and Future,” 16 of Rhode Island’s leaders and innovators shared their stories at the TEDxProvidence event, held at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium Saturday, Sept. 30. The event has been held at Rhode Island School of Design’s Metcalf Auditorium in past years, but, this year, TEDxProvidence made the move to the Veterans Memorial, an ornate venue with expansive seating. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">TEDx is an offshoot of TED, a media organization dedicated to “spreading ideas” through short and meaningful lectures. TEDx has the same mission as TED but is independently organized. This is TEDxProvidence’s sixth year in action. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Other than the company’s signature speeches, the event included videos from TED’s website and performances from the Eastern Medicine Singers, Call Security and Case Closed!, which are all Rhode Island-based music and dance groups. The conference was segmented into three sessions and ran from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Attendees were enthusiastic to learn from the speakers’ life stories. “This is really an amazing opportunity to be exposed to new learning opportunities and to have this dialogue that doesn’t necessarily exist outside of here yet, unfortunately,” said Steven Smith, an audience member who became interested in TED talks three years ago. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The success of TEDxProvidence is in part due to its diverse lineup of speakers. In a single session, attendees listened to Paul Salem ’85, who narrowly avoided death on Pan Am Flight 103; Shawndell Burney-Speaks, a former intervention specialist for the Providence school system; Cheryl Snead, founder of Banneker Industries and Dr. Raymond Mis, a legally blind, board certified gastroenterologist. In each talk, speakers honed in on the importance of persistence, optimism and understanding.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Believing that you’re lucky is the most important thing you can have in life,” Salem said. Salem’s father told him that “he was born under a lucky star,” and this idea eventually came to define Salem’s outlook in life. This mindset not only made him take more chances but also allowed him to persist through periods of temporary failure — like when he applied and was rejected from “a thousand jobs.” He is now the co-founder and senior managing director of Providence Equity Partners. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This theme of perseverance came up in other talks. “If there’s an obstacle or challenge, I know there’s a way over it, under it and through it,” Snead said, the first African-American female to graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Talks also delved into personal stories and desires for change within Providence. “My dream is to attend more graduation ceremonies, weddings and award ceremonies — not funerals and jailhouse visits of the young,” Burney-Speaks said, whose son was murdered in a fatal shooting in Providence earlier this year. Children in Providence need stronger support networks — kids can only thrive when they have positive role models in their lives to mentor them, she said, adding that investing in education would be one of the first steps toward achieving this in Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Attendees were enthused by the talks they went to throughout the day. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The performer that I really liked was Christopher Johnson,” said Florence “FloJo” Badejo, a doctoral candidate in pharmacy at the University of Rhode Island. “His spoken word pieces were very inspiring. He had the whole crowd going. You couldn’t sit in that room and not be enthralled by what he had to say and how he had to say it.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I was just over the moon,” said Darien Strassfield, another student at URI.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">From the thunderous applause and bustling conversation at the end of the event, there seemed to be inspiration for everyone at TEDxProvidence.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Convicted domestic abusers in Rhode Island will be restricted from owning firearms once the Protect Rhode Island Families Act is signed by Gov. Gina Raimondo this week. By implementing more restrictive measures for gun owners convicted of domestic violence, Rhode Island now joins 27 other states and Washington, D.C. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The bill, sponsored by state Rep. Teresa Tanzi, D-Narragansett, and Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, was passed Sept. 19 in the House with 58 yes votes and the Senate with 33 yes votes. The bill was initially introduced three years ago by Tanzi, but the proposal was defeated at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“It sounds like common sense legislation, but each year we found that it hit roadblocks and had obstacles from different perspectives in the legislature,” said Deborah DeBare, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence. “So this year we were really pleased to see a revised version of the bill come out that had support from both the House leadership and the Senate leadership.”</span></p>
[infogram id="9ffb8760-0250-4820-ac97-e89309c307f8" prefix="r56" format="interactive" title="States with domestic violence gun laws"]
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Different groups — such as the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence, as well as a large religious coalition — all advocated for the legislation by attending hearings, publishing papers, lobbying the state house, writing letters and meeting with officials.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Though federal law already restricts domestic abusers from possessing firearms, there was no state-level enforcement in Rhode Island. Tanzi cited a comprehensive study by Everytown for Gun Safety that reviewed three years’ worth of protective orders throughout Rhode Island and found that the courts only issued for firearms to be surrendered 13 percent of the time, despite complainants specifically indicating that people’s lives had been threatened with use of their spouse’s gun.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This legislation closes the state-level loophole by requiring that persons convicted of domestic violence and under restraining orders forfeit any guns in their possession within 24 hours. The guns are first to be transferred to a licensed firearms dealer before a third party — who can neither be a relative of the prohibited person nor someone residing in the same household — assumes responsibility of the firearms.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Prohibited persons could collect their guns upon completing their sentence or when their restraining orders are lifted, but the bill imposes severe penalties on persons who manage to take their guns back before their prohibition period is over.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We know that easy access to a gun for domestic abusers can put the victim in an extremely dangerous situation,” said Jennifer Boylan, a volunteer leader of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. “We know that (in) states … where domestic abusers do not have easy access to guns, there’s lower instances of domestic violence shootings and homicides. So we know these laws work.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">According to the study conducted by Everytown, the risk of homicide is increased five-fold when an abuser has access to a firearm. In Rhode Island specifically, the study found that 28 percent of women who were killed by their partners between 2008 to 2012 were shot to death.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Before the bill was passed, the National Rifle Association issued a statement in June: “Anti-gun groups have co-opted domestic violence organizations simply to notch a victory that they can use as momentum for their larger gun ban agenda.” The statement called on Rhode Island gun owners to push their legislators to oppose the bill.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“The Second Amendment folks and the NRA folks were worried that this was just a superficial attempt to have people’s guns taken away. And it really was not the case,” said Tanzi. “It was 100 percent data-driven, and it had nothing to do with taking guns away from law-abiding, responsible gun owners.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“What we have seen is many, many states over the past 10 years have strengthened laws against domestic abusers,” said Adam Winkler, professor of constitutional law at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. “And, in fact, it’s been the kind of restrictive gun law that’s even been adopted in states that are quite hostile to gun control as a general matter.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Rhode Island’s March for Racial Justice, one of the 18 marches that took place across the nation this weekend, kicked off at India Point Park Sunday afternoon with about 450 people.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island march featured 14 speakers, who highlighted both state-specific and national issues regarding race and equality, such as gentrification in Providence, mass incarceration, police brutality and LGBTQ+ rights. The speakers included State Rep. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell, D-Providence, and City Councilwoman Nirva LaFortune GS.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The point of this day is to lift the movement for black lives and platform points that are already being worked on within the community, and a call for action to the things that have yet to be addressed,” said Adria Marchetti, head organizer of the Rhode Island march.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I am black, once undocumented. I’m an immigrant, mother of a black son and daughter, and my life matters,” LaFortune said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ranglin-Vassell spoke about the meaning of her position as the only black woman in the Rhode Island General Assembly and the need to elect black representatives. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We got to (President) Trump because of racism,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ranglin-Vassell also mentioned her plans to reintroduce a bill calling for the reduction of out-of-school suspensions, which she said disproportionately affect students of color and is part of the systematic prison complex that is subsidized on “the backs of black and brown people.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island march was organized in conjunction with 20 partners and five local campaigns, including the Direct Action for Rights and Equality, FANG Collective and RI NOW, all of whom are “working at the intersection of race, class, ability, gender, sexuality and environment,” according to the march’s website. The march was dotted with several booths, including a Rhode Island voter registration table. Another booth urged the end of Rhode Island public schools’ “lunch shaming” in which students without enough money for lunch are provided with more cheaply produced meals — efforts akin to a bill introduced by Ranglin-Vassell in April.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The march was supported by an online crowdfunding campaign that raised $2,040, as well as $101 from apparel sales.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A family zone was set up with Play-Doh and crayons to accommodate families with young children. This was the first time Janie Segui, who frequents such rallies, has seen a family zone, she told The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After observing that the march was “majority white people,” attendee Linda Heng said, “I would love to see more of my community show up,” such as Southeast Asian people and other minority groups, “but we’re not the majority that’s here.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The national and local marches were originally planned to take place on Saturday, the last day of Yom Kippur, a holiday when observant Jews fast and refrain from work. The Rhode Island march was postponed to Sunday. The organizers apologized in an online statement and acknowledged that they had “made a gross underestimation, due to ignorance, of the practices and significance of this holy day.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rhode Island Governor urges women to engage in politics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo encouraged students — and women in particular — to participate in the political process during a discussion hosted by the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs Tuesday evening. She also voiced a keen interest in incentivizing University students to remain in Rhode Island post-graduation.</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo discussed political involvement and her political leadership in Rhode Island during a conversation moderated by Cathy Russell, former U.S. ambassador at-large for global women’s issues. Students and faculty, as well as University and Providence community members, attended the event in the Metcalf Research Building.</p>
<p class="p4">One of only six female governors in the country, Raimondo told The Herald “it’s very challenging to be a female chief executive, particularly in the public sector.”</p>
<p class="p4">While Raimondo knew before running for office that few women hold positions of power in politics, “it’s surprising to live it,” she said. Women succeed to the same degree as men in school, but once they reach the business or political world, female participation drops, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">Both Raimondo and Russell said that women need to take more prominent roles in top positions. “It’s really important to get in the game and stay in the game,” Raimondo said, adding that women will only enter government if they see other women leading and taking risks.</p>
<p class="p4">“You make better decisions if you’re surrounded by a diverse group of people,” Raimondo told The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">“I would have loved for her to be a little bit more intersectional with some of the topics she discussed. As a woman of color, those red flags …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>stick up to me,” said Alisha Thompson, research fellow at The Swearer Center for Public Service who attended the talk. “She’s a great speaker, and she’s doing more than other governors do.”</p>
<p class="p4">Students need to participate in the political process, Raimondo said, even though “it’s easy to be so frustrated. … Lots of us are angry with what we’re seeing in the political world.”</p>
<p class="p4">“No one has the luxury of sitting on the sideline,” Russell said.</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo also discussed her frustration with <span class="s3">President Trump and the effects of his presidency on state governments. “What I see in Washington is a lack of leadership. … So, it’s incumbent upon governors to make up for that lack,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For example, Raimondo initiated an effort to fund the payment of renewal fees for Rhode Island residents who are part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as The Herald<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/19/governor-gina-raimondo-announces-initiative-fund-daca-application-fees/"> previously reported</a>. “I don’t think it’s a good change,” Raimondo said about states needing to take action where the federal government has not. “I have one million people depending on me to do my job,” she said, adding that pushing federal issues to the state level “is not a sustainable situation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo also addressed the state economy in her discussion. “I’ve taken over a state that needs a lot of help. … By a lot of measures, we’ve been stuck for 20 years,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I can’t build a great economy without talent,” she said, adding that she would love for University students to work and live in Rhode Island after graduation, a theme she repeated throughout the hour-long talk. Students who remain in the state and work in fields related to science, technology, engineering, math and art are eligible for the Wavemaker fellowship, which provides a financial incentive to stay, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo often works with the University on economic development projects, including the recent Wexford Innovation Center, she <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/25/wexford-innovation-center-breaks-ground/">said</a>. “I’ve been able to recruit GE Digital, Johnson and Johnson (and others),” she said. “All those companies are coming here for our talent. … I leverage Brown, and our other universities, to bring these companies here.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Javier Juarez MA’18 praised Raimondo’s work as governor. Juarez, who has spoken with the governor in the past, cited his admiration for her efforts to make college more affordable. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo recently signed into law a bill that makes tuition free for all in-state residents who attend the Community College of Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“She came through, so that’s why I came here to support her,” Juarez said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo also answered questions during the talk. In the current media environment, the governor’s office relies more on social media and Facebook than traditional journalism, Raimondo said when asked about the relationship between politics and the media by Edward Steinfeld, director of the Watson Institute. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s almost impossible to get the news out,” she said, adding that the Providence Journal “is a shadow of its former self.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo also answered student questions on a variety of her recent actions as governor. Earlier this year, Raimondo hired the state’s first ever food “czar,” whom she tasked with creating a statewide food policy. The new policy supports local farms, creates training opportunities for aging industries like commercial fishing and encourages restaurants, large companies and even the University to buy local foods, Raimondo said. “This is what happens if you have an Italian governor: a premium focus on fo</span>od,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">At Thursday’s Providence City Council meeting, which lasted for less than 20 minutes, the city passed ordinances about the Providence Water Supply Board and a resolution calling for the enforcement of restrictions on early morning waste collection.</p>
<p class="p4">Councilman David Salvatore’s resolution calling to enforce restrictions on early morning waste collection passed. Salvatore said that trash pick-up is too early, and city council members received complaints from the constituents about this issue. “Waste management was in their neighborhoods sometimes at 4:30 in the morning and it is too early to hear the trucks,” said Salvatore.</p>
<p class="p4">Thirteen ordinances relating to the Providence Water Supply Board passed all at once. “The water rates are approved by the public utilities commission, so while it is independent from the city, there are still ordinances that the city council has to vet and approve because the city is the owner of the water supply,” Councilman David Salvatore told The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">A resolution calling for the repair of the Public Safety Complex, which was introduced by Councilmen Luis Aponte and John J. Igliozzi passed.</p>
<p class="p4">There were also resolutions which were referred to different committees.</p>
<p class="p4">A resolution introduced by Councilwoman Carmen Castillo requesting the Traffic Engineer to install a taxi stand on Fulton Street between Dorrance Street and Eddy Street after 9 p.m. and before 8 a.m. was referred to the Department of the Public Works committee. Castillo called the council to support the taxi drivers who are financially affected by the prevalence of Uber and other car-sharing services.</p>
<p class="p4">A resolution designating the intersection of Smith Street and Chalkstone Avenue as “Guy Alba Square” was referred to the Urban Renewal and Redevelopment committee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bill restricting sex offenders in homeless shelters passes Rhode Island House, Senate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Last month, a bill that would cap the proportion of registered sex offenders in homeless shelter beds at 10 percent for shelters whose capacity exceeds 50 people passed in the Rhode Island State House. A coalition of activists are now asking via petition that Gov. Gina Raimondo veto the bill, arguing that the legislation is “against the public interest.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The bill passed the state Senate in June after the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended it for passage. The bill was passed in concurrence by the Rhode Island House of Representatives Sept. 19, and the veto petition was sent to Raimondo Sept. 26.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Seven individuals, including several directors of homeless shelters and non-profits, co-signed the petition to the governor. Forty to 50 individuals will be displaced if the bill is passed, which would create a public safety concern both for the displaced individuals, as well as the larger community, according to the petition. If passed, the bill would take effect Jan. 1, 2018, and the petitioners note that this would leave people homeless in the dead of winter. This would also increase risks of recidivism, petitioners say.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Perceptions of the bill are sharply polarized, and while detractors argue that the legislation jeopardizes public safety, supporters say the bill actually defends it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">State Sen. Frank Lombardi, D-Cranston, is a co-sponsor of the bill and introduced it alongside State Sen. Hanna Gallo, D-Cranston. Cranston is the location of Rhode Island’s largest homeless shelter, Harrington Hall. Harrington has 112 beds which are open to single men. “Harrington Hall has the highest number per capita of registered sex offenders transported there at any given time in the state of Rhode Island,” Lombardi said. This disproportionate concentration of sex offenders in a single neighborhood was the impetus for the bill especially because “the residence hall surrounds at least three elementary schools,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The question of appropriate maintenance of distance between schools and sex offenders is no new issue in Rhode Island. Convicted sex offenders have been restricted from living closer than 300 feet from any school property since 2008, The Providence Journal reported. In June 2015, the General Assembly expanded this to 1,000 feet for Level III sex offenders — those most likely to re-offend. This law placed 64 percent of Providence off-limits to these registered sex offenders, according to the Journal. In October 2015, the lawsuit Freitas et al. v. Kilmartin was filed challenging the law’s constitutionality as violating due process; after the case was filed, a judge placed a restraining order on the law, effective to this day and as long as the case remains unresolved.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s very sad that we have a significant population of people who are required to register as sex offenders that have no place to live but Harrington Hall,” said Andrew Horwitz, petitioner and assistant dean for experiential education at Roger Williams University. Although the 1,000-foot rule is not in effect, the critics of this bill say that sex offenders do not have options other than Harrington Hall because of policies in other shelters and the 300-foot restriction. “We’ve got such incredible restrictions on where registered sex offenders are allowed to live that pretty much any place in Rhode Island that has affordable housing is off-limits for somebody who is a registered sex offender,” Horwitz added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Concerning the safety of the public, “what reduces recidivism is stability,” Horwitz said. “When you render somebody homeless” by limiting the number of beds available to them in shelters, “you destabilize them,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the “public safety” concerns in Lombardi’s district is cases of sex offenders being dropped off at the shelter and loitering if no beds were available. He characterized the bill as an “incentive to have all of these homeless shelters share — not overburden Harrington Hall only with registered sex offenders.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lombardi had not heard about the petition but was not surprised to learn there was one; “there was a very vibrant debate” in the Senate, he recalled, “given the polarizing issues involved; on one side the issue of public safety and on the other side is the issue of homelessness.” Though he supports the bill, Lombardi recognizes more progress is needed to be made toward finding permanent solutions to homelessness, including for sex offenders. “We need the judiciary, we need law enforcement, we need the public housing folks,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The petition proposes an alternative path from the bill: a “study commission” that would devote time and resources to considering viable options for housing for registered sex offenders, which could inform future legislation. It also suggests potential amendments to the bill, such as changing the date it would take effect and limiting its applicability to Level III Sex offenders.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Horwitz himself is in favor of building more homeless shelters and having a more decentralized homeless system to relieve Harrington and the neighborhood; but fundamentally he said he views shelters themselves as only rudimentary solutions to homelessness. He would prefer legislation creating more affordable housing and repealing “irrational” housing restrictions to address Harrington’s predicament.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The main plaintiff in Freitas et al. v. Kilmartin, John Freitas, was a Level III sex offender. Barbara Freitas, director of the Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project and formerly homeless herself, is his widow. She was another of the seven signatories of the petition.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Freitas echoed Horwitz’s concerns. The bill’s “attempt to keep the public safe is failing miserably, because they will end up in the street,” she said. Freitas explained that sex offenders are at least accounted for in a homeless shelter due to the requirement to register. This means that “public safety” is better served by keeping homeless shelters’ numbers of sex offenders uncapped for community members and visitors alike.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Freitas does not expect Raimondo to heed the petition. Freitas says she was part of a previous attempt to convince Raimondo to veto the 300-foot rule, without success. “Nobody wants to have the veto go through about sex offenders. That’s a sure way to have yourself not get elected,” Freitas said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If the governor were to veto the bill, there would be no effort by the legislative branch to override the veto, according to Lombardi. The bill was transmitted to the governor Oct. 3. She is required to sign or veto legislation within six days of transmittal. The bill is “currently under consideration for action in the coming days,” according to the governor’s press office.</span></p>
<em><strong>Correction: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article stated that the bill was passed in the State Senate in May, In fact, it was passed in the State Senate in June. A previous version also contained an incorrect titled for Andrew Horwitz, <span class="s3">petitioner and assistant dean for experiential education at Roger Williams University</span>. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mayor Elorza overviews policy platform at community meeting</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">In this month’s community-wide conversation Wednesday between Mayor Jorge Elorza and Providence residents, the mayor reiterated his administration’s four priorities: budget, infrastructure, education and accessible public officials.</p>
<p class="p4">After taking office three years ago, Elorza started his “City Wide Conversations” series to engage with Providence community members. This month’s conversation took place in Elmhurst at Mount Pleasant High School with the participation of Councilwoman Jo-Ann Ryan.</p>
<p class="p4">The Mayor’s Office re-affirmed its commitment to budget-conscious policy making, Elorza said, noting the city budget’s $10 million surplus. This brings Providence out of its deficit, which the city was in for years before it ran a surplus in 2016, Elorza said. Running a surplus makes Providence a more attractive site for investment going forward, Elorza said.</p>
<p class="p4">The second priority for the city is long-term planning and infrastructure, Elorza said. He said that decades of disinvestment in infrastructure is evident in the streets of the city: “We have many roads that haven’t been paved for 60 years.” Working with the city council, the city will invest $45 million in the coming year to fix roads, bridges and sidewalks.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza also noted that in the past year, City Hall increased investment in education for the first time in nearly seven years, bolstering city summer camps and creating summer learning centers, he said. At one city-sponsored summer camp, participants paid just $5 per child for a week of camp, he said. The program is meant to support parents who can’t afford day-care for their children during the summer.</p>
<p class="p4">Providence also plans to invest up to $400 million in its schools in the span of 10 years. The Mayor’s Office has also launched include an Office of Economic Opportunity, which recruits Providence students who want to take an alternative path from college and connects them with area businesses.</p>
<p class="p4">The city also invested in summer jobs: this year, the amount of available summer work doubled, he said. “I have always believed that number one crime fighting tool we have in the city of Providence is making sure that we have healthy and safe activities for young people throughout the year,” Elorza said.</p>
<p class="p4">Crime dramatically decreased in the city, Elorza added. He said that 2016 marked the first year in city’s history without gang-related homicide.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza also said he aims to make city officials more accessible to the public. Elorza launched a 311 system, which is meant to ease the process of reaching out to the Mayor’s Office specifically. Beyond the Mayor’s Office, Elorza has made sure each city department undergoes training in providing assistance to citizens.</p>
<p class="p4">After the speech, community members asked questions or made comments to the mayor.</p>
<p class="p4">One resident requested more street sweeping in Providence. Elorza said Providence increased street sweeping from twice to four times a year in recent years. Additionally, the city purchased new equipment and gave street sweepers new trainings, Elorza said.</p>
<p class="p4">Another community member asked where Providence planned to get the $45 million it hopes to invest in infrastructure. Elorza said the $45 million will come from municipal bonds, and promised that overall debt will stay stable.</p>
<p class="p4">One resident raised concerns that Providence schools’ lack of staff diversity gives students sub-par educational experiences — when language gaps exist between teachers and students, for example, English language learners lose out, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza responded that his administration has made some efforts to integrate refugee children who do not know English into Providence schools. Elorza created a separate school called Welcoming Center School where refugees are educated until they are ready to transition to a traditional school, Elorza said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Providence kicked off its initiative to renovate public school facilities with the first “All In: Our Learning Spaces” workshop held at Hope High School on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="p4">The workshop asked members of the Providence community to provide feedback on the existing state of public schools in the city and suggest improvements. The city followed up with a similar workshop Thursday.</p>
<p class="p4">“This is an opportunity for us to have a conversation on what we want our schools and education to look like in the future,” said Mayor Jorge Elorza.</p>
<p class="p4">Some Providence schools have leaky roofs, hot classrooms and peeling paint, said Erica Lambert, a parent of a student at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary who attended the workshop. “This sends a message to our kids that they’re not important,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Charisma Sampson, a senior at Hope High School, said she hopes the workshops and the greater ‘All In’ effort will help improve school facilities and give the city’s students a better learning atmosphere. “I don’t want to be nervous walking down the hallway and thinking that the ceiling might fall through,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza first announced the city-wide effort to repair school buildings and facilities in August, and Tuesday’s workshop marked the first phase of a yearlong process, which would plan that effort, to support it.</p>
<p class="p4">The second phase of this process will begin Oct. 17, when a design team will summarize the information gathered in workshop sessions and present their recommendations to Elorza and superintendent of Providence Public Schools Christopher Maher, who will decide next steps, said Lily Gutterman, deputy director of policy for the mayor’s office.</p>
<p class="p4">Phase 3 will roll out in December, at which point the city will present its recommendations to the Providence community for its opinions and approval, Gutterman said.</p>
<p class="p4">To execute its plans, the city will need to borrow. A fiscal analysis showed that Providence has the capacity to borrow up to $400 million over the next decade, said Victor Morente, a spokesperson for Elorza, in an email to The Herald. The city <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170828/providence-mayor-pledges-to-spend-up-to-400m-on-school-repairs">plans</a> to borrow anywhere between $200 and $400 million, the Providence Journal reported.</p>
<p class="p4">While Providence will not begin borrowing money until the renovation plan is fully developed, Morente spoke of multiple borrowing options open to the city once it enters that stage, including a bond referendum. Elorza is also committed to exploring and leveraging public and private partnerships “to maximize every dollar invested in schools,” Morente added in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">While Elorza is leading this city-wide initiative, Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo is also addressing the problem of sub-par school facilities. Every Rhode Island school facility failed state evaluation, according to a report from the state Department of Education. Raimondo signed an executive order in September in response to the report, creating a new commission that would develop solutions and steps to better school facilities across the state.</p>
<p class="p4">While the Governor’s office was not in communication with the Mayor’s office before it launched the executive order, going forward, these two initiatives will require collaboration between the state and city offices, Morente said.</p>
<p class="p4">Providence first uncovered the issue of dilapidated school facilities in April, at the “All In: Providence Education Summit,” which aimed to build and support a cohesive vision for education in Providence, Gutterman said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Wednesday, Mayor Jorge Elorza announced that Providence is expecting a $10 million surplus for fiscal year 2017. In a press release, the mayor said that 2017 was the second year in a row that Providence has had a fiscal surplus, this year’s estimated at $10,206,604.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Elorza administration is expected to eliminate cumulative deficit, the first rainy day <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171004/providence-to-show-102m-surplus-for-fiscal-year-says-mayor">fund</a> since 2011. After FY 2015, the city had a total deficit of $13,445,000, which had accumulated in years past. At the end of FY 2016, the city’s deficit decreased approximately $10,000,000, leaving the current deficit at $3,158,000.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This 2017 fiscal surplus will eradicate all of the city’s deficit. The rest of the fund will be left to a “Rainy Day Fund,” which can be drawn from if needed in future years. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The city realized savings due to earlier pension payments and reduced spending on operational expenses where opportunities existed,” wrote Press Secretary Victor Morente in an email to The Herald. The surplus can be “attributed to realistic budgeting, continued strategic cash management, more efficient and robust tax collections, better departmental revenues and attrition savings in salary expenditures,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Morente said that “the FY 2017 budget actually decreased the residential and commercial property tax rates, although a state-led revaluation of property values showed a rise in property values in the capital city.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Councilman David Salvatore said that a deficit “completely hinders the city’s ability to do business,” and this year’s positive fund balance sends a positive message both to businesses, who are looking to expand in the city, and to tax payers, who saw that the city had not solely relied on their taxes to eliminate the deficit. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Salvatore said that over the course of the last several years, the city departments were asked to “do more with less.” He says this responsible budget spending contributed to the surplus alongside the city’s increase in revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The money from the Rainy Day Fund will be reinvested into the city’s public safety, infrastructure and education that is conducive to 21st-century learning, said Salvatore. In a follow up email, he added that affordable housing should be “an area the city should also invest taxpayer money in.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Motorcyclists camp out on Thayer St.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On a Tuesday night in October, Thayer Street is quiet, interrupted only by a sound that has become a staple around campus: motorcycles.</p>
<p class="p2">The bikers, who hail from across Providence and nearby towns, park $20,000 motorcycles on the curb in front of an abandoned Thayer storefront. The older Harley riders look at some of the ramshackle bikes that roll through.</p>
<p class="p2">The Thayer Street bikers are one of the many groups of locals that students often come across at Brown but don’t bother talking to.</p>
<p class="p2">Though many students consider Thayer an extension of campus, the bikers treat Thayer as their own.</p>
<p class="p2">“Mostly, it’s a place to hang out, look at bikes, talk about bikes and get a bite to eat,” said Sonny, a lifelong Providence resident who grew up coming to Thayer Street to skateboard. The bikers declined to give their last names — some cited previous arrest records.</p>
<p class="p2">On warm fall evenings, up to a dozen motorcyclists can be found with their bikes at the corner of Thayer Street and Euclid Street.</p>
<p class="p2">Students often refer to these bikers as the “Thayer Street motorcycle gang,” but the bikers say there is no set crew. It is a rotating slew of bikers, some who know each other well and others who are just meeting for the first time.</p>
<p class="p2">It’s a mix of older riders with laid-back Harleys, optimal for cruising, and younger riders with loud sports bikes, fast for racing, Sonny said. One of the oldest of his comrades at 42, Sonny still hasn’t traded in his racing bike for a Harley.</p>
<p class="p2">The bikers are mostly men, with a few exceptions.</p>
<p class="p2">Tammy and Maggie are two female bikers from Fall River, Mass. They come to Thayer because it’s warmer than their home just 15 miles away.</p>
<p class="p2">Tammy said she was in a motorcycle accident 15 years ago and has only recently gotten back into biking.</p>
<p class="p2">When she re-entered the world of motorcycles, she brought her neighbor Maggie along with her. The two venture to Thayer Street together to hang out with other riders and people-watch.</p>
<p class="p2">“You see some crazy sights around here,” Tammy said.</p>
<p class="p2">And the culinary attractions are undeniable.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’ll put it this way: My father owns a pizza place, and I still come here,” said Omar, a motorcycle rider in his twenties, as he stood next to his bike outside of Antonio’s.</p>
<p class="p2">Other popular late night favorites include Baja’s, Mike’s Calzones and East Side Pockets, said Chris, Omar’s friend and fellow motorcycle rider. They come to Thayer “whenever hunger strikes,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bobby and Steve, both motorcycle riders from Warwick, reminisced over Nice Slice as the former pizza alternative to Antonio’s. But they are thankful for the late hours kept by Thayer eateries, which are a step up from the late-night fast food options in their neighborhood. “At least here you can get a decent bite after hours,” Steve said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Providence police to wear body cameras</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/18/providence-police-wear-body-cameras/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Body-Worn Camera Program, which will require all on-duty Providence patrol officers to wear body cameras, went into effect Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An earlier form of the General Order was first introduced by the Providence Police Department Administrative Bureau in 2015, and an eight-week pilot program followed in the summer of 2016, according to Lt. Joe Donnelly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Different officers took (the body cameras) just to see how they would like them,” Donnelly said. “Most (of) the officers felt comfortable.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cameras from two different BWC companies, Axon and Vie-Vu, were tried out during the pilot period, and the Axon’s Body 2 Camera was ultimately selected. The Providence City Finance Committee and the full council approved the proposition, which also received commentary from other groups and individuals. This allowed for the cameras — along with 250 Tasers — to be purchased through a federal grant. Once the grant expires, the city’s Department of Public Safety will pay any associated costs itself. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The body cameras are going to be an excellent tool for the Providence Police Department,” said Councilman of Ward 6 and Deputy Majority Leader Michael Correia. “If an officer is being accused of using excessive force or deadly force or is verbally abusive to somebody, well, now we have it on tape,” he said, adding that camera can protect police officers as well if they face a false allegation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Each acting patrol officer will wear the square-shaped camera on the center of his chest, in plain view of the public, and turn it on during “all enforcement encounters where there is at least reasonable suspicion that a person has committed, is committing, or may be involved in criminal activity,” according to the General Order. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The cameras feature a manual on and off switch, and the policy cites 10 specific instances when the camera should be turned off. These include instances where the officer is dealing with victims of sex crimes or child abuse or when entering places where a reasonable expectation of privacy exists.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The cameras are assigned to our officers just as their other equipment is,” said Public Information Officer for the Department Public Safety Lindsay Lague. “They will be required to take the camera home, as they do their radio, and place it in the docking station and video will automatically be uploaded.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The footage is uploaded to a cloud-storage system, Evidence.com. Public record requests by members of the public wishing to view the footage are reviewed within the parameters of the Rhode Island Access to Public Records Act. But some groups, such as the Rhode Island American Civil Liberties Union, are concerned with this procedure. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The problem with the APRA is that it … lists 10 or 15 things that are exceptions for anything that the state police has,” said Policy Associate of the R.I. ACLU Marcela Betancur. “That makes it a little harder for the public … to have access to some of this information.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The R.I. ACLU is expected to send its formal edits to the Providence Police Department by the end of the week but maintains that the body cameras are<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“definitely a step forward,” Betancur said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But some groups questioned the effectiveness of body cameras in curbing issues institutionalized in policing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We saw Rodney King get beaten up in ’92 on camera and the perpetrator still got away. … We’ve seen black people being shot and murdered on camera and nothing’s really been done, even though you can definitely see the killers,” said Vanessa Flores-Maldonado, organizer of the Providence Community Safety Act. “We’re not really counting on this to be something that helps solve police brutality and harassment. … We don’t believe body cameras will do much to curve racial profiling. And if it does, great, perfect, we’d love to be proven wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Officers will be trained to operate the cameras and understand its policy in a 3-day training session, according to Donnelly. The department is expected to be fully equipped within eight to 12 weeks.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>City takes action to enforce removing of notices on poles</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">At Thursday’s Providence City Council meeting, the city passed several resolutions on gun measures, removing all notices posted on poles and training recreation department employees on sexual assault and child abuse.</p>
<p class="p4">The council passed Councilman John Igliozzi’s resolution to have the city’s Police Department issue fines for posting notices on telephone poles in Providence and the Department of Public Works remove any notices. Councilman David Salvatore told The Herald excess signage is already a violation according to a city ordinance, but the city’s new resolution allows them to enforce the ordinance.</p>
<p class="p4">Igliozzi said that this resolution is protecting the quality of life and will encourage community members to respect their neighborhood. “We need to instill the sense of ownership,” Igliozzi said. He also drew attention to the fact that people outside Providence are responsible for the proliferation of signs and advertisements, and they get away with what they are doing.</p>
<p class="p4">Echoing Igliozzi’s opinion on the importance of enforcing the excess signage ordinance, Councilman Nicholas Narducci said it is very easy to find the people who post signs since they have phone numbers and addresses on their notices, but the city did not want to take responsibility to enforce it.</p>
<p class="p4">The council also passed four resolutions introduced by Salvatore supporting congressional gun measures. These resolutions include the “Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act” and the re-establishment of the Federal Assault Weapon Ban. Salvatore said that these are common sense gun measures that were introduced in Congress in light of recent mass shootings in the country. “It is important for the city council to take a stand,” Salvatore told The Herald. “We have a moral obligation to take a position.”</p>
<p class="p4">The council also passed a resolution that will require employees from the Recreation Department to go through sexual assault and child abuse training from the Department of Children, Youth and Families, which was introduced by councilman Luis Aponte.</p>
<p class="p4">The city passed resolution recognizing the month of October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month, also introduced by Salvatore. The resolution was co-sponsored by the whole council.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Greater Good Gathering holds inaugural conference</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/22/greater-good-gathering-holds-inaugural-conference/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">The first Greater Good Gathering conference took place this weekend at the Providence Biltmore, featuring speakers from a host of different disciplines<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>including Martin Luther King III. Under the slogan of “Charting a Path in Changing Times — Democracy, Citizenship &amp; the Greater Good,” the conference featured panels, discussions and speeches on topics ranging from public sector innovation to the power of technology over the course of three days.</p>
<p class="p4">The organizer of the event, Eric Schnurer ’80 is both a Brown alum and a former adjunct professor at the University’s Taubman Center for Public Policy. He said that the gathering is part of a larger idea that he has been working on in conjunction with the University to increase discussion around initiatives and work that contributes to “the greater good.” He said he wanted to connect students, faculty and practitioners from different disciplines to work together to make the world a better place.</p>
<p class="p4">The original idea started with a few people brainstorming in Schnurer’s house about how to develop new for-profit social venture models for making constructive contributions, Shnurer said. He initially wanted to develop a “for-profit social venture” model to implement himself but realized the need for more conversations like the ones he was having. So, he established an annual meeting instead.</p>
<p class="p4">Martin Luther King III, the son of Martin Luther King Jr., initiated Saturday’s events with an address about “Doing Good in the 21st Century.” Remembering his father as both a man of action and a preacher, King reiterated his father’s ideas about how changing thoughts can lead to changing actions. He also emphasized the role of non-violent resistance in contributing to the public good.</p>
<p class="p4">In a panel called “Defending Democracy and the Future of the Public Good,” panelists talked about what democracy means and how to use it to serve the public good. They also had a heated discussion on whether and how technology can be “democratizing” force.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Centering some of their discussion on the Women’s March, the panelists talked about the impact of social media on institutions and social movements.</p>
<p class="p4">After the panel, Kalev Leetaru, senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University, gave a talk on the different ways data is used to study human society and explained the concept of “big data.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He said that technology is a tool, not a savior, and talked about the misunderstanding that giving information solves everything. “Society always adapts,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">He said that online polls about the 2016 elections failed because Democrats are generally more likely to use social media and this misled many of them to believe that nominee Hillary Clinton would easily win.</p>
<p class="p4">He also talked about the influential role of advertisements and companies on censoring and controlling the data on social media and the internet in general. Sometimes advertisers have more sway in the content on social media — regulating whether certain news stories can show up next to their ads, for example — than governments who want to censor social media platforms do, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Several Brown students also attended the event to talk about the ways their innovations and entrepreneurship contributed to social good. These students include Cliff Weitzman ’16 , founder of Speechify. Weitzman, who was named to the Forbes 30 under 30 list at the age of 23, talked about his experience going through school with dyslexia. He said this led him to invent Speechify, an app which turns text into audiobooks using deep learning.</p>
<p class="p4">Another social entrepreneur, Maya Faulstich-Hon ’17.5, founder of Kulisha, spoke about changing norms around how society discusses “waste.” Her venture converts organic waste into a sustainable insect protein for use in animal feeds, thereby reducing organic waste, she explained to the audience.</p>
<p class="p4">Despite featuring many Brown students as speakers, the event had low student attendance. Schnurer said he hopes to attract more students as the event becomes more established and people hear about it from word of mouth. He encouraged students to attend the future conferences, which will be held annually from now on, saying that a well-rounded education should ask students to think and learn about how to contribute positively to the lives of others.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Pinnacle Logistics, a Dallas-based cargo management company, will begin operating out of T.F. Green Airport this month. The move — a result of an agreement reached between Pinnacle, the Rhode Island Airport Corporation and the Quonset Development Corporation — will bring as many as 300 jobs to the Ocean State.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to working out of T.F. Green, Pinnacle entered a contract to operate out of Quonset Business Park. The proximity of these locations will facilitate cargo operations for the company, said Rhode Island’s Secretary of Commerce Stefan Pryor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Quonset approached Pinnacle when it “became aware of Pinnacle’s interest in a facility in Rhode Island though our real estate broker,” said David Preston, a spokesperson for Quonset.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Their most urgent need was to hire lots of employees quickly,” said Michael Healey, Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training chief of public affairs. The state is taking an active hand in acquainting Pinnacle with job-seeking Rhode Islanders through the Business Workforce Center, a part of the Department of Labor and Training. “We’re trying to connect Pinnacle to people that they want to hire,” Healey said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">New hires will work at either the T.F. Green Airport or Quonset Business Park. According to EmployRI, the R.I. Department of Labor and Training’s job-matching service, positions with Pinnacle include ramp agents, who service cargo planes at the airport, warehouse agents and other driver or manager positions. By the beginning of October, Pinnacle had already “hired 170 ramp agents and 10 to 15 drivers,” Healey said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is no coincidence that Pinnacle has decided to set up operations in Rhode Island, Pryor said. Rhode Island has implemented initiatives to help “create an environment that’s conducive to business,” such as lowering the corporate minimum tax and corporate income tax and eliminating the tax on energy for business, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, the state’s corporate income tax rate is 7 percent and the corporate minimum tax is $450.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pryor hopes that the agreement will generate “economic energy” for Rhode Island. Although the unemployment rate dipped down in September to 4.2 percent, according to the Providence Business News, some Rhode Islanders still struggle to find employment in the state. “We’re always trying to help jobless Rhode Islanders,” Healey added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Only two candidates, community activist Kobi Dennis and Mayor Jorge Elorza, have confirmed their candidacies for the 2018 Providence mayoral race.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meg Clurman, finance director for Elorza’s first campaign, confirmed to The Herald Oct. 18 that Elorza plans to run for reelection, but said the campaign has no further comments at this time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elorza has not assembled a campaign team yet. But as the incumbent mayor, Elorza has an advantage in the mayoral race. The last time an incumbent mayor lost to a challenger was 1974 when Vincent “Buddy” Cianci Jr., a Republican, beat Democrat Joseph Doorley Jr.. Dennis, Elorza’s opponent, is a Providence native and community activist who lives with his family in the city. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He wants to disprove that candidates need to be a part of “political machines.” “I think running for mayor involves family values, a rich personality and honesty,” Dennis said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elorza certainly outpaces Dennis on campaign fundraising. At the time of his interview with The Herald, Dennis reported that his campaign filed their first financial disclosure report with no funds. Elorza, on the other hand, has a head-start on fundraising with $484,502 collected thus far, according to campaign finance documents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dennis compared beginning his mayoral race to starting his own community organizations, such as Princes 2 Kings, Project Night Vision XL and Unified Solutions RI, which connect disadvantaged youth with after-school programming and unemployed adults with job opportunities, among other missions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Aspects of Dennis’s voter outreach method had been untraditional so far. As part of his strategy, Dennis goes to nightclubs and social events to connect with young voters as his target demographic is people ages 16-24, he said. Dennis said he hopes to reach young voters to educate them on the voting and campaign donation processes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dennis, who volunteered in Elorza’s first 2012 campaign, said he would differ from Elorza as mayor both in term of policy and outreach to the community. Dennis pointed to Elorza’s regulations on homelessness, crime and the bridge between law enforcement and the community as policies that he would like to change. Dennis also stressed the importance of community involvement and engagement through community forums and one-on-one conversations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I just want a better outcome. If that means me losing, I’m okay with that. In no way will I take a deal with anyone. I am going to run until the end,” Dennis said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Lorne Adrain, a businessman and community activist in Providence, has not officially declared his intentions to run for mayor, though local news outlets have <a href="http://wpri.com/2017/10/02/kobi-dennis-is-in-heres-who-else-might-run-for-providence-mayor/">speculated</a> that he will.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I am thinking seriously about it. I am thinking about the job, the city and what needs to be done,” Adrain said, adding that he is still unsure whether he would ultimately decide to run.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Adrain has thought about what his campaign would look like if he does run for mayor. His platform would focus mainly on entrepreneurship and financial restructuring for Providence, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think those are the two key things we have to do dramatically better. That would lead to more resources with the schools, neighborhoods and programs for kids. Without fundamental transformation of our economic base, none of that stuff would happen,” Adrain said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Adrain supports the Elorza administration, he pointed to specific improvements that could be made. “From personal experience and from what I’m hearing from many people, (Elorza has) lost the confidence of too many people and too many groups in the city to be successful,” Adrain said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other news outlets have predicted State Rep. Raymond Hull, D-Providence and North Providence, State Rep. John Lombardi, D-Pawtucket, and Councilman David Salvatore will join the race. Hull declined to comment on the speculation while Lombardi and Salvatore did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Council to consider renaming Magee Street to Bannister Street</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Updated Nov. 1 at 4:35 p.m.</strong>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3">The Providence City Council will consider renaming Magee Street — named after slave-trader William F. Megee — to Bannister Street, commemorating the 19th-century local black activists Edward and Christiana Bannister. The council's Urban Redevelopment Committee passed a resolution to rename the street Monday. The resolution will be voted on by the city council during its Nov. 16 meeting, wrote Providence City Council Press Secretary Bill Kepner in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3">Edward Bannister, a famed landscape and portrait painter, was awarded the “Best Artist in America” at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. His wife, Christiana Bannister, a successful businesswoman, served as one of Providence’s first civic leaders, founding the Home for Aged Colored Women, which evolved into the Bannister Center nursing home.</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3">“These people lived in a time when African-Americans did not have any freedom,” testified Cheryl Jordan at the committee session. She is president of Stages of Freedom, an organization that empowers minority youth in Rhode Island. “And yet with the freedom that they did have, they didn’t just do something for African-Americans. They served the greater community.”</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3">The Bannisters would have regularly walked the street, having lived on Benevolent before Wriston Quad was built.</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3">With this change, the city will also eradicate the commemoration of a slave trader. Many cities have taken similar measures to remove commemorations to controversial historical figures since protests erupted in August over the removal of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville, Virgina.</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3">“The timing of this request was very fortunate,” said Councilman Samuel Zurier of Ward 2, who introduced a bill championing the change <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_422580889"><span class="aQJ">Sept. 26</span></span>. Earlier that month, the City Council approved legislation condemning Confederate symbols on public property, The Herald previously reported. Because the state was part of the Union during the Civil War, the legislation was a gesture of solidarity and not meant to rectify a local issue, he added. “On the other hand, we do have this legacy in R.I. about being involved in the slave trade. So it just looked like the perfect opportunity to address this national issue in the context of where we live.”</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3">Stages of Freedom proposed to rename a street for the Bannisters more than a year ago. The organization exhausted several options before settling on Magee Street. Residents were sometimes concerned they would have to change their address.</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3">Upon receiving positive feedback from the community on changing “Magee Street,” Ray Rickman, Stages of Freedom’s executive director, proposed the idea to Zurier.</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3">Jordan and Rickman of Stages of Freedom testified in favor of the resolution alongside Providence City Archivist, Caleb Horton; Manager of Policy and Research of the Council, Nick Freeman and Executive Director of the Rhode Island Historical Society, C. Morgan Grefe. Letters of support from Chief of Police, Colonel Hugh Clements Jr., Commissioner of Public Safety, Steven Paré, and Postmaster Ronald Pauline were also shared.</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3"> “My only regret is that the street is so short that we can’t make an even bigger statement about two of the most amazing people I’ve had the privilege to study and treasure,” Grefe said in session.</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3"> The resolution — despite overwhelming support from the community — did initially receive criticism from Richard Wagner and Elizabeth Wheeler, who run a psychiatry practice on the corner of Benevolent and Magee Streets.</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3"> The objecting party made claims that changing its business address would cost thousands of dollars, but Rickman rejected the legitimacy of those figures and argued that their business did not directly face Magee Street but rather Benevolent Street — as the actual address is <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=12+Benevolent+Street&amp;entry=gmail&amp;source=g">12 Benevolent Street</a>.   Wagner and Wheeler did not attend the committee session.</p>
<p class="m_-6650720560061880519gmail-m_-4790614136694775576gmail-p3">The passed resolution will be finalized by the Urban Redevelopment Committee <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_422580890"><span class="aQJ">next Thursday</span></span>. It marks a significant victory for the community, according to Stages of Freedom.</p>
<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article said that the Providence City Council voted on the resolution Monday. In fact, the Urban Redevelopment Committee voted on the resolution — the council has yet to vote on it. A previous headline for this story also reflected the error and has since been changed. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On Wednesday, Mayor Jorge Elorza hosted an Interfaith Forum at the Providence Career and Technical Academy to discuss prejudice, community safety and policy changes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Right now, the forces that are dividing us and separating us are stronger than they have been in any of our lifetimes. It’s important to constantly come together,” Elorza said to open the night. “The forces of unity take effort and energy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The event, which was free and open the public, featured speakers such as Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris, members of the mayor’s Muslim American Advisory Board, interfaith representatives, public safety officials and representatives from various community organizations.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elorza spoke in support of the various marginalized communities in Providence, including immigrants and the LGBTQ community. He mentioned the city’s efforts to protect minority citizens by making Providence a sanctuary city, providing municipal forms of identification and creating a new hate-crime hotline.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our city is already great, not in spite of our diversity and differences, but because of them,” Elorza said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The forum was organized by Jordan van Leesten, who works in community relations for the mayor’s office. “Providence is a very diverse city,” Leesten said. “I wanted to find a way to celebrate that and showcase it in a way that’s intellectual.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Leesten pushed for the event after seeing how various Rhode Island religious groups came together in support of a local mosque that was sent hate mail. The event also came out of meetings with the mayor’s Muslim American Advisory Board, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">During the discussion portion of the night, community members and religious leaders discussed their faith and filled out worksheets that asked participants to think about the various communities in Providence and the challenges they face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Let’s make sure we send the message that Providence is a welcoming place for all of its residents,” Elorza said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris of Ward 11 stressed the importance of building bridges within the community. “We all need to be able to elevate our faith more than ever. As we watch the news and hear of the violence that’s happening daily, I look to my own faith to guide me through these troubling times,” Harris said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Former president of the Rhode Island Council for Muslim Advancement Imam Farid Ansari contextualized yesterday’s terrorist attack in New York in the larger trend of anti-Muslim rhetoric. “They never emphasize when Muslims do good things — what’s up with that? I am a Muslim and I am an American and I will defend that,” Ansari said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We at the Rhode Island Council of Churches intend to make sure we are using our voices properly and assertively and that we together will stand together against injustices,” said the Rev. Chontell Washington, president of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Gathering with faith communities like today — that gives me strength to step forward in these dark days,” said Rabbi Sarah Mack, president of the Board of Rabbis of Greater Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Missy Ottun, a student of Blackstone Academy, spoke on her experiences as a black Muslim in Rhode Island, emphasizing the continued importance of “challenging what’s in the media and asking questions.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lieutenant Henry Remolina, commanding officer of Districts 2 and 3, spoke on his efforts to prevent crimes that target immigrants. “Let’s first start building a relationship together,” Remolina said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And this won’t be the last event of its kind, Leesten said. “I want to continue to celebrate the religious diversity in this city and showcase it in a productive way.”</span></p>
<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article said that <span class="s3">Imam Farid Ansari is the</span><span class="s3"> president of the Rhode Island Council for Muslim Advancement. In fact, he is the former president. The Herald regrets the error.</span></strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A new initiative, called PVD Healthworks, will supply and strengthen the health care and social assistance workforce in Providence and Cranston. The initiative was introduced Oct. 20 at a press conference by Mayor Jorge Elorza alongside Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training Director Scott Jensen, Providence Economic Opportunity Director Brian Hull, representatives from Workforce Solutions of Providence and Cranston and various health care providers. PVD Healthworks will be funded by a $300,000 grant from RIDLT and will join the department’s Real Jobs Rhode Island program.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">PVD Healthworks is led by Jensen and Mielette McFarlane, grant adviser of Real Jobs RI. The initiative will connect employers in the health care industry with educational programs such as Rhode Island College, working together to create curriculums and conduct training based on the needs of the employers. The city of Providence will act as an intermediary, and this triad of partnership will supply the health care labor demand for the greater Rhode Island community. PVD Healthworks will work with the Genesis Center to train people to be direct support professionals, who work with people with physical disabilities, assisting them as they become integrated into the community and working environment. This training will be done through the Genesis Center. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Island’s most recent labor force statistics show that the health care and social assistance sector made up 80,900 of the 495,100 total jobs in the state, which means that over 16 percent of all Rhode Island jobs are related to health care and social assistance, the biggest sector in the labor force, according to an RIDLT press release. Though health care made up such a large portion of workers in the state, there is a significant labor shortage in the health care and social assistance industry, Jensen said. The health care sector is the state’s biggest employer, Jensen added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to this labor shortage, there has been an observed mismatch between the skills the workforce is equipped with and the skills the health care sector requires as it evolves to accommodate changing demographics and service delivery, according to Elorza’s press release.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The PVD Healthworks partnership addresses this need for labor in the health care sector, MacFarlane said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This initiative will strengthen our workforce by providing pathways to good jobs for residents. This partnership will help us continue to provide economic opportunities for residents throughout our city,” Elorza said at the press conference.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a demand-driven workforce development program, Real Jobs RI brings together employers and other key stakeholders in an attempt to address workforce demands in various industries, simultaneously providing workers in the state with the adequate skills to address these demands, according to Michael Healey, chief public affairs officer and RIDLT.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In 33 sector partnerships, 16 industries and more than 15 distinct skills-training programs across the state, (Real Jobs RI is) knitting together the demand side of the labor market … and investing in the competitiveness of both,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Healey said .</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since Gov. Gina Raimondo created Real Jobs RI in 2015, over 200 companies have hired more than 900 workers trained by the program, and another 600 incumbent workers have been trained for future advancement, Healey said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Before Real Jobs RI, the state’s workforce development efforts were spread thin across many programs, funding streams and agencies,” Healey said. “This led to mismatches: People who completed the training programs didn’t have the skills employers really wanted. Consequently, … government had a credibility problem with Rhode Island employers.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By giving companies the chance to collaborate with partners such as colleges, technical education programs and community-based organizations, Real Jobs RI directly matches people equipped with necessary skills with employers in need of these skills, according to a press release from Elorza’s office.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The real framework for a successful Real Jobs RI partnership is that it is demand-driven, meaning that they (Real Jobs RI) are getting information (on) what the jobs are that are necessary to focus on, and they go and survey, having conversations with companies themselves,” McFarlane said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Community-Police act criticized as implementation nears</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the Providence Community-Police Relations Act — formerly named the Community Safety Act — passed June 1 with a 13-1 vote in the Providence City Council, supporters celebrated — one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation regulating police-community relations in the country had been signed into law. Five months later, as the act approaches its implementation Jan. 1, questions remain regarding how that process will go. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The idea to implement a set of laws regulating police-community conduct first began in 2014, but the path from inception to passage was riddled with controversy. The ordinance went through a series of revisions and drafts before passage this June. The final version included a provision banning racial, gender-based, religious or sexual-orientation based profiling; a section that provided residents with a way to challenge being named on the city’s “gang database;” and a standard of conduct for police officers conducting traffic or pedestrian stops, Rhode Island Public Radio reported. The ordinance passed with a sweeping majority. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While a host of people showed support during the legislative process by participating in marches and rallies, many are “not sticking around” for the implementation phase, said Vanessa Flores-Maldonado, the main organizer behind the Community Police Relations Act. She raised concerns over the negative attitude of the Fraternal Order of Police, the city’s police union, toward the act and questioned the effectiveness of Providence External Review Authority. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PERA is a regulatory body, established with a broad mission to “investigate allegations of misconduct” within the city’s police department, according to the city’s main website. As of Jan. 1, this will include violations related to the CPRA. PERA changes staffing every few years and it will be staffed with the new members in 2018, according to Mary Kay Harris, Providence City Councilwoman. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The City Council will choose 8 community members, from 8 different city wards, to serve on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(PERA). The Mayor will choose one,” wrote Harris in an email to The Herald. Harris was on the inaugural PERA committee when it was first established in 2002. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Flores-Maldonado said the resistance from the Fraternal Order of Police makes the act difficult to implement. In an interview with WPRI published two weeks ago, the police union’s new president Michael Imondi said he doesn’t think an ordinance that makes major changes to how officers do their jobs is necessary. He has been against PCPRA “since day one,” and the majority of his members share his sentiments, but the Fraternal Order of Police is not sure whether they can repeal CPRA before Jan. 1, he told WPRI. “In a perfect world, I’d like to see it repealed or taken back,” he said to WPRI.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Fraternal Order of Police did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Steven Brown, the director of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union shares Maldonado’s concern over the Fraternal Order of Police’s attitude but thinks it is unlikely the city council will make any major changes at the last minute. “Too many people would be extremely upset to see that happen, I don’t think they want to go in that road,” he added. Having a police chief who is vigilant and ready to take action against the officers who violate the ordinance will be crucial in the implementation process, Brown said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lindsay Lague, a spokesperson for the Providence Police Department, said the police department is currently working diligently to ensure its policies are updated in accordance to CPRA by Jan. 1 and that training and resources are in place to ensure successful compliance. “The department worked with the community as part of a working group that helped create and review the ordinance and we are confident our department will adapt swiftly to any changes to current policies,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PERA will be tasked with reviewing certain police policies to make sure they align with CPRA once it goes into effect. The regulatory body is another source of concern for Maldonado. PERA has a lot of power in the implementation process, and it will be important to ensure the board is properly staffed by unbiased members, she said. Since community members do not have a say on who gets elected to PERA, Maldonado worried the board might overrepresent police interests and underrepresent community ones.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But Harris says there is representation on the board because it is comprised of community members from across the city. She added that “the board can and will be neutral. Members will have to have certain skills, they will have to be committed and there will be required training to ensure the neutrality of the group.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Concern about PERA’s role in CPRA implementation stems partly from its history in the city according to Brown. “PERA mainly has been toothless in the past in terms of being really able to take any action against officers who may have violated earlier ordinances or engaged in other types of police misconduct,” Brown said. Other means of enforcing the ordinance could carry a lot of importance in successful implementation, he said. These means include supervisory police officers willing to take action within the department or community members who decide to bring lawsuits under the ordinance. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the past, “PERA was underfunded and unable to really do the work that is was intended to do,” Harris wrote. But going forward, the “City Council did not invest in this program to fail. We are committed to making this work and work well for all community members.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Outside of potential implementation challenges, Brown also expressed concern over the removal of a provision in an earlier version of the act that would have allowed successful plaintiffs to recover their attorney’s fees. As a matter of civil liberty, anyone who feels their rights have been violated has the prerogative to bring their complaints to court and seek legal remedy, but the cost of representation may deter people whose rights were wrongfully violated from taking legal action, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But overall, the ordinance is successful in covering many different grounds — from defining the standard of conduct for police in pedestrian and traffic stops, to enumerating the rights of immigrants in the city, Brown said. “The ordinance is really pretty clear on what is allowed and what is not allowed. It is not a question of how do we enforce this provision, it is whether it actually gets enforced or not,” Brown said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Thursday’s Providence City Council meeting, which lasted for less than 15 minutes, the city passed resolutions to increase efforts to educate the city on recycling and to assign a crossing guard at Bradley School Providence on Broadway.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Councilman David Salvatore’s resolution, which was co-sponsored by the entire council states that Providence’s recycling rate between the months of November 2016 and January 2017 was just under 9 percent. This is despite the fact Rhode Island aims to recycle at least 35 percent of the solid waste generated by the state, The resolution also states that since new residents who speak different languages come to Providence annually, there should be consistent recycling education efforts that are accessible to all city residents at various points throughout the year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A resolution to authorize the city to obtain not more than $2,010,000 from the Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corporation and to finance improvements to school facilities in the city was referred to the Committee on Finance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> An ordinance amending Chapter 14, “Licenses,” of Providence’s Code of Ordinances by adding “predictable and progressive discipline for repeated violations” and a petition from attorney John Garrahy requesting to change the zoning district for the property located at 37 South Angell St. was referred to the Committee on Ordinances.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An ordinance establishing a tax exemption and a stabilization plan for the Aspen Group was passed for the first time while the ordinance for approving and adopting the Special Redevelopment Plan for Vacant Houses passed for the second time.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">At a hearing Nov. 2, the city’s Board of Licenses unanimously revoked all licenses of the Penthouse nightclub, owned by 334 South Water LLC, for incidents that occurred between Sept. 30 and Oct. 22. The delayed revocation of the nightclub’s licenses, along with other failures of the Board of Licenses, led to Mayor Jorge Elorza’s calling for the resignation of the board’s chair Juan Pichardo, who resigned Nov. 2. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Vice Chair Charles Newton said at the hearing that Penthouse had multiple counts of four violations: a breach of conditions on their liquor license, disorder, late hours of operation and nudity on premises where alcohol is being served. The board also took note of the nightclub’s history in making its decision, Newton added. The state’s Department of Business Regulation issued a sanction against the club Aug. 1, 2016. It also received a warning regarding a nudity ordinance. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The continuing nature of the same violations after contact with the police (is) indicative of a lack of responsibility and lack of concern for the welfare of the public,” Newton said, adding that this decision would also preclude 334 South Water LLC from applying for licenses in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Commissioner Dylan Conley added that the board should take into account the administrative record of both the owner of the nightclub and its managerial staff for past incidents.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An emergency board meeting Oct. 28 ordered the club to close for 72 hours due to shots fired after 2 a.m. the night before, as reported by the Providence Journal. Sgt. David Tejada said at the emergency meeting that police found five bullet<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>shell casings near the club. According to the meeting’s minutes, the board ordered Penthouse to temporarily close Oct. 31 until the board’s final meeting Nov. 2. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In an Oct. 28 statement, Elorza said he would recommend the board revoke all of Penthouse’s licenses for good. Elorza was disappointed by the Department of Business Regulation’s overturning of the Board of Licenses decision to revoke the nightclub’s liquor license<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— which was named “The Loft” at the time — in April.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Local neighborhood associations also encouraged the revocation of the nightclub’s licenses. In a statement addressed to the board Oct. 25, the College Hill Neighborhood Association wrote: “We strongly oppose this entertainment license and request that the license be revoked and that future requests for renewal be denied.” The CHNA wrote the club was located within 200 feet of many residences, in which “Providence zoning laws prohibit both nightclub and adult use.” The CHNA also wrote that it had received complaints from residents as a result of excessive noise and public nuisance. In an email sent to The Herald after the gunshots Oct. 28, CHNA President Josh Eisen wrote, “we were already concerned, and shots fired definitely increases those concerns.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sharon Steele, vice president of the Jewelry District Association and neighborhood realtor, said the surrounding neighborhood had dealt with Penthouse’s issues since February. “There has been a continual and habitual pattern of violence literally for all of 2017,” she said. Steele added that the police force has been very cooperative with residents throughout, but the board was not cooperative.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> There are now only three nightclubs in the Jewelry District, Steele said, compared to 10 in 1997. “We systematically closed the other seven because they were a scourge on the neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “It’s a discrimination issue,” the owner of Penthouse, Stamatould Mitrelis,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>said to NBC 10 News in response to her treatment in theEast Side. “They do not want certain people of color in the neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There is not one ounce of truth to that statement,” Steele said, responding to Mitrelis’ statement. “The East Side is one of the most diverse communities … because of Brown University, Rhode Island School of Design (and) all of the hospitals.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a news release from Oct. 30, Councilman Seth Yurdin, whose ward includes the club, said the Oct. 28 gunfire incident “occurred just a day after (the) City’s Board of Licenses failed to move forward with a hearing to revoke the club’s license” and a month after the board issued the club licenses despite objection from the Providence Police Department. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Councilman Yurdin wrote in an Oct. 19 letter addressed to Elorza that the board has been performing poorly despite efforts by the Elorza administration due to “larger underlying issues of poor recordkeeping, out-of-date policies and procedures and insufficiently trained board members.” Due to these failures, “it is extremely difficult for the board to uphold its duty to enforce our licensing laws and promote safe and responsible nightlife in Providence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a statement released on Oct. 30, Elorza called for the resignation of Juan Pichardo as chair of the Board of Licenses. “Providence deserves leadership on our licensing board that reflects the shared values of the communities that they represent,” Elorza said. Pichardo resigned Nov. 2.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We were working in a way that was very progressive along with everyone here,” said Pichardo at the Nov. 2 meeting. “I was disappointed … to come here and be removed as chair.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Representatives from the Board of Licenses and Penthouse nightclub did not respond to multiple requests for comment by The Herald.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rhode Island applies to host Amazon’s second headquarters</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In under seven weeks, the state of Rhode Island managed to put together a competitive proposal for Amazon’s second North American headquarters, following the tech giant’s call for applications Sept. 7. The proposal — submitted Oct. 19 and one of 238 total that Amazon received — outlined potential plans for a headquarters located in one of seven possible cities across Rhode Island, including Providence and Woonsocket. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our application package lays out the partnerships, business climate, quality of life and incentives that make Rhode Island attractive — and make our proposal competitive,” said R.I. Secretary of Commerce Stefan Pryor in a press release. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Amazon projects that the site of its next headquarters will receive over $5 billion in direct investments and close to $40 billion in indirect investments, based on investments since 2010 in its first headquarters in Seattle, according to its website. The company also estimates that the new headquarters will include 50,000 high-paying jobs. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“All the anchor institutions, cities and towns — everybody came together and put together one shining bid,” said Tom Giordano, executive director of the non-profit Partnership for R.I., a coalition of 12 local businesses, including the University. “You don’t really see that happen in too many places.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In its contribution to the Amazon proposal, the University helped develop the concept for an “Amazon Academy,” a direct response to Amazon’s request for an affiliated higher education program. Rhode Island’s universities would collaborate to develop special opportunities for Amazon employees. </span></p>
<p class="p4">“This would be a talent development partnership,” said Brian Clark, University spokesperson. “Amazon would need access to employment and training” that the University could provide in order to keep potential Amazon employees “up to date with the knowledge needed for the workplace.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Clark emphasized that employees in Amazon Academy might be drawn especially to the University’s School of Professional Studies master’s programs, the executive MBA program, the new data science initiative and the computer science program. The company’s presence could also benefit undergraduate students through potential internships and research opportunities, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Matt Sheaff, communications director for R.I. Commerce Corporation, stated that “no new public money” was spent on the campaign. It relied primarily on the local ad firm Nail, which was already on retainer by R.I. Commerce Corporation. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, Partnership for R.I. and its affiliated organizations invested in the proposal by producing marketing videos, funding architectural renderings from two different design firms and bringing together CEOs from leading R.I. companies like Hasbro and Blue Cross Blue Shield to offer testimonials, Giordano said. According to a source involved in the campaign, the Partnership for R.I. contributed between $50,000 and $150,000 in services to bolster the state’s proposal. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Amazon would be a good community partner,” said Neil Steinberg ’75, CEO of Rhode Island Foundation and co-founder of Partnership for R.I. “You could have Amazon people here who could serve on boards, be involved in philanthropic efforts — whether in social services or the arts — and you could have many individuals and executives who could be part of the community fabric.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though Steinberg and others acknowledge that many of the other cities submitting proposals, such as Pittsburgh or Atlanta, are considerably larger than Providence or any other R.I. city, they emphasize that the state’s small size does come with some advantages. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In a lot of other areas, Amazon would be competing directly with numerous other big companies,” said Barrett Hazeltine, professor emeritus of engineering. “But in Rhode Island there is a lot of space — It’s underused. And in Rhode Island, Amazon would really be king of the hill.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providence, in particular, has a strong transportation system in place that could be extremely useful to Amazon, with T.F. Green Airport, Amtrak and a major highway all located nearby, Hazeltine added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Another key facet of Rhode Island’s application included a series of architectural designs for the new headquarters. Preston Scott Cohen, an architect involved in the campaign, developed potential plans for a headquarters in the vicinity of the state capitol and championed Providence’s unique urban layout as an ideal location for Amazon. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In Providence, five things converge,” Cohen said. “There is the state house, the transportation hub of the train station, the downtown as a very clear and centralized and beautifully composed entity, the hills of the adjacent neighborhoods bringing a wonderful pedestrian environment and, finally, the close proximity of Brown, RISD and other universities.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even if the state’s bid for Amazon fails, Steinberg said the marketing campaign could still draw other companies or future investment from Amazon. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the last 20 months, the Ocean State has had a surge in business growth with 20 global companies expanding or establishing headquarters in Rhode Island, according to R.I. Commerce Corporation. And while Rhode Island lost out to Boston last year for General Electric’s new headquarters, GE decided to establish a digital division in Providence soon after. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In a short amount of time, we got the right people around a table to make a best effort pitch for (Rhode Island),” Steinberg said. “The state mobilized very well in gathering together its financial, human and technical resources to put Rhode Island’s best foot forward.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brett P. Smiley, Gov. Gina Raimondo’s chief of staff, came to the University Monday to talk about his experience in politics, his responsibilities as chief of staff and bipartisanship in the Rhode Island State House. The event was organized by No Labels at Brown University, a student organization that promotes bipartisan cooperation on campus to solve local and national problems.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Smiley began his speech by talking about his early career in politics, working on campaigns and in district offices in Illinois and California before coming to Rhode Island. He said that he decided to come to Rhode Island in January 2006 to work for then Lt. Gov. Charlie Fogarty. “I like to say that I moved here for a nine-month job 11 years ago and never left,” Smiley said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once he got to Providence, Smiley put down roots: he started his own political fundraising business and founded the Consulting Group, LLC, a political consulting firm. He also ran for mayor of Providence briefly but dropped out to help Mayor Jorge Elorza win the bid. He went on to work for Elorza for two years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this point in his career, Smiley maintains an open mind when it comes to potential clients: as a gay man, he wouldn’t work for anyone who is homophobic or a bigot, he said, but other than that, he is open to working with anyone, and “everything is negotiable.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the current Chief of Staff in the Raimondo administration, Smiley said he is responsible for balancing different political objectives, making difficult decisions on budgetary items and negotiating between a variety of stakeholders in the state. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moving forward, Smiley posed a couple of tips for what the Democratic Party needs to do in a post-2016 political climate. He posited that people prefer more authentic candidates who are not afraid of taking bold positions, adding that this was an important reason for Trump’s success. Mayors and governors should be more involved in the party too, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When Smiley opened the room for questions, one student asked how to push local political officials into making the jump to national offices.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In response, Smiley said that we have to convince local mayors and governors to run for federal positions, especially congress, because these local officials have a different approach to problem solving. This diversity of perspectives will benefit the federal government, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another student at the event asked Smiley how the decline of unions in the state might impact voting patterns, particularly as historical political coalitions built from them weaken.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Smiley said other demographic changes, like the growth of Latino populations in the state, has affected voting patterns more than the decline of unions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Smiley criticized the congress in the Trump administration as ineffective. Federal disfunction affects Rhode Island on the state level, he said, citing health care as a sector that has been under considerable stress in the state due to national policy uncertainty. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But there is hope for a bipartisan country, Smiley said, noting that, in spite of the high levels of national partisanship, Democrats and Republicans are working together on the opioid crisis, transportation infrastructure and power sector transformation.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">A chaotic scene unfurled at the rear of the Providence Place Mall Thursday when a man was shot dead by police on the Route 95 north ramp. The incident occurred shortly before 11 a.m., though both Providence and State police were on the scene hours after the shooting, huddling beside a bullet-ridden white Ford pickup truck.</p>
<p class="p4">At a press conference held on the ramp, Public Safety Commissioner Stephen Pare said police were investigating why the driver was driving erratically and why police were required to use deadly force to stop the car. He added that there was a woman in the passenger seat of the vehicle who had been taken to the hospital and that police were investigating her involvement in the matter.</p>
<p class="p4">Multiple videos of the incident on social media show numerous officers slowly approaching the vehicle before shots ring out. Media reports have been conflicting in regards to whether or not shots were fired from inside the vehicle before officers moved in.</p>
<p class="p4">The shootout was ultimately proven to be unrelated to the theft of a state police cruiser that occurred earlier Thursday. That incident involved Donald Morgan, a Providence resident who was getting transported in the cruiser to a court appearance after he was arrested and charged with obstruction and possession of a stolen motor vehicle Wednesday, State Police Col. Ann Assumpico said in a press conference.</p>
<p class="p4">At around 9:00 a.m. Morgan commandeered the cruiser while its officer exited to examine a car crash, Assumpico said.</p>
<p class="p4">She did not say how he was able to gain control of the vehicle, but did confirm that he had been in handcuffs at the time.</p>
<p class="p4">According to a Rhode Island State Police news brief released Thursday, the cruiser had been abandoned in Providence and was recovered shortly after the incident, though Morgan was still at large.</p>
<p class="p4">Assumpico hesitated when asked by a reporter whether or not Morgan should be considered dangerous. “We’re still looking into his history, but we definitely want him,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Elorza enacts municipal ID program for Providence</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/09/elorza-enacts-municipal-id-program-providence/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza signed an executive order to create a municipal ID program for the city Nov. 2. The program will draw upon the best practices of municipal ID programs implemented in other cities, including Washington D.C., New York City and Hartford, CT, said Victor Morente, the mayor’s press secretary. Morente expects the city to begin issuing ID cards in early 2018.</p>
<p class="p2">Elorza intends to make IDs available to all residents of Providence, including undocumented immigrants, Morente said. Other municipalities require ID card applicants to present a government-issued form of identification, such as a birth certificate or a passport, as well as a document that proves their residence within the city, such as an electrical bill, but do not require any documents pertaining to citizenship. By adopting the same requirements, Providence’s municipal ID program would allow immigrants to obtain ID cards and access city services regardless of their status in the U.S, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">But if the city maintains a database of municipal ID cardholders, immigrants who hold cards may risk becoming targets of the Department of Homeland Security, said Marcela Betancur, the policy associate for the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ACLU has voiced concerns that “if only undocumented people get (municipal IDs), then it’s going to be a very easy way to target that community.” To mitigate this risk, Betancur emphasized the importance of providing incentives to encourage other Providence residents to get municipal IDs and ensuring that the private information of ID cardholders “is not stored or shared with anyone.”</p>
<p class="p2">Morente said that the risk of storing ID cardholder data “is a concern we’ve heard and a concern we’ll keep in mind moving forward.” But he stressed that “this identification card is not just for immigrants,” emphasizing that the mayor will work to ensure that the ID program is “welcoming and accessible to all members of the community and not just the undocumented community.”</p>
<p class="p2">The executive order will benefit a variety of non-immigrant groups who tend to have trouble accessing suitable forms of identification, including “students, the homeless and members of the LGBTQ community,” Elorza said in a statement.</p>
<p class="p2">Morente listed a number of potential benefits the IDs may bring to these groups. For example: high school students in Providence may be able to use their IDs as RIPTA bus passes, gender non-binary residents will not need to select a gender for their ID cards and the homeless will be able to use their IDs to more easily access city services. He added that Elorza hopes to implement more generic ID card benefits, such as library card and debit card functions, to encourage more people to obtain a municipal ID.</p>
<p class="p2">Providence should consider drawing from the municipal ID programs of other cities to implement additional perks for ID cardholders, Bentacur said. She pointed to New York City’s IDNYC program, which gives ID cardholders discounts at some businesses and free entry to spaces such as museums.</p>
<p class="p2">City Councilman<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Luis Aponte said that there is “generally support for the idea” of municipal IDs among other council members, who approved a budget line item allocating $150,000 from the general fund to create the program in their June budget. But Aponte expressed some reservations about the implementation of the new program. He said the mayor’s office has focused primarily on what the ID cards “could and should do,” but he feels that “not enough emphasis was placed on what (ID cards) can’t do.”</p>
<p class="p2">“All the limitations and expectations of the program should be explained thoroughly to people when they apply” for an ID card, Aponte said. ID cardholders should know that a Providence ID is unlikely to be accepted in other municipalities and that a municipal ID card cannot completely replace state-issued forms of identification, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Aponte does not believe that his constituents in the Washington Park and Lower South Providence communities will be interested in obtaining municipal ID cards. “Out of many phone calls that I get from my constituents, … I have not gotten a phone call in almost 19 years asking for some form of municipal ID,” he said. “Unless there are incentives that you could not obtain otherwise, I’m not sure folks would view (municipal IDs) as something that would replace or augment what they have already in terms of identification,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">“My hope is that (the municipal ID card) is accepted and used, that there is a demand for the ID and that then we can start to evolve the idea of additional benefits working with private sector and nonprofit partners,” Aponte said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the midst of one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/opioid-crisis-public-health-emergency.html">deadliest public health crises</a> in U.S. history, President Trump has directed the Department of Health and Human Services to declare the opioid epidemic a “public health emergency,” a move he hopes will “liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction.” But Senator Jack Reed, D-RI, has criticized the declaration as an empty gesture.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many speculated prior to Trump’s announcement that the president might declare a national state of emergency, a move that would have automatically allocated funds to affected states. The public health emergency stops short of this, releasing no funds.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The opioid crisis is a national emergency that requires urgent care, attention and resources. The president’s response has been underwhelming,” Reed said in a press release.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo counts herself among those who believe the Trump Administration’s declaration is not enough. In an October press release, Raimondo condemned the president’s response, saying that she has “attended the funerals of too many constituents and too many of my friends’ kids who have lost their lives because of this crisis.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If we’re going to end it and save lives, states like Rhode Island need resources from the President and his administration, not rhetoric,” the release continued.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In 2016, the Ocean State saw 336 overdose deaths — a number that has risen each year since the data was first reported in 2009, according to PreventOverdoseRI.org, a website run by the State of Rhode Island and Brown’s School of Public Health. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The Governor believes that the opioid crisis is the most urgent public health challenge facing our state today,” said Catherine Rolfe, Raimondo’s deputy press secretary in an email to The Herald. While Rhode Island has taken significant actions to address the epidemic, Raimondo believes the state needs todo more to combat the crisis, Rolfe said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As part of an ongoing effort to reduce the number of overdose deaths in the state, the governor signed an executive order in 2015 creating the Overdose Prevention and Intervention Task Force. The task force names guidelines for the treatment of opioid addiction in hospitals and emergency departments and offers medication to state inmates to combat addiction while incarcerated. It is the first program of its kind, said Joseph Wendelken, public information officer for the Rhode Island Department of Health.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The state’s task force and associated Overdose Action Plan prioritize reducing the number of overdose deaths first, then attempt to address the wider problem of opiate addiction, said Brandon Marshall, associate professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health. Part of this effort involves increased <a href="https://www.apnews.com/f2d81a784a684d1f892a9c373f2a9843/Providence-City-Hall-installs-opioid-overdose-antidote-box">funding</a> for the distribution of Naloxone — an antidote to opioid overdose.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“What a lot of people don’t realize is that overdose is a relatively slow condition,” Marshall said, noting that it can often take one to two hours for a person overdosed on heroin to succumb, during which they could be resuscitated by Naloxone. Fentanyl, a relatively new illicit opiate, gives the rescuer less time, part of the reason why it poses such a danger.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For its part, Providence has installed a “NaloxBox” in City Hall. Designed by Geoff Capraro, professor of emergency medicine, along with a group from the Rhode Island School of Design, the box aims to distribute Naloxone to those who could intervene during an overdose. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The President is certainly right to call the scourge of opioid addiction a public health emergency,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) in a press release. “But to fight this emergency in earnest, we need more than declarations; we need full funding behind the Comprenhensive Additiction and Recovery Act Congress passed last year.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Whitehouse co-authored the act last year with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), seeking to “educate people about the consequences of drug abuse and to boost prevention efforts,” wrote a spokesperson on behalf of Whitehouse in a follow-up email to the Herald. “The legislation is helping family, friends and health care and law enforcement professionals in confronting an overdose. And it lends support to those following the long, noble path to recovery.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While former President Obama signed the bill into law in 2016, it still needs more funding to be effective, Whitehouse said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The number of people who die from opioid addiction is rising extremely fast,” said Marshall, who contributes to the state website.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Marshall, the opioid crisis rose from wide overprescription of opiate painkillers in the 1990s. That resulted in a “huge amount of opioids circulating in the community.” Many young people’s initial exposure to opioids is through prescription pills, but, as their dependency increases or their access to prescription drugs dries up, many transition into illicit drugs such as heroin or fentanyl, Marshall said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In 2016, illicit drugs caused 214 overdose deaths in Rhode Island, compared with just 31 deaths in 2009. Meanwhile, overdoses due to prescription drugs have decreased.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the crisis appears bleak, Marshall said that recent data suggest the trend of increasing death counts may be shifting. According to Marshall, the first six months of 2017 showed a 12 percent decrease in reported overdose deaths, a figure he calls “encouraging.”</span></p>
<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that <span class="s3">Raimondo believes the state needs to commit more funding to combat the opioid crisis. In fact, Raimondo believes the state needs to do more to combat the opioid crisis, not limited to funding. The Herald regrets the error. </span></strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Campus favorite Nitro Cart brewers will open their first brick and mortar cafe this winter at 288 Broadway in a space shared with DASH Bicycle Shop. With construction for The Nitro Bar already underway in the existing bike shop, both vendors are excited to collaborate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It has always been a pipe dream of mine to open up a space for a community of people, especially something around craft coffee that’s locally sourced and sustainable,” said Audrey Finocchiaro, one of The Nitro Cart’s two owners.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Serendipitously, DASH owner Leo LaBelle was looking to bring in a hip coffee retailer to fulfill his longtime goal of creating a combined coffee bar and bike shop — a concept he has seen in a few cities across the country, he said. With its loyal clientele, strong brand, established Instagram following and young employees (all under the age of 25), The Nitro Cart fit the bill.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The Nitro guys are onto a wave that we wouldn’t be able to keep up with,” LaBelle said. As a self-professed “old fart” at the age of 45, LaBelle expects that The Nitro Cart brand will prove a “good complement” to his existing store, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m a big fan of their brand,” said Sean Manning ’18.5, a loyal drinker of the nitro brew. “It’s cool seeing young people start a business like this.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The plan is to open The Nitro Bar in December, said Andrew Tower, the architect and interior designer working on the project. He envisions the bike service counter and the coffee bar in “a continuous line through the room,” with the mechanic and barista working side-by-side separated by a pane of glass, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re not trying to make anything too pretty or too fancy,” Tower said, adding that he wants to maintain the cool simplicity the coffee brand has maintained since its launch last September.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Nitro Cart started with just one cart in downtown Providence, Finocchiaro said. They soon added a second cart and brought both traveling coffee stations to campus, setting up shop on Waterman and George streets. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We really connect with the Brown students,” Finocchiaro said. “We feel very similar to you guys.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Business was good, and the company even installed nitro taps in some local restaurants, but the actual carts had to close for the winter. So when Labelle approached the cart owners this fall and asked if they would be interested in moving into part of his store to set up a nitro coffee bar, it posed a good business opportunity for the fledgling vendors, Finocchiaro said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“His clientele is similar to ours, which I think will work out well,” Finocchiaro said, adding that she would describe their shared customer base as “millennials” — even though she hates the word. And Rhode Island local Finocchiaro had always liked DASH’s neighborhood — the west side of Providence — because it reminds her of Brooklyn, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The coffee brewers’ 500-square-foot area within the bike shop “will be set up like a bar, with taps” of nitrogen-infused iced coffee, said Cole Criollos, a Nitro Cart employee.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Criollos mans The Nitro Cart on Waterman Street, but “probably won’t be out much longer” as the weather gets colder, he said. Now, with an indoor coffee bar at DASH, The Nitro Cart fans will have a home base all winter long.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We have this really awesome community of people we’ve built around The Nitro Cart, and we’re excited to hang out together,” Finocchiaro said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">LaBelle hopes The Nitro Bar will not only get people in the store, but also encourage them to spend time there, offering an opportunity for cyclists to bond in a relaxed atmosphere, he said. The “social aspect” of coffee has the power to bring people together, he said. “The whole point of cycling is to get more people into cycling. If we sit down and have a coffee together, … that coffee just brought us closer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">LaBelle estimates that currently, 80 to 90 percent of the store’s customers “will drop their bike off and go down the street to Seven Stars Bakery,” he said, adding that the in-house Nitro Bar will give these customers a more convenient option to grab a coffee as well as connect with fellow bikers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Seven Stars Bakery, just four blocks west of DASH, is not too concerned about losing business to The Nitro Bar. “We’re more so in competition with bakeries as opposed to coffee shops,” said Peyton Helgeson, a Seven Stars employee. “We have pretty good business,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Nitro Bar also doesn’t aim to take away business from any fellow cafes . “We don’t really think of people as competition because we’re doing our own thing and have this awesome community of supporters,” Finocchiaro said. “We feel positively toward other coffee shops.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to their signature nitro brew, The Nitro Bar will also introduce new nitro flavors and serve craft espresso drinks. They plan to sell around 10 varieties of Colombian pastries from Caprichos Antioqueños Bakery in Pawtucket, Finocchiaro said, adding that the authentic empanadas are one of her favorites. “I don’t know if I’ve ever tried something so good. It’s out of this world.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Loud conversation and the smell of meatloaf baking filled the entryway of All Saints Memorial Church in downtown Providence Nov. 14. At the church every Tuesday, the hungry and homeless can find a free and freshly cooked dinner provided by nonprofit City Meal Site. On that Tuesday night, the short, graying and flannel-clad Reverend Maryalice Sullivan greeted homeless and formerly homeless individuals. On their way out, the constituents were stopped by a few University students, who asked to discuss political advocacy for the homeless.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These students — members of the advocacy and outreach group Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere — were conducting the 2017 Government Relations Survey, which is used to determine high-priority legislative goals for homeless individuals. The GR survey has been used in past years to gather data for nonprofit groups that lobby for legislative action in the Rhode Island State House, said Gabriel Zimmerman ’18, co-director of HOPE. The survey was formerly administered by the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, but reduced funding limited RICH’s capacity to conduct the survey this year, he added. As a result, HOPE volunteered to redesign and conduct the GR survey in order to ensure its continued existence. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Redesigned survey tries to ask the right questions</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve decided there are some changes we wanted to make to” the GR survey, Zimmerman said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In redesigning the survey, the group changed the types of questions presented, said Morgan Talbot ’18, advocacy director for HOPE. Surveys in previous years have asked participants to identify the largest and most pressing issues facing homeless individuals, according to the 2016 survey. Access to affordable housing was the most pressing issue for almost half of those surveyed in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That pattern repeated itself in previous years, Talbot said, adding that it made the survey increasingly less useful in providing new information. “Part of the criticism of the survey in the past was that we tend to get some of the same responses every year,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This year, we’re focusing much more on concrete legislative actions that have been discussed previously by advocacy groups,” Talbot added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At All Saints Church Nov. 14, Talbot asked homeless individuals to choose three out of 10 possible legislative actions and prioritize them. Proposals on the list included making “it illegal for landlords to deny housing to someone based on source of income or having a Housing Choice (Section 8) Voucher” and funding “free child care for homeless families with children.” Other survey questions asked for ideas and opportunities not listed, as well as basic demographic information.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By the end of the night, Talbot, Zimmerman and other HOPE volunteers had collected roughly 20 surveys.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">HOPE has made several other changes to the survey collection method this year. For example, the group now conducts data collection in Spanish, as well as other languages if possible.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition, surveys have been collected in other parts of Providence as well as Pawtucket, Cranston, Westerly and Woonsocket, and group members will travel to Newport and Middletown later this week, Zimmerman said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By expanding the survey’s geographical range, HOPE has given advocacy groups a new asset in lobbying reluctant State House representatives. Non-profit groups and student activists hope to present representatives with data from their own districts and constituents, which should make lobbying more effective, said Will Gomberg ’20, one of two outreach coordinators for HOPE.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Legislative lobbying finds success</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The group will analyze the data and present it to a meeting of non-profit groups at RICH’s headquarters in the coming weeks, Talbot said. The State House session begins in January and ends in June, and HOPE and other Rhode Island nonprofits will base their lobbying campaigns off of the results of the survey, Zimmerman said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re aiming to get about 150 to 200 surveys” before Dec. 5, Gomberg said. But HOPE, with the assistance of teams from other student and off-campus groups, has far surpassed that number. As of Monday, the group had collected about 250 surveys and aims to have 300 by the end of the week, Zimmerman said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">HOPE has participated in several effective lobbying campaigns in the past. In spring 2017, HOPE students were active lobbyists and participants in the successful movement to restore the no-fare bus pass for low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities. The group also canvassed for an affordable housing bond initiative in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/11/04/hope-canvasses-affordable-housing-bond/">2016</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and lobbied successfully for a homeless bill of rights in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/09/11/ri-passes-first-homeless-bill-of-rights/">2012</a>, The Herald previously reported.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We always partner with existing community organizations if they’re already doing the work,” Zimmerman said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Student outreach tackles case management</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Students are often limited in their lobbying abilities by their academic time commitments, both Zimmerman and Gomberg said. In spite of those commitments, both outreach and advocacy have continued to grow. The HOPE outreach staff travels in teams of four or five, six nights a week on three different routes. Those routes travel through downtown Providence, the south side of Providence and Pawtucket.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">HOPE works through two primary avenues — direct service, called outreach, and political action, called advocacy. The group has expanded in recent years, growing from 45 members in spring 2017 to 75 members this semester. That has increased HOPE’s capacity for both direct service and advocacy, Zimmerman said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some students are also beginning to build “case management” skills, Gomberg said. For example, a group of HOPE students recently received a training on how to help homeless individuals obtain various forms of identification in order to successfully navigate the application process for housing vouchers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">HOPE’s growth into case management, expanded outreach and new survey leadership all stem from a central motivating mission, Zimmerman said. “HOPE’s goal is to eradicate homelessness. … We believe that direct service isn’t enough by itself. There has to be a structural aspect to make change in the community,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the meal site Nov. 14, Zimmerman spoke with Reverend Sullivan at the doorway during a pause in the collection of surveys. Systemic change to the problem of homelessness “would be my dream,” Sullivan said. “Society as a whole needs to grasp that there are those who have literally nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A few days before the trip to the City Meal Site, Zimmerman explained his dedication to HOPE while rain lashed against the window. “Once a week, you take two hours … and you have conversations with people who are literally in this weather living on the street,” Zimmerman said. It “reinforces how much more we have to do on behalf of the Providence community.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Updated Dec. 5 at 1:17 p.m.</strong>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Members of the Providence community gathered at a Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council meeting Tuesday in protest of National Grid’s proposal to build a liquefied natural gas production plant at Fields Point. CRMC is the state entity that will ultimately decide whether the $100 million project is installed or not. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the hearing, protesters expressed their concerns regarding the environmental and social hazards this facility could cause. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We don’t want them spending a hundred million dollars to build this toxic facility that is using fossil fuels to destroy the planet and to keep destroying our neighborhood,” said Monica Huertas, campaign coordinator for the No LNG in PVD movement. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During Tuesday’s hearing, National Grid representatives declined to comment. But National Grid’s website says the LNG facility will help supply New England National Grid customers with up to 40 percent of the gas they would need during the coldest part of the year. It also says “the facility would be a reliable, safe, cost-effective way to ensure that (their) customers have the natural gas they need to heat their homes and businesses, particularly when the demand is greatest.”</span></p>
The "facility would be a reliable, safe, cost-effective way to ensure that our customers have the natural gas they need to heat their homes and businesses, particularly when the demand is greatest," wrote National Grid Director of Communications Ted Kresse in an email to The Herald. "Liquefied natural gas is already stored at the site. What we are proposing would change the way we fill the existing tank, by installing liquefaction equipment on the same property."
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Ward 3 City Council Member for, Nirva LaFortune, told The Herald: “This is environmental discrimination and I think it’s unfair and unethical. These kids are breathing toxins on a daily basis, and they’re from immigrant families and people of color. We need to be more ethical, and we need to think about the type of facilities that we’re bringing into these communities because we’re destroying it.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island published a paper claiming that South Providence, where the installment of the power plant is expected, has concentrated poverty and communities of color. It also has little to no waterfront access in an area zoned for heavy industrial use with multiple polluting and hazardous facilities. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mayor Jorge Elorza has publicly stated that he opposes the development of the facility as “it presents danger to the neighborhood, especially in the face of a changing climate.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elorza signed an executive order last year committing Providence to becoming a carbon neutral city by 2050.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Furthermore, State Rep. Aaron Regunberg ’12, D-Providence, told The Herald that he has been against the project since it was originally proposed. “We need to be making a rapid transition to clean energy. If we want to lower costs, we need to have our own independent clean energy sector right here in Rhode Island,” said Regunberg.</span></p>
<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that </strong><span class="s1"><strong>Invenergy, the company that provides the funds for the construction of the facility, announced last week that the facility’s opening, originally planned for 2020, is now postponed to 2021. It also stated that Ted Kresse, a spokesperson from National Grid, told The Herald that though National Grid was set to deliver the facility by 2020, the Clear River Energy Center “has not provided the required security nor authorized National Grid to proceed,” causing the project to be delayed. In fact, this was referring to a separate natural gas plant that is being funded by Invenergy. The Herald regrets the errors. </strong></span></em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a community-wide email sent yesterday, President Christina Paxson P’19 announced the University’s proposal to work with Prospect Medical Holdings — a California-based hospital chain — in merging with Care New England, the second largest health care system in Rhode Island. The University’s offer arrives amid efforts by Partners HealthCare, the largest health care system in Massachusetts, to acquire CNE.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CNE, which lost over $53 million in 2016, owns Women &amp; Infants, Butler, Memorial and Kent Hospitals in Rhode Island. CNE and Partners announced in April 2017 that they were exploring merger options, as GoLocal Prov <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/business/care-new-england-signs-agreement-with-partners-healthcare-for-potential-mer">previously reported</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a conference call with members of the press, Paxson said the University’s concern with Partners stems from the fact that it is not a local health care system, adding that “its center of gravity is in Massachusetts.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CNE’s acquisition by Partners, which also operates Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, would likely shift specialty health care to the neighboring state, limiting access to health care “for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rhode Islanders and especially for members of the state’s underserved communities,” according to Paxson’s email.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“My concern is that if specialty care moves north, then the doctors and researchers who supply that care will not want to be in Rhode Island,” Paxson told the press. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This shift could increase the costs of health care, wrote Cass Cliatt, vice president for communications, in an email to The Herald. Citing a 2015 <a href="http://www.ohic.ri.gov/documents/Report-2015-Total-Cost-Of-Care-Study.pdf">cost of care study</a>, Cliatt wrote that Rhode Island currently has “substantially lower professional costs than Massachusetts and the New England Region. … Shifting patients out of state would increase costs to consumers, payers (insurance companies, the state) and employers.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This shift would also hinder “the full economic benefits of a strong local academic health system that brings in federal grants, generates spin-off companies and creates new jobs in Rhode Island,” according to Paxson’s email. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brown-Prospect plan includes provisions for the University, or another nonprofit subsidiary of Brown, to acquire the Women &amp; Infants Hospital while allowing Prospect to acquire Kent and its “non-hospital assets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">such as The Providence Center community mental health organization,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Paxson wrote. If CNE allows discussions to move forward, the University and Prospect would determine the acquisition of Butler in the future. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Under its proposal, the University would also invite “the medical school faculty </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at Women &amp; Infants, Butler and Kent … to join a Brown faculty practice plan or to become Brown employees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” according to Paxson’s email. Additionally, Brown would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinvest the majority of any operating margins it receives into clinical care, medical research and education.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The uncertainty surrounding the “status of the acquisition of Care of New England by Partners … (and) uncertainty among people in the state” delayed the University’s announcement of its proposal, Paxson told the press. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Partners and CNE announced that they would be extending merger talks through Jan. 31, according to the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/12/27/partners-healthcare-system-extend-merger-talks/oFgQgQOvgDX1MJKw1Uc3YL/story.html">Boston Globe</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The University will submit its plan to CNE for consideration “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if the Partners acquisition does not go forward, either because Partners withdraws, or its application to the state is denied,” according to Paxson’s email. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the University’s proposal has received criticism from CNE and other stakeholders.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Beardsworth, spokesman for CNE, said the Brown-Prospect plan “represents their intention to acquire and split up the Care New England Health System — a process undertaken of their own independent action and interests,” WPRI <a href="http://wpri.com/2018/01/11/brown-u-prospect-reveal-they-want-to-buy-care-new-england-hospital-group/">reported</a>. Beardsworth added that CNE intends to continue its discussions with Partners.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Paxson told the press that CNE’s reaction to the deal was surprising, but that “we are outlining an alternative that seeks to assist Care of New England by offering … to join with them in keeping health care in Rhode Island.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re taking a position on an issue of vital public importance,” she said. Paxson added that she “thought it was just important to make it clear that there are other options that the people of Rhode Island can consider.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The University has also been criticized for partnering with Prospect to develop an alternative deal. The United Nurses and Allied Professionals union raised questions about Prospect’s safety record, citing issues with “patient infection and injury,” the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180111/brown-pitches-rival-deal-for-care-new-england">reported</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But Cliatt reiterated the University’s support for Prospect. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prospect’s hospitals in Rhode Island have received national recognition for the quality of care they deliver,” Cliatt wrote. “Brown feels that the significant investments Prospect has made in its facilities, technology and people in Rhode Island reflect its strong, continued commitment to Rhode Island and its health care system.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same conference call, Thomas Reardon, president of Prospect Medical Holdings East, said Prospect looked forward to working with “the University, physicians, elected officials and the community to … ensure all Rhode Islanders continue to have access to quality, locally-driven health care.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Paxson said that despite being a California-based, for-profit company, Prospect does not intend to move research and specialty practice out of Rhode Island, the Journal reported. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the merger between CNE and Partners is successful, the University is “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">committed to working with Partners to maintain the productive relationship that Brown has enjoyed with CNE,” according to Paxson’s email.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Herald could not reach representatives from Partners and Care New England for comment by press time. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">A 17-year-old has been arrested in an attempted shooting that took place in the second-level parking garage of the Providence Place Mall Jan. 15. The 19-year-old victim, identified as Leonard Liriano on the Providence Police Department’s Twitter, was shot in the leg but not fatally wounded.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooter was arrested in his Pawtucket home the night of the shooting, Providence Police Chief Hugh Clements Jr. told <a href="http://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/01/16/providence-place-mall-shooting-arrest/">CBS Boston</a>. He was charged with and arrested for conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon, according to <a href="http://wpri.com/2018/01/16/suspect-17-arrested-in-connection-with-providence-place-mall-shooting/">WPRI</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While speaking to WPRI, Clements said that more arrests may take place and that the shooting may have been related to gang activity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What began as an altercation between the two men moved from the second-level walkway to Nordstrom’s and finally to the parking garage, where it turned into an attempted shooting. Officers swarmed the building and, in an attempt to bring the gunman out of the mall itself, commanded everyone inside to leave immediately. The gunman escaped, leaving the victim to recover from wounds on his leg. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the mall announced that shoppers were to evacuate the facility, many were initially unsure why. Word of the shooting spread slowly through the crowds, witnesses told the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180115/police-man-shot-at-providence-place-shoppers-evacuated-suspect-sought--video">Providence Journal</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After being arrested, the shooter was taken to Rhode Island Training School, Clements told WPRI. He appeared before a Family Court judge and was released on home confinement. The suspect’s pretrial hearing is scheduled for Feb. 13.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to WPRI, Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza called the suspect a “knucklehead” and emphasized the increased safety Providence has seen in the last few years.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>City offers advice, new programs for small business owners</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/24/city-offers-advice-new-programs-small-business-owners/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Providence small business owners gathered Tuesday night for a community forum hosted by Mayor Jorge Elorza in the Joseph A. Doorley Jr. Municipal Building to highlight new opportunities for loans and programs designed to streamline business development.</p>
<p class="p4">“Small business is the lifeblood of the community,” Elorza told the mostly Latinx audience, as an interpreter translated his words into Spanish.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza presented the Office of Economic Opportunity’s Providence Self-Employment Program, aimed to offer unemployed and underemployed residents the opportunity to gain financial literacy and business skills.</p>
<p class="p4">The Self-Employment Program was created to aid the lengthy loan application process. To qualify for loans and expanded city support, entrepreneurs need to present a profitable business idea with a well-constructed business plan. This process can be difficult for people without prior experience or business education, said Maryellen O’Mahony, director for the Center for Women and Enterprise.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s really hard to make a business plan. You need to really know all the necessary mechanics,” said O’Mahony, whose organization will provide free classes and one-on-one mentorship to 100 Providence residents and 125 Spanish-speaking residents through the Self-Employment Program.</p>
<p class="p4">The initiatives are in part meant to bolster an already existing mandate in which at least 10 percent of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Providence business contracts go to companies run by women and at least 10 percent of bids for city-funded projects are given to minority-owned companies, according to State Rep. Grace Diaz, D-Providence.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The key, Diaz said, is to expand the pool of minority- and women-owned companies eligible to receive city contracts, especially for construction work. She noted the importance of reaching out to Providence’s large Latino population.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“Latinos have less access to capital — they are often coming from low-income families, which makes it hard for them to put up their own capital up front,” Diaz said. “They still need capital, and I think the city can help make the process clearer and simpler.”</p>
<p class="p4">Early stage entrepreneur funding is limited and, as a result, it’s important for applicants to be prepared and technically well-versed in the business world, said Brian Hull, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity for Providence.</p>
<p class="p4">“You are not going to get a long-term loan for your start-up without demonstrating a business plan and a bankable business idea,” Hull said. Educational initiatives like the Self-Employment Program are crucial to build up necessary skill sets, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">The city must extend support to small business owners to expand their businesses, said Tom Hoagland, director of the Providence Business Loan Fund.</p>
<p class="p4">“Big banks are not as well-equipped anymore to deal with small businesses,” Hoagland said.</p>
<p class="p4">Some businesses, like restaurants and beauty salons, can have trouble obtaining funds from large banks because they have a high turnover rate and are considered risky, with limited profitability, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">The PBLF offers loans of $50,000 to $250,000 for established businesses that have had their loan applications turned down by local banks, and hopes to inject nearly $2 million into Providence businesses over the next three years.</p>
<p class="p4">Hoagland encouraged business owners in the room to approach him for advice and share what they learned with their colleagues.</p>
<p class="p4">“The process to get a small business loan is very tedious,” said Roberto Castellanos, who operates a dry cleaning business with 10 employees. “It’s a lot of work, and it costs a lot of money, and while there’s been a lot of effort to make progress, there are still a lot of challenges.”</p>
<p class="p4">Following the speeches and a question-and-answer session, representatives from a variety of organizations, such as Goldman Sachs’ 10,000 Small Businesses program, handed out flyers and answered questions.</p>
<p class="p4">Juana Flores, who owns a clothing store called Bella Boutique, said she planned to share the information with her two daughters, who each run their own cleaning businesses. She hopes they can all qualify for loans to expand their businesses.</p>
<p class="p4">“I feel content because I learned a lot,” Flores said. “There is help offered, projects open for us, and we want to be part of them.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>RISD to offer inaugural liberal arts graduate programs</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/24/risd-offer-inaugural-liberal-arts-graduate-programs/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island School of Design is bolstering its selection of graduate degrees by offering its first-ever graduate school programs in the liberal arts departments. This fall, students will be able to pursue Master of Arts degrees in the new Global Arts and Culture program as well as the Nature-Culture-Sustainability Studies program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The NCSS<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>program emerges from a current undergraduate concentration, whereas the GAC program is completely new, said Eric Anderson, associate professor of history of art and visual culture. They are made possible through interdisciplinary cooperation among the three liberal arts programs already offered at RISD: History of Art and Visual Culture; Literary Arts and Studies; and History, Philosophy and Social Sciences, said Nicole Merola, department head and professor of literary arts and studies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The programs were inspired by an interest in taking advantage of the untapped potential of collaboration between the departments, said Andrew Robarts, assistant professor of history, philosophy and social sciences. RISD’s approach to liberal arts is unique in that it is not constrained by boundaries that exist at traditional liberal arts colleges, Anderson said.</span></p>
<p class="p4">To implement the changes, the faculty and dean involved in the new programs have been working to develop curricula, recruit prospective students, construct the website and converse internally. The majority of their work has gone into developing the core courses, Anderson said. In creating these courses, those involved identified the intellectual content of the courses and considered how they wanted to incorporate them into the syllabi.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the core courses for GAC is “Critical Globalisms,” which intends to expose students to global exchange, economy, politics and production of art and literatures. The purpose of the program is to provide an overall theoretical framework for future studies, Anderson said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Students of NCSS will take “Theories of Nature Culture,” which is likewise meant to provide a theoretical framework, and “Inventive Political Ecologies,” which focuses on creative production in the arts and humanities as it relates to environment and nature, Anderson said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The faculty involved are waiting to see how these new programs will become a part of RISD, Robarts said. Current undergraduate students may be good candidates, since they already know and have potentially worked with the faculty, he added. Those involved in the programs may also consider students coming from undergraduate programs at more traditional colleges.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">RISD’s culture has always been closely tied to critical and theoretical inquiry as well as the liberal arts, and these new graduate programs will build upon this legacy, Anderson said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gov. Gina Raimondo’s administration unveiled a $9.38 billion budget that would finance $250 million in public school reparations and allocate $3 million to growing the state’s small businesses, while relying upon sports betting — should it be legalized by the Supreme Court this year — to bring in $23.5 million of new revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Much of the state’s numbers depend on outcomes in Washington, such as whether or not the Children’s Health Insurance Program will be reauthorized.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This is a difficult budget environment,” said Michael DiBiase, the director of the Department of Administration who managed Raimondo’s proposal. “We have a lot of uncertainty in Washington.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">New sources of revenue also include increased compassion centers (sites where patients with qualifying conditions can obtain medical marijuana), new co-pay fees on non-disabled adult Medicaid enrollees and a cloud-based software tax, which would tax software like Microsoft Office 365. These sources will be needed to fund large new expenditures, such as the $6.4 million going to the RI Promise campaign and paying back cities and towns as the state phases out the car tax, on top of the projected $260 million deficit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raimondo’s budget does not propose broad-based tax increases. Raimondo’s introduction to the budget expressed optimism for the state, which is at its lowest unemployment rate since March 2001 at 4.3 percent. But Rhode Island has posted job losses in four out of the last five months.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As state and local officials come to understand how federal tax reform will affect them, many have voiced concerns that their budgets could suffer, despite President Trump and many lawmakers’ promises that it would instead bolster state finances.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some budget analysts, like the right-leaning Tax Foundation, argue that the new tax law broadens taxable items at both the state and federal level and brings in potential new revenue for the state by eliminating certain deductions. But Rhode Island state tax officials have said that because they rely less on the federal personal tax income, they do not expect to see these gains.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This month the R.I. House of Representatives will open itself for hearings before they pass a revised version, likely this summer. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Education</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to the updates on public school facilities, Raimondo’s other proposed ballot measures include $25 million to improve the University of Rhode Island campus at Narragansett Bay, $25 million for renovations at Rhode Island College, and a $48.5 million green economy and clean water fund that would protect the state’s waters and remediate industrial sites for redevelopment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Between FY15 and FY19, the budget for commerce, the Department of Business Regulation, higher education and elementary and secondary education has grown by nearly 4 percent, or around $270 million.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The FY19 budget also proposes $1.1 million toward expanding pre-kindergarten programs and $1.5 million for infant and toddler childcare.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Medicaid changes</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raimondo’s plan would charge Medicaid enrollees new co-payments between $2 and $8 on services that tend to be overused, said Patrick Tigue, Medicaid program director for the Office of Health and Human Services. Non-disabled adult enrollees would pay a co-pay of $8 on non-emergency emergency room visits, $3 for non-preventative physician visits, $4 for name brand prescription drugs, $2.50 for generics and $3 for inpatient hospitalizations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While people with disabilities and elderly people make up only 20 percent of Medicaid enrollees, they account for 59 percent of the state’s expenditures, according to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The new budget proposal targets adults without disabilities; still, Eric Beane, secretary of the Office of Health and Human Services, said the new fees would add up to $3.2 million in new revenue.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The changes would bring Rhode Island in line with 24 other states, including Massachusetts, that have instated these types of co-payments, Beane added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b> Rhode Islanders in need</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The plan would use $1.7 million from the state’s general fund to extend the care of Department of Children, Youth and Families for foster children aged 18-21 that decide to opt back into its services. The state would also increase the rates paid to foster families by adding $1.3 million to its budget, bringing those rates on par with Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The budget also makes provisions to address the state’s opioid crisis, which caused 233 overdose deaths between January and September 2017. The budget outlines a new “Behavioral Health Link” resource that would connect those with mental health concerns to treatment resources and keep them out of the justice system. Raimondo also hopes to establish a job-training program for those with substance abuse issues.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Under the proposed budget, the state would add 12 new medical marijuana compassion centers to its current three. Raimondo would also allow patients from Connecticut and Massachusetts to access medical marijuana in Rhode Island, although the former is set to open recreational marijuana shops in July 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the upfront costs of opening the compassion centers, state officials said they expect to see a net revenue by broadening its customer base, as well as by expanding the options to receive a medical marijuana card.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Business</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The state would also see new revenue by taxing cloud-based services, such as TurboTax, a service that users pay for through the Internet but do not download onto their computer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">In her budget, Raimondo also set aside $475,000 for a new SupplyRI program, which would connect large buyers with in-state smaller suppliers. The plan would also add $500,000 to the small business loan fund, doubling the number of loans added this year.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Rhode Island State Representative Robert Lancia R-16 proposed a bill on Thursday that aims to increase the number of children who can afford to attend private school. Lancia’s House Bill 7055 would allow for total business donations to need-based scholarships, in exchange for a tax credit, to reach $5 million, as opposed to the $1.5 million cap previously determined by a 2013 House bill, said Sheila Konis, director of Rhode Island Families for School Choice. Bill 7055 comes in honor of National School Choice Week, an annual event that highlights the variety of educational options for students in Rhode Island and beyond.</p>
<p class="p4">“Fifteen thousand families are underserved educationally in Rhode Island, and the graduation rate at the Community College of Rhode Island is 3 to 14 percent,” Lancia said, adding that he believes House Bill 7055 will connect students with the educational environment best fit to help them succeed. Lancia presented a similar bill last year, House Bill 6031, that died in the Finance Committee, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">The state government began exploring avenues to fund non-public school options for students in 2006. They passed a bill that allowed corporations to receive a tax credit in exchange for donating to organizations that award need-based scholarships for private education, Konis said.</p>
<p class="p4">The newly proposed state budget of $9.4 billion means that Rhode Island can afford to give up taxes from businesses that are allowed to donate to scholarship funds, Lancia said. With a $1.5 million cap, only a fraction of a percent of the students in Rhode Island currently use scholarships from tax credit, said Jonathan Butcher, a senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation. Allowing for more business investment in need-based academic scholarships may improve graduation rates as a result of increased school choice for students, Butcher added, citing case studies in Washington, D.C. and Milwaukee.</p>
<p class="p4">“We have great public schools here, but some students need more than what their town public school is able to give them,” Konis said.</p>
<p class="p4">Last year, 130 businesses applied for the tax credit through a lottery, but only 15 received it. If all 130 businesses were granted the tax credit, there would have been a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>$5.2 million increase in scholarship funds available, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“But we’re capped at $1.5 million,” Konis said. “That makes no sense.”</p>
<p class="p4">Members of the Catholic School Parent Federation of Rhode Island showed up for the presentation of the bill.</p>
<p class="p4">“The bill is important to us in Catholic schools because an increase in the corporate tax scholarship program will make more money available to offset costs for children in Catholic schools,” said Erin Clark, a member of the federation. “Even a small scholarship amount can really make a difference in whether you can necessarily enroll in Catholic school or not.”</p>
<p class="p4">Lancia presented the bill in the midst of a celebration of School Choice Week at the State House, with performances by the St. Pius V school choir, the St. Rose of Lima school band and an introduction by Jason Botel from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Providence, RIPTA launch electric-assist bike program</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The city of Providence will introduce 400 electric-assist bikes this summer through New England’s first electric bike-share system, following a deal with JUMP Bikes signed Dec. 15.</p>
<p class="p4">“A bike-share program positions Providence to be a more sustainable, healthier and fun city for years to come,” said Mayor Jorge Elorza in a recent press release. “We are thrilled to be among the first cities in the region to offer these bikes that will allow residents and visitors to explore the capital city in a unique and exciting way.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority will be partnering with the city to provide financial support by administering federal funding through a $400,000 Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant, according to Barbara Polichetti, director of public affairs for RIPTA.</p>
<p class="p4">The grant is part of a new mobility initiative focused on expanded investment in the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/11/ripta-holds-community-meeting-discuss-new-bus-routes/#disqus_thread">Downtown Transit Connector project</a>, an improved bus corridor under construction in Providence, said Victor Morente, press secretary for the Mayor’s Office.</p>
<p class="p4">Each e-bike have a pedal assist motor, allowing them to reach speeds of up to 20 miles per hour, making it easier to climb hills and travel for long distances. Equipped with U-locks, e-bikes will be able to be locked anywhere in the city, within certain boundaries.</p>
<p class="p4">The Brooklyn-based bike company has installed over 12,000 dockless bicycles in over 40 markets, including Washington, D.C. and Portland.</p>
<p class="p4">The bike-share program will rely on a monthly membership of $20 per month, including one hour free per day. However, the city will also offer discounted memberships of $20 a year for low-income households earning less than 80 percent of Providence’s median income, Morente said.</p>
<p class="p4">Providence residents will also be able to use a “pay as you go” rate of $2 for the first 30 minutes, and then on a per minute rate afterwards.</p>
<p class="p4">The program would complement RIPTA’s mission to reduce the amount of vehicles on Providence roads, further benefiting the environment, Politchetti said.</p>
<p class="p4">All RIPTA fixed-route buses are equipped with two bicycle carriers, so people who choose to bike will be able to still use the bus system. “We have a lot of bicyclists who commute to work every day using their bikes for the first and last miles of their trips and using RIPTA to round out the route,” Polichetti wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">The city and parterning company JUMP Bikes will be hosting several public meetings to receive input from community members about potential locations for bike-share stations, Morente said. Further information regarding the meetings will be released in the next month, he added.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re excited to bring JUMP Bikes to Providence,” said Ryan Rzepecki, founder and CEO of JUMP Bikes in a press release. “The city has committed to making bicycling a viable transportation option for local residents and is poised to become a leader for the future of sustainable transportation. Our e-bikes will transform Providence for residents and visitors, making communities feel closer than ever and bringing new excitement to bike riding.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to the bike share program, Providence is investing more than $10,000,000 into improving its bicycle infrastructure by implementing more bike lanes, off-road bike paths and racks, Morente said. The investment, taking place over the course of the next three years, is the result of a partnership with the organization PeopleForBikes, which is working with nine other U.S. cities to bolster urban bicycling. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Regunberg ’12 to run for R.I. lieutenant governorship</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Aaron Regunberg ’12 announced his candidacy for lieutenant governor Oct. 24. Challenging incumbent Daniel McKee, Regunberg sees the office as an opportunity to tackle President Trump’s agenda and represent Rhode Islanders rather than corporations, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">As state representative for House district four since 2014, Regunberg has seen that everyday Rhode Islanders are underrepresented. “Well-connected institutions in the state … are always present in the State House, every room, every hallway, every fundraiser, while Rhode Islanders who can’t afford a well-connected statehouse lobbyist (are) too often … ignored,” he said. Regunberg said he sees the greatest political challenge facing Rhode Island as “the way the system feels rigged both politically and economically.”</p>
<p class="p4">Previously, Regunberg has sponsored a bill mandating paid sick days and an increase to the minimum wage for tipped employees. In addition to introducing a single-payer health care initiative for Rhode Island, Regunberg has been active in opposing Trump's agenda. Regunberg organized a “Resist Hate RI” meeting of over 1,000 people at Hope High School in Providence and a rally outside the State House following the presidential election.</p>
<p class="p4">Regunberg tried to help people becoming politically active for the first time “channel their energy” into “grassroots lobbying, door-knocking and plugging into some of the different legislative campaigns — an example, paid sick days — that wouldn’t have happened if over 7,000 Rhode Islanders” hadn’t make phone calls to their legislators.</p>
<p class="p4">At 27, Regunberg finds it difficult to be taken seriously as a candidate, he wrote in an email to The Herald. However, he believes young people must be involved with politics. “Young people are going to be impacted by the political decisions made today for a long time, and if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">His progressive campaign has elicited support from young people, including Brown students. “I heard about (Regunberg) as someone who was challenging Dan McKee … from the left, as a more progressive Democrat,” said Alex Floyd ’18, a press intern for the Regunberg campaign.</p>
<p class="p4">“We don’t technically endorse anyone, but it’s great to see a former alum run, as well as see a lot of progressive initiatives on the agenda for him,” said Alyssa Sanders ’20, communications director of the Brown Democrats.</p>
<p class="p4">As lieutenant governor, Regunberg hopes to make the role a “blowhorn” for the people of Rhode Island, amplifying voices more than a state representative can, said Rose Lang-Maso ’20, a campaign intern.</p>
<p class="p4">Regunberg described the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor as a race to decide Democratic priorities. Though Regunberg respects the party, “things like the state party endorsement are not going to be the biggest priority” for the campaign, he said. Instead, Regunberg’s campaign website lists his priorities as “guaranteeing access to healthcare, transitioning to 100 percent clean energy, standing up for a woman’s right to choose, defending hard-working immigrants and supporting our public schools.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Originally from Chicago, Regunberg came to Providence in 2008 to attend Brown, where he concentrated in political science. Even as a student, his passion was to be involved in service work in Providence. “That was sort of my entry into the local community,” he said. Co-founding the Providence Student Union showed him “the impact that (young people) could have … in the decisions that impact them,” Regunberg said. This experience with community organizing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ultimately convinced Regunberg to pursue politics.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Regunburg’s first experience with a campaign was working for Angel Taveras, who became Providence’s first Hispanic mayor.</p>
<p class="p4">Ultimately, Regunberg hopes that “Rhode Island can be a real model for the country — not just a leader in the resistance to the Trump agenda, but a model for the kind of bold, positive alternative vision that the Democratic party needs to offer if we’re going to have a shot at winning back power.” Rhode Island has the chance to lead the way in a “transition to a clean energy economy,” for instance, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Nationally, “the biggest challenge right now is that … all three branches of our national government are controlled by the most radical political party that I think we’ve ever seen in this country,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">The primary election will take place Sept. 12.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Committee of Finance reviews budget projections</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Providence Committee on Finance convened Tuesday evening in City Hall to discuss the city’s projected budget for the next five years. At the meeting, committee members expressed concerns about the management of the school system’s finances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bulk of the committee’s agenda was devoted to a review of the five-year budget projections for Fiscal Years 2019-23. The city government is projected to be “at budget or better” for FY 2018-19, said Finance Director Lawrence Mancini. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The city ended the last fiscal year with a $5.4 million surplus, Mancini said. “It is the essential task of government to yield a balanced budget,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Toward the end of Mancini’s budget presentation, he admitted this surplus did not extend to the budget for Providence city schools, which is calculated separately from that of the city’s.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The school budget continues to show deficits in all years, including the most recent year ahead, FY 2019,” Mancini said. The<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>deficit is projected to be “slightly over $3.5 million” for FY 2019, he added. But Mancini said that whenever he meets with school officials, he is assured that “no matter what, it will come in as a balanced budget.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">City Council Chair John Igliozzi, in particular, expressed frustration with the school budgeting. “I know they’re going to come up with a balanced budget. Everybody comes up with a balanced budget,” he said. But submitting a balanced budget is “the easy part” and even “disingenuous,” because officials can project developments such as increases in enrollment that do not actually materialize.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A balanced projected budget is nothing more than “the work of fiction,” Igliozzi said, which allows the school administrators to “blame the legislature and the executive (when) they have to fund the cuts or raise taxes to pay for their work of fiction.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s not that people haven’t given them money,” Igliozzi said. Throughout his time on the committee, the school board has asked for more money in “six-month cycle(s)” and repeatedly spent it all, he added. This is “the business of the school department in Providence. … It’s not anyone in particular’s fault, it’s just the nature of that business,” Igliozzi said. But this business is “bad for the people of Providence, because they sell a book of fiction, and the rest of us have to sell the book of reality. I don’t think it’s fair.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The state is, right now, somewhat short with money, so they’re looking for cuts and changes,” Igliozzi said. “We need to give the people of Providence an understanding of where we are, because things have to change.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Mayor Jorge Elorza spoke about his vision and goals for education reform with Providence residents at Vartan Gregorian Elementary School Tuesday night. The event was a part of the “Citywide Conversation Series,” a mayoral initiative aimed at improving communication between residents and local officials.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza’s education plan targets improvements in physical infrastructure and learning techniques.</p>
<p class="p4">“Children deserve to study in a classroom that inspires them to learn,” Elorza said, adding that several schools have classrooms with mold and inadequate heating. Over the next 10 years, the mayor’s office plans to invest up to $400 million in school infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p4">In addition to improvements to school buildings, the investment will focus on technological innovation.“Technology is a tool that can be used to customize learning for students,” Elorza said, reaffirming his goal to achieve a 1-to-1 student to technology ratio.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza hopes to complement improvements in equipment by investing in summer enrichment programs to prevent students from falling behind during long breaks.</p>
<p class="p4">There is a link between education and a reduced crime rate, Elorza said. His administration invested $1 million in a summer job program intended to mitigate street violence in Providence. The program provides students with internships at non-profits such as the Institute for the Study and Practice of Nonviolence.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza also responded to concerns about racial and cultural bias in schools by elaborating on the importance of positive role models for students. The administration has $750,000 for school culture coordinators, who bring guest speakers and mentors to strengthen the emotional support available for middle school students, Elorza said.</p>
<p class="p4">During the discussion session following his talk, community members raised concerns and questions for the mayor. In response to a question about his criteria and model for school reform, Elorza outlined a three-phase process, which includes forming a vision with the community, allocating investments and implementing the ideas efficiently.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza opened his talk by reaffirming the administration’s other key priorities, which include finances, infrastructure and accessibility. “Due to large operating surpluses, the short-term finances are in the strongest shape they have been in,” Elorza said, adding that he hopes to improve pensions and address issues such as uneven sidewalks and potholes.</p>
<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the mayor's office plans to invest $400 million in schooling. In fact, the mayor's office plans to invest up to $400 million in school infrastructure. In addition, the article also stated that the administration spent $75,000 on school culture coordinators. In fact, the administration has allocated $750,000 for school culture coordinators. The Herald regrets the errors.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b>Bills introduced to increase minimum wage, close gender pay gap</b></p>
<p class="p3">Rhode Island’s progressive Democrats launched a coordinated campaign to raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour during a press conference Tuesday. Titled “Fight for $15 and Fair Pay,” the campaign began when legislators, workers and advocacy groups gathered at the State House to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/143757739670882/">introduce</a> two new pieces of legislation.</p>
<p class="p3">The minimum wage bill, sponsored by Sen. Jeanine Calkin, D-Warwick and Rep. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell, D-Providence, aims to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023; thereafter, the wage would rise with inflation.</p>
<p class="p3">The Fair Pay bill, sponsored by Sen. Gayle Goldin, D-Providence and Rep. Susan Donovan, D-Bristol, would remove hiring practices that depress wages for women and people of color.</p>
<p class="p3">“Hardworking Rhode Islanders need to earn enough to pay the rent, put food on the table and provide the stability and security that a family needs to thrive,” read the R.I. Fight for $15 and Fair Pay Bill Introduction and Kickoff <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/143757739670882/">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">Rhode Island’s minimum wage is currently $10.10 per hour, which puts the state almost $3 above the Federal Minimum Wage of $7.25 an hour. The state’s minimum wage was last changed in 2017, when the General Assembly approved a <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180130/push-for-15-an-hour-minimum-wage-renewed-by-ris-progressive-democrats">measure</a> that increased the minimum wage from $9.60 to $10.10 beginning Jan. 1, 2018 and then to $10.50 per hour beginning Jan. 1, 2019.</p>
<p class="p3">Pay in Rhode Island is not as high, on average, for workers who identify as female than for those who identify as male, according to a 2017 study by the nonpartisan National Partnership for Women and Families. The median annual pay for a woman who holds a full-time, year-round job is $44,050, while that of a man is $51,368. This difference means that women are paid 86 cents for every dollar paid to men. Further, black women in Rhode Island are paid 58 cents and Hispanic women are paid 51 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men, the study <a href="http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/workplace-fairness/fair-pay/4-2017-ri-wage-gap.pdf">reported</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">Supporters of the bills include the Center for Justice, Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Economic Progress Institute, Jobs with Justice and Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Report of Rhode Island State Police looks toward the future</b></p>
<p class="p3">State Police Superintendent Ann Assumpico outlined measures to recruit and retain women and people of color in the police force, as recommended by the results of an outside assessment of the state’s law enforcement agency.</p>
<p class="p3">The assessment details steps to increase representation that are centered on recruiting, the promotion process and administrative actions, stated the Focused Assessment of the R.I. State Police, issued to Assumpico in December 2017. The recommendations came after a review of General Orders, interviews with relevant personnel and an anonymous employee survey on existing promotion and disciplinary processes.</p>
<p class="p3">Assumpico, the first woman in charge of the state’s law enforcement agency, was sworn in after the State Police’s 2016 class provoked “a general sense of disappointment given the underwhelming graduation rate of women and persons of color in the new class,” the assessment stated. Assumpico has also experienced difficulties retaining minority and women recruits, she said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180130/ri-state-police-report-focuses-on-ways-to-recruit-more-women-minorities">This year</a>, 44 percent of the 1,403 applicants for the training academy were minorities or women compared to 35 percent in last recruitment drive in 2014.</p>
<p class="p3">The report comes as Republican gubernatorial candidate Allan Fung criticized Governor Gina Raimondo for “taking her eye off the ball” when it comes to crime, as detailed in a 15-second <a href="http://wpri.com/2018/01/30/fung-raimondo-campaigns-tangle-over-crime/">web video</a> released Monday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Three Providence community activists were inducted into the 15th Annual Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Hall of Fame at a ceremony held at City Hall Wednesday evening. The event honored the late Philip Addison Jr., Pilar McCloud and Mary Jones for upholding King’s legacy. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The ceremony stressed unity and community spirit, beginning with a speech by Mayor Jorge Elorza. He emphasized the impact that King’s lifelong work had on him as a young teenager struggling to find his way. Elorza said that the Talent Development Program at the University of Rhode Island, which was created to honor King after his assassination, provided him with a chance as a “skinny 18-year-old who didn’t have his head on straight.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The community members being honored at the ceremony “embody Dr. King’s legacy,” Elorza said, including King’s belief in “the beloved community.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A note of appreciation was then given by Council President David Salvatore, followed by a message of peace and hope by Reverend Chontell Washington. Before the three inductees were honored, actor Joe Wilson Jr. recited one of King’s speeches.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The ceremony first honored Addison — the first black member of Providence City Council who served from 1969 to 1981. He was a Freemason, a leader of the Mount Hope Neighborhood Association and “helped thousands of youth in the City of Providence,” Salvatore said. Addison’s wife, who accepted the award on his behalf, described him as a “people person” who never considered anyone “beneath … or above him.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">McCloud, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People at Providence Youth Works chairwoman, was the next to be inducted. She “dedicated her life to social justice,” Salvatore said. “King is a civil rights icon that I look up to,” McCloud said. “Civil rights and social justice don’t take a nap.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">McCloud centers “the voices of young people in her work, and that’s what we value,” said Chanda Womack, founding executive director of the Alliance of Rhode Island Southeast Asians for Education. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jones, one of the founders of the Smith Hill Community Corporation and a librarian at the Smith Hill Library was the last to be honored. Known as the “grandmother” of Smith Hill, she “instilled in us a thirst for knowledge,” said Jones’s daughter, Althea Graves, who accepted the award on her behalf. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Mary did a lot for Smith Hill Library. … Everyone who went into that library knows who she is,” said Diane Tina Jones, a friend of the awardee.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Six months after the installation of Rhode Island’s first anti-overdose drug dispenser, around 50 additional NaloxBoxes have been installed in different municipalities and cities in the state, said Claudia Rebola, NaloxBox designer and former RISD professor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The boxes, which distribute Naloxone, are meant to facilitate overdose rescues and reshape the dialogue surrounding the opioid crisis, said Dr. Geoffrey Capraro, pediatric emergency medicine sub-specialist and one of the NaloxBox’s creators.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The state saw 326 deaths from opioid overdoses in 2016, but the rate of opioid deaths in the state is slowing, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html">according to a study conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The epidemic is just raging out of control, and the antidote is completely life-saving,” Capraro said. “People (need to) recognize that a rescue is very easy to do and that anybody can do it. They could reverse the overdose before 911 services arrive.” Capraro likened Naloxone to other emergency response equipment, such as fire extinguishers or defibrillators. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Rhode Island Department of Health initially funded the project with two mini-grants of around $5,000, said Joseph Wendelken, a public information officer at the Rhode Island Department of Health. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“With Naloxone available and the education that goes with it, we can get people into treatment sooner rather than later — and the more general awareness there is, the more likely there’s resources to combat the problem,” said Eileen Hayes, president and CEO of Amos House, a social-service agency where the first box was installed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Organizations such as Amos House and the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless helped identify high-risk locations and communities for the boxes to be placed. Public spaces with large masses of people, community centers and locations with high-risk populations are the primary targets of installation, Hayes said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Naloxone can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose, it traditionally could only be administered by first responders in case of an emergency or obtained with a prescription, Capraro said. The placement of the Naloxone drug in a publicly-accessible box aims to respond to an overdose by equipping<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>bystanders with the tools to save a life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The project began in fall 2017 when Capraro connected with RISD Associate Professor Soojung Ham, who worked with two RISD students on an independent study of the NaloxBox. By February,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rebola took lead of the project and worked to reduce the cost of the prototype.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(We look to) design a friendly, approachable product that doesn’t intimidate bystanders and empowers them,” she said, adding that the front door of the box is transparent so that passersby can easily see the contents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, the cost of each box — not including the Naloxone drug itself — is estimated to be around $200, Capraro said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are two versions of the NaloxBox: the “NaloxBox Classic,” which is the standard box, and the “NaloxBox Text,” which has all the features of the classic but also sends text message alerts to personnel when the boxes are opened, according to Rebola. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The boxes use two forms of Naloxone: the intramuscular formulation, which is injected, and the intranasal formulation, which is sprayed into a nostril. The injectable units require trained personnel, but are less costly than the sprayable units, Capraro said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These injectable units are placed in locations such as libraries, soup kitchens and homeless centers where people can be trained to administer the drug. Training typically takes 15 to 20 minutes and covers different aspects of detecting and responding to an overdose.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Capraro hopes that NaloxBoxes spread to other states, but warns that others will have to understand the “regulatory framework” of Naloxone to adopt this solution, given that Naloxone is regulated differently state by state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rebola is currently introducing the NaloxBox to Cincinnati through a grant provided by the University of Cincinnati, where she now teaches. In Ohio, there were over 4,300 deaths from opioid overdoses in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Capraro and Rebola are still constructing the boxes, but Amos House will start assembling boxes to keep up with the demand, Hayes said. The Brown Opioid Academic Interest Group may also become involved with the project by having some members become trainers of Naloxone administration. The group also may work in conjunction with the Preventing Overdose and Naloxone Intervention program, as discussed in a recent conversation between the group and Capraro.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We want people to know that even though drug addiction is a very difficult condition, people do recover successfully,” Capraro said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following nine months of discussion, Care New England and Partners HealthCare announced a definitive agreement to merge Jan 25. The agreement raises questions about the state of Rhode Island’s health care system and Brown’s relationship to it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Right now what we’re focusing on is helping people understand the issues,” said President Paxson P’19 in response to the merger. “They are complicated. There’s a lot of uncertainty.” Brown previously announced an alternative merger proposal with CNE and Prospect Medical Holdings, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/12/u-proposes-merger-care-new-england-health-system/">The Herald previously reported.</a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">With the CNE-Partners merger, Partners has the opportunity to weaken CNE connections to the Warren Alpert Medical School and reduce resources for research, said Ira Wilson, professor of health services. Partners could also move super specialities, like rare infant care or high-risk cancer treatments, out of state. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In the worst scenario, all those things happen,” Wilson said. “We really have no idea what Partners’ intentions are.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is a possibility that Partners could invigorate Rhode Island’s health care system and economy by saving CNE from financial collapse, Wilson conceded. But Partners’ unwillingness to speak to the University suggests otherwise, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With Partners’ large-scale presence in Massachusetts, the company is able to set high prices, according to Wilson. If they become a bigger part of the Rhode Island market, Partners can impose the same costs on Rhode Island residents. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The larger (Partners) gets, the more market power it gets, the more advantageous, i.e. higher prices it can negotiate,” Paxson said, adding that lower reimbursement rates in Rhode Island might cause Partners to bring speciality care to Massachusetts, where rates are much higher. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has taken to Twitter to express his concern over Partners’ involvement in R.I.. On Jan. 22, Whitehouse tweeted, “When we lost bank headquarters, R.I. economy took a big hit, downtown (Providence) emptied. In health care, there’s even more need for local control. Hard to move as a state if hospital CEOs heed only out-of-state corporate HQs. However this turns out, local control should be a priority.”</span></p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although inquires into a merger between CNE and Partners have caused a media buzz this month, Paxson and others say health care experts have been worried about this state of affairs for a while.</span></p>
<p class="p2">CNE and Partners have worked together for years, according to the joint statement the two health care organizations released last week. “Care New England has maintained a close working relationship with Partners HealthCare since 2009 through a clinical affiliation with Brigham and Women’s Hospital,” the statement said, also mentioning “a long-standing collaborative and collegial relationship between McLean Hospital (a Partners hospital) and Care New England’s Butler Hospital.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Andrew Cohen, nephrologist and professor of medicine at the Med School, agrees that the consolidation has been a long time coming. Although opposed to the Partners merger with CNE, Cohen recently vocalized his discontent with the “Brown Proposal" — the University’s own proposition with the California-based Prospect Medical Holdings to merge with CNE.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“My concern about the Brown proposal is that it’s a day late and a dollar short,” Cohen told The Herald. Cohen, who spent a lot of his career at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, is familiar with and advocates for a unified health care system, which would allow for patient information to be available to all the doctors in the system. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stanford, Harvard and Partners (which includes Brigham and Women’s and Mass General Hospitals), as well as Tufts and many other major healthcare organizations across the country have these unified systems, called “single physician group practices.” However, in Rhode Island, physicians are a part of many different health care groups. For example, doctors within Rhode Island Hospital belong to different companies and practices.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> As a kidney specialist who sees patients that often have complicated medical histories, Cohen said it’s been“almost impossible to get all the information I need,” which includes basic information like a patient’s prescriptions. Brown Physicians Inc. is attempting to bring together some of these smaller groups into one group, but it still leaves many entities out, Cohen said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cohen expressed concern about a lack of consolidation and “the growing presence of (the) Partners system in Rhode Island” in a 2009 letter to Edward Wing, then dean of the Med School,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Timothy Babineau, current CEO of Lifespan, the state’s largest health care provider. “We got no reply from either party,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Only in the last few years has anyone seriously considered making changes, Cohen said. Resistance to consolidation has come from many parties, including larger specialties and Lifespan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m not saying this purely out of speculation: Lifespan has a stake in keeping things as they are,” Cohen said, adding that monetary incentives and a desire to keep control have prevented change. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With Partners becoming a player in the state, “it makes it much harder for the state to maintain control of its own destiny with respect to what kind of health care system it has,” Paxson said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As to the effect the merger will have on Rhode Island and the Med School, Cohen is not sure. “CNE makes up a minority of teaching faculty,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cohen hopes that the CNE-Partners merger “may compel Lifespan and other groups to come to the table” to find a solution that will benefit the state as well as the hospitals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Paxson welcomes the idea of further discussion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I would love to have other groups engage in the conversation,” including Lifespan, she said. “Partners coming into the state, there’s a risk to Lifespan … It’s been a little bit surprising that Lifespan hasn’t been more concerned about the impact of Care New England’s decision on its ability to continue to be a thriving academic health care system.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University tried to talk with Lifespan about potential mergers, “but they weren’t interested at the time,” Paxson said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lifespan remains open to discussion moving forward, Babineau wrote in an email to The Herald, acknowledging that the merger could have a large effect on Rhode Island’s health care system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both Paxson and Wilson warn that the CNE-Partners deal is not guaranteed to happen just yet. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s still a chance this could flounder because of regulatory issues,” Wilson said. “This purchase still has to go through the Rhode Island Department of Health.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Antitrust issues within Massachusetts have slowed Partners’ growth there, but similar regulatory problems in Rhode Island have yet to be tested.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Rhode Island is a really special state because it’s small enough that we can do things that are innovative and interesting,” Paxson said, adding that she’d like to see the people of Rhode Island come together to make an affordable health care system that has both a strong academic medical backbone and strong primary care.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Elorza reiterates call to lease Providence Water Supply Board</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Mayor Jorge Elorza is continuing to press for the leasing of the Providence Water Supply Board to fund the city’s $1 billion long-term pension liabilities.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza reiterated his commitment to lease the Water Supply Board following his <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180118/providence-mayor-jorge-elorza-sets-sights-on-second-term">announcement</a> that he is running for re-election in an interview with the Providence Journal Jan. 18.</p>
<p class="p4">The mayor’s team expressed satisfaction with their management of the city’s budget throughout his time in office. “I can confirm that the city realized a $2.2 million rainy-day fund,” wrote Victor Morente, press secretary for the office of the mayor. This surplus in the general reserve eliminated a cumulative deficit of $3.16 million, according to the City of Providence Financial Report for fiscal year 2017.</p>
<p class="p4">A surplus was projected for $10.2 million, but <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171004/providence-to-show-102m-surplus-for-fiscal-year-says-mayor">Elorza told the Providence Journal</a> that when a $7.2 million surplus was achieved, $4.9 million was paid to a <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180118/providence-mayor-jorge-elorza-sets-sights-on-second-term">settlement</a> with city firefighters.</p>
<p class="p4">The recent surplus is attributable to “realistic budgeting, continued strategic cash management, more efficient and robust tax collections, better departmental revenues and attrition savings in salary expenditures,” Morente wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">Despite the general fund surplus, Providence’s budget has long-standing challenges — most notably, pension liabilities. In 2016, the National Resource Network, a federal program which advises cities on how to strengthen their economies, recommended that the city of Providence sell or lease a valuable asset to fund this shortfall. The Water Supply Board, which provides water to 600,000 people across Rhode Island, was valued at $404.2 million in 2017.</p>
<p class="p4">While Elorza is in favor of leasing the Water Supply Board, he has been consistently opposed to privatization. In order for Providence to lease it, legislation must first be passed by the Rhode Island General Assembly because a state statute currently prohibits the city from profiting off its water supply.</p>
<p class="p4">Legislation to create a regional water board with the authority to lease and sell property was introduced in April 2017 to the Assembly by Rep. Scott Slater D-Providence, but was opposed by House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello D-Cranston, on the grounds that the regionalization would not be beneficial to ratepayers. The Rhode Island Republican Party critiqued the bill as being designed to bail out Providence with state residents’ water bills.</p>
<p class="p4">As Elorza looks toward re-election and the possibility of a second term, he continues to advocate for monetizing the city’s water supply as the most viable solution to the city’s pension debt. “While the City continues to pursue all options to put Providence on a strong fiscal path moving forward and resolve the long-term pension liabilities for future generations, at this time we believe that monetization of our water system is a viable and sustainable solution,” Morente wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">“Providence Water is committed to providing high quality, safe and affordable water to two-thirds of Rhode Island. We will provide support to city and state officials as they analyze the issue of monetizing Providence Water,” wrote Dyana Koelsch, spokesperson for the Water Supply Board, in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">“This year, we will again be pursuing this at the State House and be submitting legislation that outlines a path forward. We are confident that any transaction will ensure continued access to high quality water at affordable rates,” Morente wrote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Music Modernization Act, a recently introduced piece of legislation under consideration by Congress, aims to revamp the musical licensing system, according to the bill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of three recently proposed bills intended to regulate the music industry, the act focuses on songwriters and the royalties they receive when their music is recorded and reproduced (otherwise known as “mechanicals”). </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If the act is passed, it would be a win for songwriters and their publishing companies, but may adversely affect streaming companies, Associate Professor of Music Marc Perlman wrote in an email to The Herald, adding that streaming companies may be economically strained or even put out of business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We can be sure they will lobby hard against this bill,” he wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Island Senator and co-sponsor of the Music Modernization Act Sheldon Whitehouse is hopeful that this act can improve the market for artists and possibly help the state of Rhode Island in particular.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“As more of us stream our music online, this bill will help make sure the songwriters who compose the music we love are paid fair value for their work,” Whitehouse said, according to a statement from his office. “Updating our licensing and royalties laws is a win for creators, publishers and fans of great music.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the bill’s own words, the Music Modernization Act is meant “to provide clarity with respect to, and to modernize, the licensing system for musical works … to ensure fairness in the establishment of certain rates and fees.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The act hopes to address the failure of the free market to effectively regulate music prices. Every time a computer streams music, it copies the audio into RAM, which is a form of reproduction, Perlman wrote. Though the free market is expected to create a price that matches the demand for the product, the inexpensive nature of streaming music means that artists are frequently underpaid. On average, artists receive $0.006 to $0.0084<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>per stream for songs on Spotify, according to <a href="http://time.com/3590670/spotify-calculator/">Time Magazine</a>. With these numbers, 100,000 streams would result in a payout ranging from $600 to $840.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Figuring out how much music is worth is a contentious business,” Perlman wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The act would enlist the Copyright Royalty Board to “mimic” the free market process by setting prices for payouts to artists, though exact procedures are yet to be determined, Perlman wrote. The CRB had previously tried to regulate rates for broadcasting on the internet, but Congress reversed the decision due to webcasters’ complaints that the costs were too high.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While webcasters have fought against high prices for broadcasting, songwriters, performers and producers have voiced concerns that they are not getting a fair payout for their services. Jay-Z went so far as to create his own streaming service, “Tidal,” to combat the problem. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2017/09/13/jay-zs-joke-of-a-music-service-tidal-is-actually-doing-really-well/#21c188905c92">Forbes</a>, the rapper’s app is one of the top grossing on iTunes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Alongside artists like Jay-Z, students on campus are affected by issues of music streaming regulation. Colin MacFaddin ’21 has been composing his own music since he was in the ninth grade. MacFaddin uses streaming apps notorious for low payouts, including Spotify and SoundCloud. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I haven’t monetized either (account) because I personally believe my music wouldn’t be worth monetizing,” MacFaddin said. “I don’t think it would have enough views for it to actually have a payout.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is hard to compete with other artists and actually make money on these music platforms, MacFaddin said. Right now, he uses the platforms to share both his covers and original songs with friends.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This is the second attempt at passing the bill, which was introduced in the House in 2017. This act has been referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the additional pieces of legislation introduced in Congress is the Fair Play, Fair Pay Act, which seeks to compensate music performers as opposed to songwriters. This act is focused on “performance royalties,” or the payouts artists receive when broadcasters play their music on the radio. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>NAACP, community unite in response to racist flyers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Providence chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called a press conference Monday at 12:30 p.m. at the intersection of Brook and George streets. Around 100 people gathered for a period of 20 minutes to show community solidarity in response to the discovery of racist and violent printed matter found around the University and many local areas, including Hope Street and Pawtucket. The paraphernalia included pink flyers captioned “Negro Crime in Mayor Jorge O. Elorza’s Sanctuary City” and booklets that displayed disparaging captions alongside photos of black Providence residents, including Jim Vincent, president of the Providence NAACP, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180205/providence-mayor-to-anonymous-authors-of-racist-fliers-you-dont-belong-in-our-community">the Providence Journal reported.</a> The person or group who distributed the flyers remains unknown, according to the Providence Journal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The press conference was attended by Mayor Jorge Elorza, other local politicians and community leaders, including Ward 3 City Councilwoman Nirva LaFortune, who recited Maya Angelou’s poem, “Still I Rise.” Elorza called the flyers’ message “deeply disturbing,” and further stated that “there is no room for this type of disgusting bigotry in our city.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ellen Cola ’20, who helped organize the demonstration, said she was appalled by the “blatant racism and anti-blackness” that the posters were proliferating. “Racism is so persistent in this (Providence) community,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pilar McCloud, youth council chair and assistant secretary of the Providence chapter of the NAACP, agreed that racism is very much at large in the United States. “We have a president of the United States who’s made it very comfortable for people to feel like they can say and do whatever they want — especially when it comes (to addressing) people from other countries, black and brown people,” she said. “If anybody said that racism didn’t exist anymore, they’re lying. The closet racist is long gone. That’s why it puts the city of Providence at risk.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Providence chapter of the NAACP has encountered denigrating remarks and threats before through social media, emails and letters, but the appearance of the flyers signals a larger menace, McCloud said. “These people have targeted specific people of the community — and definitely people of color.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The incident was met with an urgent response, as the press conference and demonstration were organized within 48 hours of when the flyers were found, Cola said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“What made the rally really powerful was that we had the ability to galvanize ourselves together in a really short amount of time,” McCloud said. She added that the presence of a large number of youth, including many students from the University, was encouraging. “We need young energy and youth to keep us motivated,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The demonstration served the purpose of “sending a message to (the perpetrators) that what they are doing is not okay,” Cola said, adding that demonstrators aimed to show a message of unity and collectivity. “There will be consequences,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(The people who did this) want (us) to be afraid,” McCloud said. “They want (us) to run and hide. They presumably want (us) to stop what (we’re) doing.” But McCloud asserted the importance of not giving in to racist sentiments. “We are not going to let anyone or any group of racist individuals keep us from doing what we’re here to do,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">McCloud spoke of the importance of taking up a more active role in response to acts of intolerance. “Get involved. Be a voice. Be heard. Stand up for what you believe in. Or more importantly, stand up, because you never know when you’re going to need somebody to stand up for you.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wastewater plant to turn sludge into renewable energy</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/06/wastewater-plant-turn-sludge-renewable-energy/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Wastewater treatment plants certainly have enough sludge, but they’re in need of an essential commodity: energy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Narragansett Bay Commission, operator of two wastewater treatment plants in Rhode Island, decided to turn their “sludge,” or the byproduct of wastewater treatment, into energy, said Jamie Samons, public affairs manager of the Bay Commission. Within the month, a biogas generation facility will begin to convert waste into power, she said. This step comes two years after the Bay Commission set a goal to be 100 percent renewable by 2020, following net metering laws that allowed organizations to receive renewable energy credits for green energy produced off-site.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wastewater treatment plants can be “one of the most energy-intensive facilities in a given city,” Samons said. It’s estimated that moving dirty water accounts for 1 percent of the nation’s energy, according to Curt Spalding, former Environmental Protection Agency administrator for New England. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One way to alleviate the carbon footprint associated with wastewater treatment plants is to take the methane produced by sludge, which was previously released or used as heat, and <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180125/ri-green-energy-power-of-sludge">turn it into fuel</a> for the plant itself. Sludge creates methane when heated in an oxygen-free environment, Spalding said, and the methane is scrubbed of any toxins and then burned to create energy for the plant. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At Bucklin Point, the smaller of the Bay Commission’s two plants, an $8.2 million implementation of the biogas generation facility will provide one quarter of the energy the plant needs to function, Samons said. The other treatment plant does not yet have the technology necessary to capture the potential energy of biogas.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There is a need for very, very rapid deployment of renewables into the grid to solve the climate problem, or to help slow down the climate problem,” said Stephen Porder, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. “In some ways, it’s easier for one organization to decide to buy a whole bunch of solar panels than it is for millions of individuals to band together to do the same thing. …We have very, very little time left.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Besides the environmental benefits of turning sludge into energy, the Bay Commission itself will eventually save money on energy expenses. Currently, it spends $12 to $15 million a year on electricity — a cost that will drop to practically nothing once capital costs are paid, Samons said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Electrical prices can be incredibly volatile,” he added. “The fact that we’re creating our own energy lets us have greater stability in what we expend for energy because the expenditure is wrapped up in those capital costs.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the University, the Transition to Renewable Sources of Energy committee is exploring investments in renewable infrastructure, mirroring the Bay Commission’s renewable energy initiative, Porder said. After meeting throughout the fall, the energy committee plans to put out a call for developers to propose renewable projects that the University could implement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The administration is very supportive of the idea and really wants to do their utmost to do what is both economically good and environmentally good,” Porder said, adding that the committee hopes to sign up for purchasing renewable-generated electrictiy in the next six months.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University’s carbon footprint will drop because of the Bay Commission’s commitment to diversifying energy sources, Spalding said. “The fact is, every time someone flushes a toilet at Brown, it goes to (the Bay Commission’s) facility,” Spalding said. “It’s fortunate that the Bay Commission decided to be a leader and reduce their emissions.”</span></p>
<p class="p4">The Bay Commission’s commitment to renewable energy extends beyond their conversion of sludge. After investing in three wind turbines in 2012, which directly produced 40 percent of the power needed for the Fields Point facility, the agency decided to invest in the construction of three more wind turbines off-site. Two five-megawatt solar facilities will also go online this year, completing the 100 percent renewable energy mosaic pieced together by the Bay Commission. Once complete, the agency will be powered by over 50 percent wind, 8 percent biogas and 30 to 35 percent solar, she added.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even after the renewable energy initiatives are completed, wastewater treatment plants may still be able to reduce wasted energy and emissions even further, Spalding said. Currently, after the sludge is processed, it is incinerated in Woonsocket, releasing emissions like mercury into the air. The Bay Commission may be able to prevent this discharge by “pelletizing” the sludge and selling it as a low-nitrogen fertilizer instead of burning it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There’s better ways to manage sludge than burn it,” Spalding said. “That, I think, is their next big challenge. They’ve done a great job looking at the energy they’re using.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Elorza, teachers union clash at City Hall</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Yesterday, in the Council Chambers of City Hall, Mayor Jorge Elorza was scheduled to begin his annual State of the City address at 6 p.m. But by 6 p.m., Elorza still had not made his entrance — and the staircases above and below the third-floor chambers were jam-packed. People chatted and chanted intermittently. Signs were written in English and Spanish, in bright colors and stark black marker. Some of the messages were personal: “Elorza … you were EDUCATED by PVD schools … Don’t throw us under the BUS!” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hundreds of teachers picketed the address.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re here to let the mayor know that what he has given us in negotiation terms is not fair,” Rachel Greenberg, a teacher at Asa Messer Elementary School, told The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ken Drake of Esek Hopkins Middle School told The Herald that the proposed three-year contract does not include a pay raise other than a 0.5 percent hike in the final year of the agreement.“That’s not a raise, that’s a joke,” he said. The mayor’s presence on a charter school board constitutes a “conflict of interest,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elorza’s speech started over 20 minutes late as a result of the picketing. Despite being booed as he entered the chamber, Elorza began his speech with a doggedly positive portrayal of Providence as a city that has exemplified a “show of unity” in welcoming refugees, deliberately broadcasting a political message that is contrary to President Trump’s position on the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“For the past three years, we’ve been continually reminded of the power of the people,” Elorza said, as the chants of “shame on you” continued to reverberate throughout the chambers from outside.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elorza addressed the issue of education early on in his speech. He described his initiatives as always crafted in response to the voices of the city. “We asked the public, ‘What is missing from our schools?’” Elorza said. “We heard that our students and teachers want facilities that support 21st century learning.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elorza referenced his pledge in August 2017 to dedicate $400 million over the span of 10 years to school “facilities … because our students and teachers demand it and, frankly, because they deserve it,” he said. “While classrooms themselves are important, so are the tools we give our students to learn with.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Prior to the address, Providence Teachers Union President Maribeth Calabro gave an impassioned speech of her own to the crowd of protestors.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“On January 3, our mayor<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>boasted a $5.4 million surplus for the city of Providence. Sixteen days later, he sent one of his negotiators to the table to say ‘sorry for ya, we don’t have any money for teachers,’” Calabro said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The crowd clamored with displeasure.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “Teachers touch more lives than mayors,” called one voice from the crowd.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Absolutely. Actually, teachers impact more lives than anybody. We make mayors,” Calabro responded.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Calabro explicitly recognized how Rep. John Lombardi, D-Pawtucket, Sen. Maryellen Goodwin, D-Providence and Sen. Dominick Ruggerio, D-Providence “would not cross the picket line” in solidarity with teachers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A fair deal would mean “consistency,” Greenberg told The Herald. Elorza “has given us a variety of different people who are on the team to negotiate, but we have come with one team every time,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “I find it to be kind of double-speak, and I find it to be insulting. … In order for us to be able to move forward, the mayor needs to be honest with himself and his representation of the city’s finances,” Calabro told The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a press conference following the address, Elorza spoke of an “opportunity for a transformational contract” and emphasized his commitment to “our kids and our schools.” He said that teachers were given a raise eight months ago, and that “when you look at the long-term city’s finances, we simply don’t have the money” for another raise. “We have a surplus in the city, we have a rainy day fund; all of that is going to evaporate in a heartbeat unless we watch our costs going forward,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Elorza characterized the picketing as “democracy in action” and said he is open to conversation and continued negotiation, though nothing has been scheduled yet.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m hoping for a phone call that says, ‘Let’s get back to the table and start conversations again,’” Calabro told The Herald. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Committee on Oversight reviews lawsuits about insurance, food stamps</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/09/committee-oversight-reviews-lawsuits-insurance-food-stamps/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Over a year after the faulty implementation of the United Health Infrastructure Project, the R.I. House Committee on Oversight is still finding a way forward. During a hearing Thursday night at the State House, the committee discussed the consolidated computer system that processes and distributes social services. Starting in 2016, the project obstructed many Rhode Island residents from receiving their benefits and resulted in two lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island against the Executive Office of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p class="p4">On Jan. 29, the state agreed to return benefits to any clients or customers who, as a result of UHIP, stopped receiving money to pay for their health insurance from the Medicare Premium Program, said Ellen Saideman, the ACLU lawyer who filed the suit against the executive office on Jan. 2, 2018. The computer glitch responsible for the neglected patients occurred in January 2017, less than a year after Deloitte Consulting LLP, hired by the state, implemented UHIP. Despite the state’s compliance, Saideman wants to ensure that the state tracks down everyone whose benefits were canceled, not just those with whom she is in contact.</p>
<p class="p4">“(The state) submitted the name of my client and some others on Jan. 29 to get their benefits back,” Saideman said. “Whether this is everyone, I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="p4">“I can ensure the committee that we are doing everything we can to determine the full universe of people and get their benefits reinstated as quickly as possible,” said Eric Beane, state health and human services secretary.</p>
<p class="p4">The discussion highlighted another case against the state focused on holding the executive office accountable. As agreed upon by a <a href="http://wpri.com/2016/12/08/aclu-plans-to-sue-state-over-uhip-issues/">lawsuit</a> filed in December 2016 and settled shortly after, the state must provide monthly data to the ACLU about the processing of food stamp applications. In addition, the state must achieve a 96 percent “timeliness rate” for processing those applications, which is defined as reviewing data to determine eligibility within seven to 30 days, said Lynette Labinger, another ACLU lawyer present at the State House Thursday.</p>
<p class="p4">“They haven’t come close to 96 percent,” Labinger said, adding that the timeliness rate was 59.8 percent for expedited applications and 64.9 percent for non-expedited applications in August 2017. The state has made progress recently, reporting an 83.9 percent timeliness rate in December 2017, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">The executive office also failed to provide the ACLU with data about timeliness rates for the month of September, despite their court order to do so, Labinger said. This was due to “lack of confidence” in the data because of a system failure from UHIP, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“Real people … are not getting food stamps who really, really need them,” Labinger said.</p>
<p class="p4">Courtney Hawkins, director of the state’s department of human services, cannot predict if and when UHIP will begin to save the state money, which was one of the program’s original purposes, she said. Current efforts are focused on restoring benefits to those who need them, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">The contract with Deloitte is set to end in late June, but they will likely continue to work with the state in order to address any continuous problems with the program, Beane said — a statement met with audible frustration from the committee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Providence Safe Stations Program, which opened the city’s 12 fire stations to those battling opioid addiction, treated its second person suffering from addiction Monday, less than two months after its inception, said Acting Emergency Medical Services Chief Captain Zachariah Kenyon, who spearheaded the program. As the program gains publicity, each firehouse is expected to receive over four people a day as the city continues to respond to around 40 overdose-related incidents per week, Kenyon said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> This firehouse-based model is meant to discreetly and efficiently provide 24-7 aid to those affected by opioid addiction, Kenyon said. He initially came across the idea for the safe stations through a post on social media in September that featured a model program in Manchester and Nashua, New Hampshire. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When people have addiction problems and they finally reach that small window of opportunity where they want to ask for help, a lot of times they don’t know where to go for help,” Kenyon said. “We are here … to give you that opportunity to know where to go to start your recovery process.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The program aims to give people access to help before they are in crisis, said Director of Recovery Services at the Providence Center for Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Services Deb Dettor. The fire stations worked closely with the Rhode Island Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals, the Providence Center and the Anchor Recovery Community Center to provide services to those visiting the station.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If we have another avenue where people can just walk in the door and get help on the spot, that will help a great deal,” Dettor said, adding that offering treatment in a firehouse, as opposed to a hospital, may help mitigate the stigma associated with addiction. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Most conversations surrounding the opioid epidemic focus on Narcan, the drug used to reverse an opioid overdose. But while Narcan can be lifesaving, it does not solve the epidemic at its core, Kenyon said. It is vital to offer recovery services in addition to medical help, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The epidemics of opioid use disorders and overdose deaths require an ‘all hands on deck’ approach, and the Safe Stations program provides an excellent example of how to address these challenges head-on,” said Geoff Capraro, assistant professor of emergency medicine and one of the creators of <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/02/anti-overdose-drug-made-available-to-bystanders/">NaloxBox</a>, a device that allows bystanders to administer Narcan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The recovery process begins when a person rings the doorbell of a fire station and indicates that they need help. On-site personnel then complete a Field Intake Assessment and check the individual’s vital signs, blood sugar and general condition, Kenyon said. After confirming that there is no need for emergency care, the on-site responders contact a hotline number, provided by the Providence Center and Anchor Recovery, which connects the individual with addiction recovery coaches and clinicians. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The safe stations are currently working to install signs on the outside of the building that advise people seeking help to call a dispatch number in case firefighters are out on a run, Kenyon said. The dispatcher will redirect those people to a different station or reassure them that personnel are returning to the site.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Providence Safe Stations operate as Rhode Island works to reduce instances of opioid overdoses in the state at large. In August 2015, Gov. Gina Raimondo established the Overdose Prevention and Intervention Task Force, which aims to reduce opioid overdose deaths by one-third within three years, according to Raimondo’s official <a href="http://www.governor.ri.gov/initiatives/odtaskforce/">website</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Safe Stations Program was initially planned to begin Nov. 1 but was later moved to Jan. 2 when those involved realized that they needed more time and funds, Kenyon said. Funding for the stations comes from state and federal grants, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If we can get to one person and change their life, we’ve done something different that helps somebody,” Kenyon said. “If I can get one life corrected and changed to better habits, then I think the program is a success.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">As of the final fiscal quarter of FY ’17 the difference in campaign funds between Providence Democratic mayoral candidates Mayor Jorge Elorza and Kobi Dennis is over half a million dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Challenger Dennis raised $18,690 and has $2,641.33 remaining after expenses, while Elorza raised $698,449.96, with $664,229.67 after expenses and liabilities. Well-represented among Elorza’s donors are employees of local law firms; about 12 of his contributions for the last fiscal quarter have come from employees of Locke Lord LLP alone. Elorza has more than 10 individual donations of $1,000 dollars, which is the most an individual or political action committee can contribute to a candidate in a calendar year. Dennis, one the other hand, has received three one-time donations of $1,000 in the same time period.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dennis, a community activist who worked on Elorza’s first campaign, said this difference “doesn’t worry (him) at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I have yet to reach out to any PACs. I have yet to reach out to any unions, because I literally want this race — my portion of the race — to be about the people,” Dennis said. His campaign fundraising is structured around smaller grassroots events tailored to families and youth instead of high-budget campaign events, he added. “All these huge, elaborate campaign fundraisers, all this money in the bank — and what is that doing for the person that doesn’t even have money to pay their rent? What is that doing for the young person that is struggling with college bills?” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dennis, as reported in a</span><span class="s3"> previous Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/26/two-candidates-make-bids-mayoral-race/">article</a>, sometimes frequents nightclubs to campaign, given his interest in reaching out to the 18- to 24-year-old demographic, he said. He stressed the importance of being proactive in convincing youth to engage with politics. “Night clubs, basketball games, arcades, skating rinks — I go everywhere,” he said. So far, he is pleased with having registered “dozens” of voters, including several first-time voters, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many “politicians spend a disproportionate amount of their time raising money, and they end up talking to a very narrow segment of society trying to raise that money — and so they hear about certain concerns of the donor class that might not be the concerns of wider society,” said John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, an organization that advocates “to limit the role of money in politics.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dennis said that rather than the “physical” amount of money a candidate has raised, the “perception of money” plays an important role in Providence politics. Money gives an impression of political legitimacy, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I don’t think that not having enough money can ever make a candidate not legitimate,” said Rose Lang-Maso, membership director of the Brown Democrats.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In terms of money for the day-to-day operations of the campaign, Dennis said that “according to the statistics, you would need at least $100 to $200,000 to be a formidable opponent in a mayoral race for a city of our size.” Dennis’ goal is to raise $100,000 to $150,000, first and foremost to just “cover the costs” of the campaign, he said. He has yet to secure campaign headquarters and a campaign manager, Dennis added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “Money is necessary to run an effective political campaign where the candidate can get their message out,” Marion said, emphasizing the importance of sufficient funding for advertising for a campaign.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Dennis remains undeterred. “I want to get those voters that have never been interested in the process, that have never been interested in politics,” Dennis said. “So I’m going about it the old-fashioned way; I believe in the Democratic process. I’m going to trust it. I’m going to trust that every vote counts.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bill allows consent education in R.I. schools</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Rhode Island House Committee on Health, Education and Welfare unanimously passed House Bill 7044, which allows consent to be included in sex education curricula in secondary schools, Wednesday night. Rep. Joseph Solomon, D-22, introduced the bill in early January, inspired by recent media coverage surrounding sexual assault.</p>
<p class="p2">Sponsored by five Democratic state representatives, the bill passed in a committee of 13 Democrats and two Republicans, garnering bipartisan support, Solomon said. “Preventing (sexual assault) from happening, that’s something everybody can be on board with,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Current rhetoric surrounding sexual assault was only one of the incentives behind the bill; Solomon himself never received education on consent while in secondary school, which he felt, retrospectively, was a significant problem, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">“I felt that a person shouldn’t learn about consent education when they get to college,” he said. “That’s something that they should learn before they go.”</p>
<p class="p2">Kassandra Fotiadis ’18, lead peer educator for Sexual Assault Peer Education, sees consent education in secondary schools as a primary step in preventing sexual violence. “Tendencies for violent behavior start before (college),” she said. Fotiadis’ only contention with the bill is that it only allows for consent education, as opposed to making it obligatory. That said, mandating consent education if the lessons are unwanted goes against the practices SAPE teaches, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">“I guess the full accomplishment, for me, would be for K-12 schools to do something related to consent education,” Fotiadis said. “But what that education looks like should depend on the school and the student culture.”</p>
<p class="p2">Though the R.I. Department of Education does not prevent sex education programs from teaching consent, “from what I hear from people, it’s not being taught at the level where it should be,” Solomon said.</p>
<p class="p2">Michaela Kennedy-Cuomo ’20, campus organizer for the University’s chapter of It’s On Us, a sexual assault awareness and support group, believes the bill will have an extensive impact.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This bill will help kids from a younger age start to recognize what is consensual and what’s not, improve the quality of their interactions and, most importantly, prevent sexual assault, to an extent,” Kennedy-Cuomo said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She also sees the bill as especially fitting for educating high school students. She remembers a culture of non-consensuality in her own high school that she thinks may have been improved by a program that educates students on consent, Kennedy-Cuomo said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(During) high school, I think there are a lot of sexual encounters which are non-consensual which perpetrators don’t realize,” Kennedy-Cuomo said. “During high school years, many survivors also don’t realize, … ‘Wait, that is really messed up.’”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consent education would give high school students a clearer idea of the conversations they should be having, Kennedy-Cuomo said. It is important to dispel the notion that consent prevents students from talking or hooking up with each other, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Solomon hopes House Bill 7044 will be scheduled for a hearing in the House of Representatives within the next few weeks.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The number of medical marijuana dispensaries in Rhode Island could increase from three to 15, raising $5.1 million in projected revenue, according to a new budget proposal released by Gov. Gina Raimondo Jan. 18. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When it comes to medical marijuana, “we lag far behind in comparison to the rest of the country,” said Norman Birenbaum, principal policy and economic analyst for the state’s medical marijuana program. In states with legalized medical marijuana, there is an average of 1,400 patients per dispensary, but in Rhode Island, there is an average of 6,000 patients per dispensary, Birenbaum said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo’s plan for the expansion of the state’s medical marijuana program also allows people suffering from acute pain to receive recommendations from physicians that would enable them to use cannabis products. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Acute pain refers to the “normal, predicted onset of pain,” Birenbaum said. Patients could access marijuana to recover from surgery or while recovering from a car accident, for example, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Expanding the availability of medical marijuana could help prevent opioid addictions, Birenbaum said. Opioids are frequently prescribed for patients following surgeries, and can be habit forming.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Raimondo’s budget proposal overview, there were 233 opioid overdose deaths in Rhode Island in 2017. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The more we can get away from opioids, the better it is,” said Nadir Pearson ’19, founder of the Student Marijuana Alliance for Research and Transparency. “Cannabis is not physiologically addicting the same way opioids are.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Licensing more dispensaries will also help ensure greater regulation as well as safer products and purchasing, Birenbaum said. While there are over 60,000 registered home-grown plants, there are only 9,500 plants in the three dispensaries, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Medical marijuana production could then be handed over to dispensaries to “make sure patients don’t have to buy from (the) black market or grow from homes,” Birenbaum said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But some believe that Raimondo’s proposal does not go far enough in its efforts to expand the marijuana industry. According to Morgan Fox, communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project, the state is being short-sighted by refusing to legalize marijuana recreationally when other nearby states, like Massachusetts, have already done so. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The continued prohibition of recreational use “is going to rob the state of financial benefits and put a strain on law enforcement for enforcing laws against behavior that should be legal,” Fox said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though it has been legal since 2006, medical marijuana is not considered a prescription drug because the federal government still classifies cannabis as a Schedule I drug, Birenbaum said. Doctors can therefore “recommend” but not prescribe medical marijuana, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It is treated like over-the-counter medicine in Rhode Island and taxed at a 7 percent sales tax,” Birenbaum said. But prices will be lowered due to expanded competition with more dispensaries and patients will have to travel shorter distances to reach one, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The overall theme is making sure regulated medicine is more accessible,” Birenbaum said. </span></p>
<em><strong>Corrections: A previous version of this article stated that Nadir Pearson said that "Cannabis is not physiologically addicting the same way opioids are, and you won’t get physical withdrawal symptoms.” In fact, cannabis habits can produce physical withdrawal symptoms. A previous version of this article also stated that Norman Birenbaum said that "Expanding the availability of medical marijuana could help prevent opioid addictions, since opioid products are often prescribed after surgeries and are addictive after three days." In fact, there is not clear evidence that opioids are addictive after three days. The Herald regrets the errors. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Court upholds ruling against Providence Fire Department</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a 2016 ruling Jan. 25 in favor of former Providence firefighter Lori Franchina, who had originally sued the Providence Fire Department in 2012 on the grounds that her colleagues had harassed her because of her sexual orientation and gender. According to some legal experts, the case could help expand how Title VII is defined under federal law since it does not currently prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The abuse Lori Franchina suffered at the hands of the Providence Fire Department is nothing short of abhorrent,” Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson wrote in her decision. “And as this case demonstrates, employers should be cautioned that turning a blind eye to blatant discrimination does not generally fare well under anti-discrimination laws like Title VII.” Title VII of the Civil Rights Act currently prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of “race, color, religion, sex or national origin,” according to federal law. The Court also affirmed the jury’s earlier ruling to award Franchina over $500,000 in “front pay as well as emotional damages,” which include Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Franchina’s lawyer John Martin said he successfully employed the “sex-plus theory” of discrimination to prove that Franchina had suffered not only from sex discrimination in violation of Title VII, but also from discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="p4">The Franchina case indicates how sexism and gender-based stereotyping can influence the way in which discrimination based on sexual orientation is expressed, said Gary Busek, legal director of GLBTQ Advocates and Defenders.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to court testimony recounted by Thompson in her decision, Franchina, who identifies as lesbian, began experiencing harassment in 2006 upon being assigned to work with Andre Ferro, a fellow firefighter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When they first met, Ferro immediately asked her whether she liked women. Franchina did not answer. “I don’t normally like to work with women; but, you know, we like the same thing, so I think we’re going to get along,” Ferro told Franchina, according to court records. Soon after their initial meeting, Ferro rubbed his nipples and loudly proclaimed Franchina as his “lesbian lover.” He did so in front of their colleagues and during an ongoing emergency call. Though the station chief later reported the incident, which prompted Ferro’s dismissal in 2007, he was rehired by the department in 2008, according to court records. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Similarly, in 2001, while Ferro was “implicated” in a Title VII case for sexually inappropriate behavior toward colleague Julia O’Rourke, he didn’t face any long term disciplinary action and ultimately kept his job, Thompson noted.</p>
<p class="p4">Ferro was not the only individual to sexually harass Franchina, according to court records. Following Franchina’s 2006 interaction with Ferro and his pending dismissal, a pattern of harassment developed in the station against Franchina in retaliation to Ferro’s punishment, creating a “hostile work environment,” court records indicate. Many of her colleagues openly referred to her as “Frangina,” “cunt” and “bitch” in her presence, according to Franchina’s testimony.</p>
<p class="p4">In her decision, Thompson also noted that Franchina alleges that the station cook prepared food intended to make her violently sick on multiple occasions. A station white-board contained 21 insulting messages about Franchina, including: “Be careful how you talk to her, she’ll bark at you” and “Frangina leads Team Lesbo to victory.” Following Franchina’s promotion to lieutenant, a colleague approached her and said, “I will never take a … order from you,” Thompson reported. Her subordinates openly ignored or undermined her orders on emergency calls, including the need for a rescue vehicle to help treat a victim of a car crash who later died, she claimed in court documents.</p>
<p class="p4">“There were folks that showed contempt for women (in the department),” said Chief J. Curtis Varone in testimony from the hearing.</p>
<p class="p4">Lt. Danielle Masse, a firefighter who identifies as lesbian and is currently suing the department for discrimination, said in her testimony in Franchina’s case that women in the department are viewed as “less competent” and are “spoken to as if they have no authority.”</p>
<p class="p4">There is a culture that encourages firefighters to resolve issues between themselves and within the fire department, said Lt. Elliot Murphy, who has twenty years of experience on the job.</p>
<p class="p4">Even when Franchina reported her situation, the city and her supervisors — some of whom sought to downplay the issue — were less than adequate at responding to her complaints, Martin said.</p>
<p class="p4">“At the very highest levels of the fire department and the city government there were verified complaints and overwhelming proof of vicious harassment and retaliation that were completely ignored,” Martin said. No individual besides Ferro was fired or formally reprimanded, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">According to court documents, when Franchina reported to Chief Michael Crawford that a subordinate intentionally sprayed her face with “blood and brain matter” while treating a “suicide-attempt victim,” Crawford wrote in his complaint to the city’s Equal Employment Opportunity Officer that he thought that she was “blowing (the incident) out of proportion.”</p>
<p class="p4">Following Thompson’s decision supporting Franchina, more LGBTQ+ individuals will likely come forward with discrimination and harassment claims, said Gregory R. Nevins, Counsel and Employment Fairness Project director at Lambda Legal Services. “It’s rare to almost nonexistent to find a circumstance where anti-gay or lesbian harassment does not have some sort of gender-based overtone to it.”</p>
<p class="p4">Because Franchina’s case was centered on sex discrimination, Thompson did not change the circuit’s current interpretation of sexual orientation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To do so would require a separate legal process and the agreement of all 10 of the First Circuit Court of Appeals’ judges. Only the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin, has included sexual orientation in Title VII protection, Buseck said.</p>
<p class="p4">Still, Thompson’s strongly-written ruling seems to be hinting that the First Circuit Court of Appeals might be in agreement with the Seventh Circuit, Buseck said.</p>
<p class="p4">The City will not be appealing the ruling, according to Emily Crowell, director of communications for the Mayor’s Office.</p>
<p class="p4">In her court testimony, Olayinka Oredugba, the city’s sole Equal Opportunity Officer responsible for 2300 employees, said that she lacked the resources to investigate claims of discrimination to the best of her abilities.</p>
<p class="p4">“The City of Providence remains committed to maintaining a workplace that is free from harassment and discrimination,” Crowell said in an email statement to The Herald. “The City takes any complaint seriously and investigates each matter.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Franchina acquired injured-on-duty status in 2011 and formally retired from firefighting in 2013, according to her lawyer. She is now working in the medical field and searching for a new career.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“It’s going to harm her for the rest of her life,” Martin said. “You can’t undo what’s happened, can’t fix it. She’s always going to have PTSD, she’s never going to be a firefighter again and that’s something the judge can’t fix.”</p>
<p class="p4">Franchina could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="p4">Firefighters’ Union President Paul Doughty did not respond to a request to comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>R.I. government considers trans rights policy proposal</b></span></p>
<p class="p3">Ken Wagner, the commissioner of Rhode Island, held a hearing earlier this month to gauge public support for a measure that would require all Rhode Island schools to provide protections for transgender students, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180207/ri-hearing-elicits-clashing-views-on-transgender-student-policy">previously reported</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">In accordance with Rhode Island state law, Wagner’s proposals would ask local school districts to implement policies “addressing the rights of transgender and gender non-conforming students to a safe, supportive and non-discriminatory school environment.”</p>
<p class="p3">The hearing inspired debate among Rhode Island constituents who spoke at the event. Because the proposal includes provisions to protect students’ privacy and confidentiality, individuals “expressed the fear that educators might steer children and teens toward medical treatment without notifying their parents,” the Providence Journal previously reported.</p>
<p class="p3">The recent hearing follows the Trump administration’s decision to rescind federal guidelines protecting transgender students. Specifically, the administration revoked Obama-era guidance that used Title IX to protect the rights of transgender youth “to use restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities,” according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/22/516664633/trump-administration-rescinds-obama-rule-on-transgender-students-bathroom-use">NPR</a>.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>A June 2017 <a href="http://riaclu.org/news/post/aclu-report-highlights-need-for-statewide-policy-to-protect-transgender-stu">study</a> conducted by the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union found that 60 percent of Rhode Island schools “have policies in place to protect the rights of transgender students.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The ACLU has been a vocal supporter of the proposal. The proposal also drew support from “educators, clinicians and advocates for transgender people,” the Providence Journal previously reported.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Cicilline to reintroduce assault weapon ban in Congress</b></span></p>
<p class="p3">U.S. Congressman David Cicilline ’83, D-R.I. plans to reintroduce legislation banning assault weapons next week, the Associated Press previously reported.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The bill — which Cicilline describes in a letter currently circulating through Congress — would “prohibit the sale, transfer, manufacture and importation of semi-automatic weapons and ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds,” <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rhode-island/articles/2018-02-21/letter-cicilline-to-reintroduce-assault-weapons-ban">The Associated Press</a> previously reported.</p>
<p class="p3">Past versions of similar legislation have failed to pass Congress.</p>
<p class="p3">Cicilline’s planned legislation will build on a previous assault weapon ban that expired in 2004. His proposal would not affect “hunting rifles and weapons used by military members and law enforcement,” the Associated Press previously reported.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>R.I. Gov. Raimondo faces ethics complaint from R.I. GOP</b></span></p>
<p class="p3">Brandon Bell, the chairman of the Rhode Island Republican Party, filed an ethics complaint against Gov. Gina Raimondo after she struck a “fundraising deal with a local Democratic group which was headed at the time by a state employee,” the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rhode-island/articles/2018-02-12/rhode-island-gop-files-ethics-complaint-against-raimondo">Associated Press</a> previously reported.</p>
<p class="p3">Raimondo partnered with the Providence Democratic City Committee to raise money for her re-election bid in the upcoming gubernatorial election. However, the committee was chaired by Patrick Ward, who was hired by Raimondo’s administration in June to work in the state’s Department of Human Services.</p>
<p class="p3">Bell argues that this partnership is an unethical financial transaction as Ward was previously Raimondo’s subordinate.</p>
<p class="p3">“Hiring a local party leader as a state employee and then entering into a secret fundraising agreement with this subordinate goes too far and crosses an ethical line,” according to a <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/politics/ri-republican-party-files-ethics-complaint-against-raimondo">press release</a> from Bell.</p>
<p class="p3">The partnership has also received criticism as candidates can receive up to $10,000 in donations from individuals through committees as opposed to $1,000 through state parties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On Feb. 12, the U.S. Department of Education confirmed that it would no longer investigate claims of discrimination regarding students’ inability to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identities, BuzzFeed first reported.</p>
<p class="p2">This is the Trump administration’s first explicit confirmation of a policy shift from the Obama-era default of considering gender identity in cases of bathroom use to be protected under Title IX, according to the same BuzzFeed article. The article also said that Liz Hill, spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education, told BuzzFeed that Title IX did not prevent discrimination based on gender identity, and that in school bathrooms, “long-standing regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.”</p>
<p class="p2">Rhode Island LGBTQ+ advocacy groups condemned the national policy. “The decision of the U.S. Department of Education to not investigate discrimination against trans youth is unconscionable,” said Elana Rosenberg, executive director of Youth Pride Rhode Island, according to a press release from LGBTQ Action R.I. LGBTQ Action R.I. also condemned the policy, according to the press release.</p>
<p class="p2">“It certainly seems like this administration does not have the best interests of LGBTQ students at heart,” said Wendy Becker ’83, volunteer for Youth Pride Rhode Island and assistant professor at Rhode Island College. This context means the administration’s policy is a “proactive stance against trans kids,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">“I think it’s a slight (of LGBTQ+ youth) based on fear,” said Gloria Crist, drama advisor at Tiverton High School. The fear stems from the irrational assumption that if sex-regulated bathroom use were relaxed for transgender students, the risk of sexual assault in bathrooms would increase. But “using the bathroom doesn’t mean (anyone) is going to get sexually assaulted,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">Becker also described the policy as constituting “unnecessary fear,” and questioned the purpose of this policy stance. “In most places, trans kids go to the bathroom, and nobody talks about it, and nobody notices, and (everything just happens). … Trans kids have been using facilities that match their gender identity for a while now,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">In Rhode Island, this national policy is unlikely to have an effect given statewide non-discrimination law related to gender identity, Becker said. Even without the national policy affecting students in Rhode Island, however, transgender students can face harassment in school. Having previously worked as a school social worker and the manager of Youth Pride Rhode Island, Becker saw “kids really be harassed in school” based on their gender identities, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">In the case of bathrooms, she knew of transgender students who would avoid using the bathroom the entire day, Becker said.</p>
<p class="p2">“The bathroom and other gendered spaces become a real difficult place for them; they feel caught in wanting to live as genuine human beings, but they’re fearful of what people are going to do or say — and that’s not a way to live,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">Crist praised her school and the entire Tiverton district for having “an incredible non-discriminant(ion) policy.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “To diminish the experience of trans kids at this time is really the opposite of the way we should be going,” Becker said, as opposed to “more information, more teacher training, more policy to really help schools with what they can do to provide appropriate environments for all their students.” </span></p>
<p class="p2">“We need to do better at letting (transgender students) know that it’s okay to be their genuine selves and use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity — and the idea that we would do anything but that is really terrible,” Becker said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">State Senator Minority Whip Nicholas Kettle, R–21, resigned Feb. 22 amid a multitude of legal charges. Kettle was arrested Feb. 16 for two counts of extorting sex from a Rhode Island State House page in 2011 and an unrelated charge of video voyeurism. Kettle was released on personal recognizance on Monday after pleading not guilty, according to the Providence Journal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kettle released a statement yesterday regarding his resignation, thanking his constituents for the privilege of seven years of service. “However, I am extremely disappointed in Senate Leadership on both sides of the aisle,” the statement read. Kettle claimed that both Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, D–4, and Senate Minority Leader Dennis Algiere, R–38, did not “understand the importance of due process as a cornerstone of our legal system.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bipartisan legislation filed on Feb. 21 to expel Kettle from the Senate was sponsored by Ruggerio and Algiere, among others. Senators are allowed to expel members with a two-thirds vote under Article VI, Section 7 of the Rhode Island State Constitution. This would have been an unprecedented move for the State legislature, which has not expelled a member using Article VI since 1843, according to the Providence Journal. The vote was planned for Feb. 27.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The day before the legislation was filed, American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Steven Brown, in a letter to Senate members, asked that they tread carefully. “Rather than rush an expulsion vote, we believe it is critical for the Senate to first consider the ground rules for this novel process,” the letter read. The ACLU acknowledged the seriousness of the charges brought against Kettle but remained adamant that expelling him immediately could set a dangerous precedent. “I don’t think that the Senate set a very good precedent with the way it approached this issue,” Brown told The Herald. “I remain hopeful that if and when this comes around again, the Senate will take a much more deliberate approach.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Upon Kettle’s resignation, Ruggerio and Algiere released separate statements. “I believe that the decision Mr. Kettle made today is in the best interests of the Senate and the state. I certainly respect his right to due process, and the proceedings contemplated in the Senate were not being taken lightly,” Ruggerio’s statement read, adding that Kettle’s actions were “unlike any I have witnessed during my time in the Senate.” Algiere’s statement also acknowledged Kettle’s request for due process and asserted that the Senate has “an obligation to provide a safe work environment for all employees.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to WPRI, former House Rep. for District 41 Michael Marcello said he is considering running for Kettle’s empty seat in 2018. “I’ve been heartened by the number of people who have encouraged me to run, and I will give it serious consideration,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Artemis Project makes STEM accessible to underrepresented genders</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Over 20 years ago, Laurie Kardos ’98 and Jesse Marmon ’97 founded The Artemis Project while they were undergraduates in the computer science department. To this day, the project continues to provide free educational programming in STEM to rising ninth grade students of underrepresented genders. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> The Artemis Project was created to maintain interest in math and science among girls entering high school, said Anne Spalter ’87, an Artemis Project collaborator. “It was based on research that showed that a lot of girls were interested in math and science, but something dramatic happened between 8th and 9th grade,” she added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The goal of the project was orginally to make computer science courses more accessible for this demographic, said Professor of Computer Science Andy van Dam, who serves as a lecturer at The Artemis Project. “We sponsored it through the National Science Foundation grant, and (Spalter) and I did some lectures, and over the years it came to have its current form.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(The Artemis Project) has morphed over the years,” and has now become a mix of general science and computer science, van Dam added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The idea is that it would be project-based, and there would be field trips and bonding exercises of various kinds so that it wasn’t just summer school. It was meant to be kind of a combination of summer school and summer camp,” hesaid.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Exposure to upper-level educational resources largely impacts the future decisions kids can make about college and what interests they pursue, Spalter said. With this in mind, The Artemis Project brings a small group of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>pre-high school students of underrepresented genders to campus for five weeks. “They (have) literally never walked onto a college campus, so just being there and feeling like they could go to college was a huge thing,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I find (the students) incredibly enthusiastic and fearless … they really enjoy being taken seriously,” van Dam said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nirva LaFortune, an alumnus of The Artemis Project, is the manager and advisor of the Presidential Scholars Program at Brown and also serves a representative of Ward 3 on Providence City Council. LaFortune noted the importance of students having role models who look like them in college environments. “When you’re in a community where no one in your family has gone to college, you don’t have a model to follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t have a model. But having this experience provided me with a network, and so we have to teach our kids how to build their network of resources,” she said.The group LaFortune was a part of was comprised of girls from myriad backgrounds, which improved their experience, she said. “A lot of our activities were focused on team building … but we were also forming a community amongst ourselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had space to discuss issues that impacted us,” LaFortune said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“You never know what’s going to change someone’s future. Sometimes just meeting one person, one experience, can have a huge impact,” Spalter said. The program is successful because of how invested Brown student leaders and teachers are, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We need to provide kids with more access to life outside of their neighborhoods and outside of their communities,” LaFortune added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without resources, kids will continue to be disadvantaged as they compete with others who have access to the necessary resources to be successful, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s important to invest in our youth regardless of the costs because they will eventually re-invest in their communities, LaFortune said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sometimes the only opportunity for kids to be exposed to these additional (resources) is when they have these summer opportunities,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">LaFortune said she wants to advocate for more student resources and partnerships with universities. “These are opportunities to develop leaders. People who are able to cultivate these ideas and bring it back into their communities,” LaFortune said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There is still inadequate attention being paid to schools that don’t have as many resources … the more enrichment programs after school and during the summer, the better,” van Dam said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>DPS, students discuss safety concerns on College Hill</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Nov. 8, Eliza Hicks ’21 went to bed with her laptop and phone on her desk and her backpack on the ground by her bedpost. When she woke up the next morning, her backpack was gone; she immediately thought she had misplaced it. After checking places she frequents on campus, she asked her roommate, Alexis Jackson ’21, if she had seen it. Jackson told Hicks that she had seen a man in their room the night before.

Both roommates “started crying” when they realized a man in his boxers had been in their room, Hicks said. “He wasn’t really in any rush to get out of here,” Jackson said. “That he could be so close to Eliza … that grosses me out.”

Since the beginning of fall 2017, there have been 51 larcenies, one robbery, one attempted robbery, nine breaking and entering occurrences and one motor vehicle theft on or around campus, according to the Brown DPS weekly incident summaries. The Department of Public Safety’s records and individual students’ stories provide a comprehensive picture of safety on College Hill.

Nearly half of the larcenies were bikes, with 23 stolen bikes reported to DPS since last September. Other frequently stolen items include backpacks, wallets, computers and cellphones.

DPS crime reports do not include sensitive incidents. Hicks’ experience is not in the DPS crime report. This is often to prevent identifying information — particularly in cases of assault — from reaching the public, said University Deputy Chief of Police Paul Shanley, adding that these reports can be found in the Clery log in DPS Headquarters at 75 Charlesfield Street.

The four buildings that have seen most theft are all located within the same half-mile radius; the Facilities Management building at 295 Lloyd Ave., Pizzitola Sports Center, the  Olney-Margolies Athletic Center and Jonathan Nelson ’77 Fitness Center each had more than three incidents reported since September.

Shanley believes that most theft is carried out by individuals outside of the University community. For example, if there is a pick-up game of basketball at the OMAC, “someone might let someone who isn’t a part of the Brown community in,” Shanley said, adding that it’s those individuals who have a tendency to take things.

In Hicks’ case, she believes that the theft was carried out by a Brown student.

The afternoon of Nov. 9, the stolen backpack was left in the hallway of Hicks’ and Jackson’s dorm and later found by a Resident Peer Leader. This led both Jackson and Hicks to believe the man who had been in their room was a Brown student. “I got my backpack back, but I was still affected by it,” Hicks said. “I felt disempowered.”

After she discovered the theft, Hicks first went to an RPL, who then helped her file a report with Brown DPS. But Hicks felt blamed by the DPS officer, as he responded by saying  “you should have locked your door,” she said.

On the other hand, the University, including the Office of Residential Life, was supportive when she reported the incident, she said. They immediately offered to change her lock at no charge, as her key had been in the stolen backpack.

“The assistant dean of students sent me an email so the school took some formal steps which is nice,” Hicks said. Jackson said she received emails from administration as well.

Both roommates still believe it’s important to know these things do happen on campus. “I think people should lock their doors,” Hicks said.

According to Shanley, students can help prevent stealing by staying vigilant and not holding the door open for individuals who might not have swipe access to the building.

“We try to preach awareness,” he said. “We believe Brown is a safe campus … especially for an urban campus,” he added.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>City police participate in LGBTQ+ inclusivity training</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/27/city-police-participate-lgbtq-inclusivity-training/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By the end of this week, the Providence Police Department will have finished providing new LGBTQ+ inclusivity training to all of its in-service officers, said Providence Police Captain Kevin Lanni. Two hundred fifty-two Providence police officers have already completed the program, he added.

“We’re reflecting (on and) evaluating how we can better serve different groups within the community,” Lanni said, adding that LGBTQ+ sensitivity training would encourage individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ to “feel comfortable calling the police knowing they’ll be treated with respect.”

The program came to fruition in part thanks to Jodi Glass of the Rhode Island Commission on Prejudice and Bias, who reached out to the Providence Police Department in 2016 following the Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando.

As a result of Glass’ efforts, the PPD, the Rhode Island Commission on Prejudice and Bias, Sojourner House and the Providence Human Relations Commission came together to create the Providence LGBTQ+ partnership. The city received an Open Societies Foundation Grant to fund the program, said Sojourner House’s Director of Operations Sarah DeCataldo.

The partnership has “evolved substantially” over the last two years, DeCataldo added.

The LGBTQ+ inclusivity curriculum was officially mandated to be administered department-wide in January after a successful set of trainings with the 68th recruit academy in summer 2017. The recruits completed a retrospective evaluation at the completion of the program and demonstrated improvement in their “thoughts, feelings, attitudes and knowledge” about LGBTQ+ issues, DeCataldo said.

The trainings — which last four hours according to DeCataldo —  address and explore four facets of identity: sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and biological sex, DeCataldo said. The session works to help officers move away from interpreting gender and sexual orientation as binaries and rather understand them as spectrums.

The program seeks to encourage effective communication regarding LGBTQ+ issues by providing officers with a more nuanced and inclusive vocabulary, DeCataldo said. It also highlights the barriers that have historically existed between the LGBTQ+ community and the police.

“There’s so much history as to why LGBTQ communities can’t trust law enforcement (and) why communities of color can’t trust law enforcement,” Glass said.

“I have been training law enforcement in Rhode Island for almost 15 years on various issues, and I have never received as much positive feedback about a training … as I have with this one,” DeCataldo said. “We had officers come up to us on breaks, in between sessions (and) before sessions just to say ‘this was really helpful, I learned so much, thank you so much.’”

Moving forward, Glass hopes that the trainings continue to enable officers to responsibly report and respond to hate crimes. “What is lacking is community-police relationships,” Glass said.

“My personal ongoing feeling is that if we can get in the door and build relationships, that’s what’s going to make the difference,” Glass added.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Financial ethics complaint against Raimondo dismissed</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On Feb. 27, the Rhode Island Ethics Commission voted 5-to-1 to dismiss an ethics complaint filed by GOP Chairman Brandon Bell against Gov. Gina Raimondo, according to a report released by the Commission yesterday. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bell’s complaint alleged that a Jan. 31 fundraising agreement between Raimondo’s re-election campaign and the Providence Democratic City Committee violated Regulation 36-14-5011, which prohibits financial transactions between employers and their employees. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Providence Democratic City Committee’s Chairman, Patrick Ward, was a state employee at the time of the incident. Raimondo hired Ward in June 2017 as the chief of program development for the Rhode Island Department of Human Services at a salary of $71,608, according to the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180227/ethics-commission-dismisses-complaint-over-raimondo-fundraising-deal">Providence Journal</a>. Ward resigned from his position as Chairman Feb. 9 this year following backlash from a controversial meme he posted on Facebook.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Commission’s ruling stated that because Ward was not a department head or working in the governor’s office, he was not under the “direct control and supervision” of Raimondo, which meant that the agreement did not violate the state ethics code. The Commission based its ruling on precedent from a 2006 case involving state employees and then-governor Donald Carcieri. In that case, the Commission ruled that “employees who served in other (executive) branch agencies, with multiple layers of supervision between that employee and the governor, were not direct subordinates,” said Jason Gramitt, an attorney for the Rhode Island Ethics Commission. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The Ethics Commission ignored the fact that Mr. Ward is a subordinate of Governor Raimondo’s appointee at the Department of Human Services,” Bell said in a statement following the Commission’s decision. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo’s campaign did not initially announce its fundraising agreement with the Committee to the public. Following media coverage of this agreement’s existence, Raimondo’s office still did not release the contents of the agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under pressure from a <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/20180215/editorial-governor-should-release-deal">Providence Journal editorial</a>, the R.I. GOP and members of Raimondo’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>party who had not seen the agreement, the governor finally released the two-page document Feb. 18, more than two weeks after it was signed. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the agreement, the Committee stated that it would authorize Ward to open three different bank accounts, one federal and two nonfederal, for Raimondo’s campaign funds. The Committee promised that Ward would be the only person with the authority to “spend, transfer and otherwise disburse funds” from these three accounts, as well as have the power to designate other people to act on his behalf, the agreement stated. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Ward would have complete control over how the money would be spent, while Raimondo had control over Ward as her subordinate state employee,” Bell said in a statement following the agreement’s release.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The agreement included a plan for the Committee to develop a coordinated budget with the campaign. But it also stipulated that donors to the Committee could not assign their contribution to a distinct Democratic candidate. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Committee and Raimondo’s campaign said in the agreement that their arrangement did not “create any relationship of employer and employee or of master and servant.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The agreement allows Raimondo to bolster her fundraising, said John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, a nonprofit focusing on government accountability. “Under R.I. law, donors can only give $1,000 per year to campaign but $10,000 to a party committee; we presume that she has donors who are maxed out to her campaign,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“She is clearly going to face a spirited re-election campaign, ... and she is looking for creative ways to use one of her strongest advantages as a candidate, which is her national fundraising network,” Marion said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo’s campaign has a balance of over $3.3 million, significantly greater funds than those raised by her gubernatorial opponent Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, according to <a href="http://ripr.org/post/common-cause-raimondo-providence-democrat-agreement-doesnt-appear-violate-ethics-rules#stream/0">Rhode Island Public Radio</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Had Raimondo been a federal employee, her agreement with Ward would have been prohibited, since federal employees are barred from engaging in partisan activities under the Hatch Act of 1939, Marion said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“You don’t want government employees to feel that they have to support candidates in order to maintain their jobs,” Marion said. “If you want a professional bureaucracy, it shouldn’t be subject to the whims of partisan politics.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo’s office could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Fifteen-year-old Adah Bryan urged lawmakers to do more to prevent gun violence, listing off the mass shootings that had occurred in her lifetime before a crowd of over a hundred community members gathered in the State House rotunda Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“People say we’re too young to know what we’re talking about, but I’m a young adult who has seen these shootings over and over and over again,” said Bryan, a ninth grader from Classical High School. “Laws need to be passed, action needs to be taken.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Don’t let us be the next Parkland, the next Sandy Hook, the next Columbine,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence organized the rally in support of the “Rhode Island Assault Weapons Ban Act of 2018.” The bill was introduced into the R.I. General Assembly by Senator Josh Miller D-Cranston, Providence and Representative Jason Knight D-Bristol, Warren on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The legislation (2018-S 2493) would ban the sale and ownership of semiautomatic rifles, pistols and shotguns — including the AR-15 rifle, a weapon used in a series of mass shootings including Sandy Hook and, recently, Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida Feb. 14. The bill has 29 sponsors in the House and 18 in the Senate, according to a press release from the R.I. General Assembly. Ten states, including Massachusetts and Connecticut, have passed similar legislation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“These (assault) weapons have so much more lethality than just a regular shotgun or handgun,” said Linda Finn, president of RICAGV. “It’s really important to keep them off the streets and away from people.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The bill would also prohibit “large capacity” magazines that would accept more than ten rounds of ammunition.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Currently Rhode Island only allows five rounds of magazine capacity for deer hunting and three rounds for duck hunting, RICAGV stated in a press release. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, the bill does allow for the continued use of some “grandfathered” assault weapons and exempts R.I. peace officers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Last week, Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order, the “Red Flag Law,” directing law enforcement agencies to remove guns from individuals who display signs — including on social media — that they may be a public safety threat. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo told the crowd that she had felt motivated to enact gun control reform after her 13-year-old daughter demanded to know what she had been doing about gun violence in Rhode Island. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve had enough talking,” Raimondo said. “Get me the bill and I’ll sign it!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lawmakers and activists stressed the importance of listening to the voices of youth in the gun control debate. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Taliq Tillman, a student at the Met School, expressed anger at feeling “overwhelmingly helpless” after hearing about the Parkland shooting, especially following inaction from many lawmakers. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Silence is tiring, draining and infuriating,” Tillman said. “Silence is another word for acceptance.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I stand here today because I believe in myself, my peers and youth, and I believe that we can shape national narratives,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Enough is enough,” the crowd chanted in support, many wearing orange shirts in solidarity with the Parkland survivors. “Protect kids, not guns” read one sign, while others hoisted white sheets of paper splattered with red paint. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not everyone at the rally came in support of the legislation. “There’s a lot more that we can do (to prevent mass shootings) than simply taking away my weapons or infringing upon my rights,” said Greg Brown, a member of both the R.I. Second Amendment Coalition and the NRA. Restricting access to guns could make it more difficult for “good guys” to stop school shootings, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">John Rinaldi, president and founder of the Sandy Hook Center, told The Herald that although he supported Raimondo’s executive order and the state’s assault weapons ban, he remained pessimistic about the National Rifle Association’s lobby power on federal and state levels. Since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, the gun control movement has been “drowned out by the NRA influence,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If people cannot relate or don’t want to actualize the reality of our kids being slaughtered, they will be dismissive, say it’s not an issue, and until you lose your child, you can’t fully comprehend,” Rinaldi said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The issue of gun violence cannot be fixed by only one piece of legislation, said Pete Bilderback, senior program coordinator at the Institute for Brain and Neural Systems and board member of RICAGV. Still, he emphasized the importance of preventative steps like banning assault weapons. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When I go to bed, I lock my door. I’m fully aware that doing so won’t keep a professional burglar out of my house,” Bilderback said. “But I lock it anyway because I don’t want to make it easy for them and that’s what we’re doing right now, we’re making it easy for these crimes to happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Other bills on RICAGV’s legislative agenda for 2018 include the Safe Schools Act to restrict concealed carry weapons in K-12 schools and a Gun Violence Restraining Order that prevents individuals who endanger themselves or those around them from buying or owning firearms or ammunition. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A national school walkout is planned for March 14 to protest gun violence in light of the Parkland shooting. Providence high school students will be participating, Bryan said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think that this year is going to be a different year because of (student) voices — you can’t ignore those voices,” Miller said. “This is a large chorus that can’t be denied and it will not stop at red flags, it will not stop at bump stocks, it will not stop at magazines, it will not stop at assault weapons. It will stop when we hear from our schools and our teachers that they feel safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The NRA did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">University students lobbied for a bill designed to eliminate housing discrimination against homeless individuals<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tuesday afternoon at the Rhode Island State House. House Bill No. 7528, entitled “An Act Relating to Property — Fair Housing Practices,” was introduced to the House Committee on Judiciary by seven Democratic representatives.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The bill will allow more of Rhode Island’s homeless community to find housing, said Morgan Talbot ’18, advocacy director for Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere. Without this legislation, landlords can discriminate against buyers in the Housing Choice Voucher program, which gives supplemented rent to those that score highest on the homelessness vulnerability index form, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As part of their research, HOPE finds housing listings that discriminate against potential buyers who receive vouchers. “It’s pretty sad to see these,” Talbot said. “Sometimes it’s like, ‘No dogs, no smoking, no Section 8.’”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maritiza Del Rosa, a Rhode Island constitutent who has experienced homelessness, was already inside the State House when students arrived. As Del Rosa walked around the House chamber with Executive Director of HOPE Gabe Zimmerman ’18, she shared her own story. She explained how difficult it was to get back on her feet and to raise children out of a shelter, where she still lives. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Everyone deserves a home,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">HOPE reached out to Del Rosa to tell her about the bill’s introduction after she left her contact information on a HOPE survey indicating her interest in advocacy. <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/27/hope-membership-influence-grows-rhode-island/">The survey</a>, which asked 200 Rhode Islanders experiencing homelessness what prevented them from finding stable housing, revealed “lack of affordable housing” and “sources of income” to be the leading causes, Talbot said. The bill would address concerns surrounding “sources of income” by outlawing discrimination against those who receive money from the government, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before the bill’s introduction at the State House, it had not seen much opposition, Talbot said. Mandated Section 8 inspections were included in the 2017 version of the bill, which passed the Senate but died in the House, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We don’t think (the bill) is going to be a hassle for landlords,” Talbot said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some landlords actually encourage those with vouchers to apply for housing because they are guaranteed payment from them, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> State Representative Anastasia Williams (D-9), one of the bill’s sponsors, emphasized that “safe, sanitary, affordable living accommodations” are a basic human right.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“For far too long many of us haven’t been able to rest easy … especially those of us with children,” Williams said, adding that the “affordable housing” that is created isn’t always as affordable as it seems.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before the House convened, students from HOPE and the Brown Progressive Action Committee approached representatives to advocate on behalf of the bill. Many cited similar bills that exist in Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut. Most representatives were receptive to the students’ pitch; some said they had to look over the bill before they could make promises, while others were busy getting signatures and sponsors for other pieces of legislation and asked if they could discuss the bill later.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When the bell on the House floor started to ring, most of the legislators, lobbyists and aids ignored it until the Speaker banged his gavel and the session began, at which point advocates were asked to leave the chamber. Outside, both Zimmerman and Del Rosa spoke fondly of their advocacy experiences. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We got a lot of information on where legislators stand,” Zimmerman said. “For many students, it was their first time on The Hill,” he added, happy that the group was able to include constituents who had experienced homelessness. Del Rosa was also pleased to have lobbied, although she admitted that she had been nervous. She posed with her son and Zimmerman for a photo in the State House to mark the moment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our goal, ultimately, is to end homelessness in Rhode Island,” Talbot said, “which we firmly believe is possible.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The bill will be discussed at the Senate Judiciary meeting on Thursday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Giovanni Feroce joins Rhode Island gubernatorial race candidates</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Friday, Giovanni Feroce filed papers with the Rhode Island Board of Elections to run as a Republican in the state gubernatorial race, joining candidates R.I. House Minority leader Patricia Morgan, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, former representative Joe Trillo and Democratic incumbent Gina Raimondo.

Morgan was the first Republican to announce her candidacy in October. Fung announced his candidacy one <a href="http://wpri.com/2017/10/24/fung-expected-to-announce-candidacy-for-governor/">day later</a>, and former Republican Joe Trillo announced in December he would run as an independent, <a href="http://wpri.com/2017/10/24/fung-expected-to-announce-candidacy-for-governor/">WPRI reported</a>.

“I have a vision that requires hubris, frankly,” Feroce said. Feroce would prioritize education, jobs and retirement planning, he said. “My vision for Rhode Island is one that plugs into the state of Massachusetts and primarily focuses on Boston as the center of gravity,” he said. He compared Providence’s relationship to Boston to Stamford, Connecticut, feeding into New York; younger people in particular should see the distance between Providence and Boston as being  “a 45-minute commute or a 50-minute commute,” he added. In addition, Feroce imagines residents of Connecticut and Massachusetts moving to R.I. for the quality of life. “It’s a better living environment, it’s a better community to ultimately raise a family or plug into additional educational institutions,” Feroce said.

Feroce feels qualified as a candidate by his experience participating in “strategic planning … in the military, in business, in politics,” he said. Feroce served as a military officer, was a state senator for Rhode Island for two years and served as the CEO of the jewelry company Alex and Ani between 2010 and 2014, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180102/giovanni-feroce-my-new-years-resolution-is-to-become-your-next-governor">previously reported</a>. Since then, Feroce has headed multiple enterprises, most notably Benrus, a military watch company.

In September 2017, Feroce was banned from running Benrus when he could not pay the trademark owner the agreed amount, after being sued by creditors including the Internal Revenue Service, according to the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171129/feroce-banned-from-running-benrus?">Providence Journal.</a>

“Statistically, you’re always going to (have) some things that don’t go your way — you’re going to have some things (go) perfectly and some things that you’ve got to take a little bit more time to see mature into a success story,” he said. “So I certainly don’t look at anything I’ve done in a negative way in any way,” he added.

As of the last fiscal quarter of the 2017 fiscal year, Raimondo has raised $3,349,632, around 14 times Fung’s balance of $240,572.83. Trillo’s balance stands at $126,858.58, while Morgan has raised $117,330.97. Feroce began fundraising in the first fiscal quarter of the 2018 fiscal year; his balance is not currently publically available because the funds raised in the ongoing fiscal year are not public for any candidates.

All the Republican guberanorial candidates have political experience. And while Feroce stressed that his business experience sets him apart as a candidate, Morgan cited her credentials in politics as a defining asset to her campaign.

Morgan is running because her eight years of experience in the R.I. House of Representatives and five years on the finance committee have informed her understanding of “what needs to happen” to improve the economy and citizens’ lives as governor, she said.

Morgan values prioritizing the issues of  corruption, education and jobs. She sees “soft corruption” in the existence and advantages of “insiders, people with access” and described the Pawtucket Red Sox stadium project as a job controlled by business insiders. “They had access to state leaders and decided they wanted some of our tax dollars,” she said.

“I don’t think it’s fair to … ask folks to be the wallet,” she added.

In terms of education, Morgan, a former teacher, wants to “set teachers free” by giving them flexibility to better cater to individual students’ needs and also providing them with more resources, including textbooks and teacher manuals.

In his 16 years in government, Trillo noted every day “what a disaster our state was turning into,” he said. He is running as an independent because of internal divisions within both parties, and feels confident in his ability to collaborate with Democrats and Republicans, he said. He hopes to make jobs a priority and to bring Rhode Island up from the “bottom of the ratings” for business, he added.

Trillo plans on funding the majority of his campaign himself, he said. He will not be seeking funding from “political action groups, special interests, NRA, nothing that corrupts government” because “the more money they give you, the more (concessions) they expect,” he added.

In a television ad announcing his bid for governor, Fung said he hoped to focus on job creation and improving infrastructure, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171024/with-tv-ad-allan-fung-enters-race-for-governor">reported</a>.

Last week, Morgan criticized Allan Fung for not initially commenting on gun control and for consistently failing to clarify his policy views since his 2014 run for governor, according to the<a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180228/fung-facing-criticism-from-all-sides-over-gun-stance"> Providence Journal</a>. “In four years he has been absent when there has been a need for any opinion on his part; school shooting is just the latest, but it’s not the first,” she said.

Ethan Shire ’19, president of Brown Republicans, said the the group hasn’t “made a formal endorsement yet.” However, the Republicans “have a longstanding relationship with Mayor Fung.” Brown Republicans supported Fung’s 2014 campaign for governor, added Shire, who is also a Herald columnist.

Looking beyond the primary to the general election, statewide elections in Rhode Island “see a lot of arguing between the 40-yard lines, where you kind of have a really more liberal-leaning Republican and a more conservative Democrat, … and I think that’s kind of what we’re going to see probably in this gubernatorial election,” Shire added.

Mayor Fung did not respond to request for comment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[State law enforcement and politicians continue to debate gun regulation following the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida earlier this month. The Rhode Island State Police and the Rhode Island State Council of Churches clashed after RISP Captain Derek Borek informed the congregation at St. James Episcopal Church that he advises law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons in church services. Borek stated that his remark, given during an active shooter training Feb.17, does not indicate a change in state policy, but rather is consistent with standard protocol.

“Unfortunately, in society today, we have to think about what we would do in that type of situation,” Borek said. “It’s sad that we have to think about (shootings) in our churches or in our schools.”

In response to Borek’s assertion, the RISCC issued a statement saying that it does not support the presence of concealed weapons in church.

“A house of worship is a safe space for anyone to be able to come into, any person who feels vulnerable on any level,” said the Rev. Dr. Donald Anderson, executive minister of the Council. “The idea of a weapon being present violates that concept.”

Gun control should be prioritized over protocol in response to an active shooter situation, Anderson added.

“To have any conversation about this issue and not make … an elementary step (toward) eliminating assault weapons is absolutely foolish and disingenuous,” he said.

While police and religious authorities discussed gun regulation in churches, Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order instituting a “red flag” policy throughout the state Monday, which aims to ensure that individuals deemed dangerous do not have access to firearms. The order establishes a campaign to educate the public and state police on how to identify and respond to warning signs of individuals who might pose a threat to themselves or to others. It also institutes a gun safety working group, but does not expand the capacity of law enforcement to take firearms away from individuals.

“The Parkland shooting highlighted the urgency of action,” said Josh Block, press secretary to the governor. “The Governor stepped up and took decsive, executive action to make Rhode Island safer,” Block added. She also declared her support for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines during a press conference Tuesday, as The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/27/community-rallies-assault-weapons-ban/">previously reported.</a>

Raimondo’s executive order lays the groundwork for the Rhode Island General Assembly to pass a proposed red flag law, which would permanently establish the conditions set out by the executive order and expand law enforcement’s authority to confiscate firearms, Raimondo said during the press conference.

R.I. lawmakers have proposed other bills to address gun reglation. State Senator Gayle Goldin (D-3) introduced a bill banning high-capacity magazines earlier this month, which she is hopeful will pass, she said.

In addition to political and policy-based action, Borek and other members of the police force are continuing active shooter trainings throughout the state.

“You should have a plan in place, you should visualize what you would do in that plan and then have situation awareness,” he said.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lifespan will begin formal talks with Care New England and Partners HealthCare about working together to improve health care in Rhode Island, according to a joint statement released by the three parties Tuesday. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“By combining the talent, experience and resources of our like-minded, provider-based organizations, we envision creating a national model that fully leverages the integration and coordination of care,” the statement read. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lifespan — Rhode Island’s first health care system — currently operates more than 15 medical facilities within the state. Lifespan also has a history of working with the University, facilitating trainings at Alpert Medical School.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Jan. 25, Boston-based Partners HealthCare and local health care group CNE formally agreed to merge, as The Herald previously reported.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">President Christina Paxson P’19 initially expressed her concern with Partners HealthCare’s acquisition of CNE in a community-wide email Jan. 11, as The Herald previously reported.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In particular, Paxson was concerned about specialty care moving out of state to Massachusetts and health care costs in Rhode Island increasing as a result of the CNE-Partners deal. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In her email, Paxson proposed an alternate deal for the University to work with California-based for-profit organization Prospect Medical Holdings, Inc. to merge with CNE.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Brown announced its hope that, with Prospect Medical, the University would have the opportunity to present a proposal for a local acquisition of Care New England. Brown is committed to investing in Rhode Island health care,” Paxson wrote in an op-ed published by the Providence Journal Jan. 20. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Brown’s proposal has not been without criticism. A representative of CNE did not react favorably to the Brown-Prospect proposal, describing it as an attempt to “acquire and split up the Care New England Health System — a process undertaken of their own independent action and interests,” as The Herald previously reported.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Representatives of United Nurses and Allied Professionals also criticized the University for partnering with Prospect. Linda McDonald, president of Rhode Island United Nurses and Allied Professionals, referenced Prospect’s record of providing poor quality services and using contaminated and broken materials that led to “high patient injury and infection rates” in a Herald op-ed. UNAP Director Jack Callaci also noted that Prospect is “not the hometown solution” because it is owned by the venture capital firm Leonard Green and Partners and has allocated $600 million to its stockholders.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast, UNAP supports Lifespan’s entry into negotiations between CNE and Prospect, Callaci said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gov. Gina Raimondo also regarded Lifespan’s negotiations as a positive development. “It’s great to see another local, homegrown Rhode Island institution joining the collaboration. Whatever the proposal, I am focused on making sure costs to Rhode Islanders don’t increase and that medical care, research and teaching all stay in-state,” Raimondo said in a statement, acording to Rhode Island Public Radio. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If Lifespan, CNE and Partners were to merge, the majority of Rhode Island’s medical facilities would be managed by the partnership.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have advocated for this kind of within-state dialogue for years,” Paxson wrote in a statement on Tuesday. Nevertheless, “a business relationship between Partners and Lifespan that further consolidates market power could have additional adverse effects on Rhode Islanders,” Paxson wrote.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The court-ordered payment from an individual who pleaded guilty to growing marijuana will be used to support a new recovery center for teens struggling with addiction, according to <a href="http://www.ri.gov/press/view/32565">a press release</a> from the Attorney General Peter Kilmartin’s office. The $50,000 grant from the criminal restitution case was awarded to The Providence Center — which helps individuals suffering from addiction — to provide support for the new Jim Gillen Anchor Youth Recovery Community Center, according to the press release. The state seized up to $900,000 in assets from the illegal operation, said Amy Kemp, spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Jim Gillen Center is the first institute in Rhode Island that “provides peer-based recovery services” for youth, said Owen Heleen, chief strategy officer of TPC. It serves as a new addition to the Anchor Recovery Community Center programs, which are run through TPC, he said, adding that the idea for the new youth<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>center came from a similar program in Houston. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Most of the state’s previous efforts to combat substance abuse have targetted the ongoing opioid crisis, but “youth substance use disorders most often start out with teens using marijuana and alcohol, which can lead to using other illicit drugs as adults,” Kilmartin said in the press release. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A 2015 report from Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that Rhode Islanders ages 12 to 17 were 28 percent more likely to use illicit drugs than than the average American. “Clearly there is a need for target recovery programs for youth,” Kemp said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Teens are often most susceptible to relapse after school, Heleen added. “For young people with substance use disorder, they may get treatment … and go back to their home high school where it doesn’t take very long before they’re offered substances,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Gillen Center<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>uses a new approach to help individuals recover from substance use disorders — a process called peer-based recovery. “People with lived experiences of addiction help other people who are in recovery maintain their recovery. It’s all about peer(s) providing support,” Heleen said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The new center is currently in a “soft open” stage ­— it is only providing services to students at the Anchor Learning Academy, which is a part of the Anchor Recovery Community Center<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>programs, Heleen said. “They’re our first participants… It will very shortly be expanding to other high schools,” Heleen said. “In the long run we hope to intervene early and help young people stay in recovery.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The number of words children hear in their first three years critically impacts their future development, and children from lower-income families will have heard 30 million fewer words than their peers when they start kindergarten, according to a widely cited University of Kansas <a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf">study</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This word gap harms educational growth — in 2013, two thirds of Providence children starting kindergarten fell short of Rhode Island’s literacy tests, according to a <a href="http://mayorschallenge.bloomberg.org/ideas/providence-talks/">report</a> by Bloomberg Philanthropies. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providence Talks, an early intervention program developed through the mayor’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>office, hopes to close this gap and allow children to enter school with a solid foundation of vocabulary. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mayor Jorge Elorza has slated an additional $500,000 to go towards the program for the 2018 fiscal year. “It’s the only program of its kind working at scale to address this specific issue and we’re proud to have incubated it in our city,” Elorza said in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since 2013, Providence Talks has succeeded in helping more than 2,500 children bolster their vocabularies, according to Executive Director Caitlin Molina. Nearly two-thirds of the children who participated in the program increased their vocabularies and were exposed to 50 percent more words than before they enrolled.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “We look at how we can strengthen the language environment of home,” Molina said. “We need to be sensitive to all of the social and emotional factors in the home and how this impacts the child’s language development.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There are many factors that potentially hinder children’s language development, such as whether they are raised in a single-parent household, the education level of their parents or if their parents work, Molina said. A child that qualifies for the program must be under the age of three, born in Providence and with at least one risk factor identified on the Rhode Island Newborn Screening, Molina said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providence Talks relies on an innovative “talk pedometer” created by the educational technology company LENA, which tracks the number of words and back-and-forth conversational interactions that a child experiences over the course of a day, Molina said. Coaches then analyze a child’s word count to provide complementary guidance strategies for parents and caregivers to enhance their engagement and vocabulary building exercises within the home.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strategies for improving a child’s word exposure include modeling choices during meal time (“Do you want ketchup or mustard?”) and asking open-ended inquiries rather than yes or no questions, Molina said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The pedometer also filters out words from other forms of media, such as television. The context in which children hear these words matters because when children hear words on TV “they are not necessarily processing it,” said Khadija Lewis Khan, executive director of Beautiful Beginnings, a childcare program serving mostly working class families. The center was the first to have its educators trained by Providence Talks and saw its educators increase their daily word count by over 7,000, according to Lewis Khan. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to weekly meetings with eligible parents, Providence Talks has trained over 250 early childhood educators, according to Leslie Gell, director of Ready to Learn Providence, a program at Roger Williams University School of Continuing Studies. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We know that educators are learning and implementing strategies that support language and literacy development, a critical component of kindergarten readiness and school success,” Gell said in a statement. “They are also sustaining the practices, indicating that the beneficiaries are not only their current children but children they will care for in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Providence Talks program is not just for English language learners, Molina said. All trainers speak Spanish as well, and the strategies employed by Providence Talks can work with any language. The key is to strengthen the vocabulary learning environment of the child’s native language, whatever it may be, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s very important for ESL learners to have a good foundation in their own language in order to acquire the English language well,” Lewis Khan said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While it’s clear Providence Talks is making a difference in the lives of many of its participants, Molina hopes to understand which families are benefiting the most from the program, she said. Providence Talks is currently partnering with researcher Kenneth Wong, professor of education policy, on an independent evaluation of the program’s impact. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As partisan politics dominate the health care debate nationwide, the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions unanimously passed a comprehensive childhood cancer bill, co-written by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sen. Jack Reed D-RI, in late February. The legislation, called the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access and Research Act, aims to advance pediatric cancer research, child-focused cancer treatments and childhood cancer surveillance while providing resources for survivors, Reed said in his floor <a href="https://www.reed.senate.gov/news/speeches/reed-introduces-the-childhood-cancer-star-act-of-2015">statement</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reed began working on the issue of childhood cancer after meeting a family whose son had passed away at age nine from neuroblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer. He first proposed legislation on the issue with the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act, which was signed into law in 2008. The act created a comprehensive childhood cancer database for<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/biorepository"> research purposes</a>, which the STAR Act would reauthorize, Reed said. The STAR Act also aims to increase communication about treatment and research between physicians.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Senator Reed included provisions to help improve care not just for those suffering with cancer, but also for survivors of childhood cancer,” said Chip Unruh, press secretary to the senator. As many as two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors will develop a serious or life-threatening illness such as secondary cancers or organ damage, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rebekah Ham, a Rhode Island resident, has personally witnessed the issues associated with suvivorship. Her daughter, Grace Carey, was diagnosed with medulloblastoma at age five. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re so thankful for the treatment and medical care that Grace received, but it also had enormous consequences,” Ham said. “Her eyesight, hearing, growth, hair regrowth and some cognitive issues … have all been affected.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ham hopes the bill can address the need for a network to help survivors navigate their future medical and psychological needs. “You also have to think about how you’re in this community of kids and not everyone survives,” she said. “There’s going to be a bigger population of survivors as we move forward and they are going to have different needs than other people their age.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ham also stressed the importance of increasing opportunities for research. Grace, who has been cancer-free for ten years, underwent brain surgery at Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Rhode Island, followed by radiation proton beam therapy and chemotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“At the time, Mass General was one of five or six centers around the U.S. for proton beam therapy,” Ham said. “I really believe that proton beam therapy saved her life. And without research, that kind of therapy might not exist.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While opportunities for research have grown, certain innovative treatments remain possible only in specific locations. <a href="http://www.proton-therapy.org/map.htm">Proton therapy</a> is not available in state, and the Lifespan Hospital Corporation in Rhode Island signed a five-year agreement with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to send patients with complex needs to the Boston hospital, as reported by the <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2017/03/22/rhode-sland-hospital-group-partners-with-dana.html">Boston Business Journal</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The STAR Act would increase opportunities for research nationwide, which would make cutting-edge treatment more readily available in state. One group working toward advancing research in Rhode Island is the Brown University Oncology Research Group, a division of the Alpert Medical School.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Our goal and our mission is to provide Rhode Island residents and nearby residents the opportunity to remain in state for their care without compromising their ability to participate in novel, early phase cancer trials,” said Kayla Rosati, director of operations for BrUOG. The group, which researches adult cancers, aims to coordinate clinical cancer research for the University’s affiliated hospitals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The STAR Act, alongside BrUOG, hopes to improve the lives of cancer patients and survivors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We need to make sure that health care professionals are able to provide the best follow-up care for these kids in their adolescence and into adulthood, no matter where they live,” Unruh said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since United States Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke announced the Trump administration’s new National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program in early January, the outcry has been swift and persistent, both from the public and private sector. If implemented, the proposal could open 90 percent of U.S. coastal waters for oil drilling, including coastal waters in Rhode Island. Gov. Gina Raimondo, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Kilmartin, officials from the Rhode Island state legislature and R.I. congressional leaders have all made appeals to Sec. Zinke to stop the proposal. Students from the University have also called for the leasing program to be changed. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">State Rep. Lauren Carson (D-Newport) and state Sen. Dawn Euer (D-Newport, Jamestown) introduced identical legislation (H7250 and S2116) after the proposal was made public that would block offshore drilling up to three miles off of Rhode Island’s coast, according to Rhode Island Public Radio. The bill would act as a deterrent for companies that might want to drill off of Rhode Island’s coast and would block the construction of “infrastructure passing through state waters for the purpose of transporting any oil or gas generated by any offshore drilling program into this state.” Similar to Florida Governor Rick Scott, Raimondo sought to convince Sec. Zinke to exempt Rhode Island from offshore drilling and met with him Feb. 25. “(Raimondo) emphasized that Rhode Islanders won’t stand for oil drilling in our waters and called for the same type of exemption as was granted to Florida,” wrote Josh Block, press secretary for Raimondo, in an email to The Herald. Sec. Zinke denied the exemption, but Raimondo “made it clear she will continue fighting for one,” Block added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Separately Kilmartin, along with attorney generals from 12 other states, wrote a letter to Sec. Zinke in an attempt to convince him to reverse the decision. In the letter, Kilmartin stated that Rhode Island’s tourism and fishing industries would be put at risk if companies were to engage in drilling. Kilmartin also formally submitted remarks on behalf of R.I. through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is in charge of leasing policy for the Outer Continental Shelf. “Rhode Island … and all coastal communities benefit greatly from the preservation and protection of our natural resources. Allowing drilling for oil and gas will be detrimental to our economy and our quality of life,” Kilmartin wrote in the letter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Congressman David Cicilline '83 (D-Providence), along with representatives from other New England states, sponsored the New England Coastal Protection Act to oppose the administration’s decision. The act would permanently ban offshore drilling off those states’ coasts. “Rhode Islanders should get to decide what happens off the coast of Rhode Island, not (Trump’s) administration,” Cicilline said. He hopes that the efforts of the New England delegation, coupled with the efforts of state legislatures, will ultimately change Sec. Zinke’s mind. But Cicilline said it will be extremely difficult to bring the bill to a vote due to the Republican stronghold on Congress. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Non-profit organizations like the Conservation Law Foundation are also working to oppose BOEM’s proposal. Vice President and Director of CLF Rhode Island Amy Moses said the foundation is willing to take the matter to court. “CLF has been fighting against offshore drilling for forty years, and we had to take it to court forty years ago so it could happen again,” she said. Moses stressed that, instead of offshore drilling, the administration should focus on renewable energy sources. Moses highlighted other environmental impacts of offshore drilling, including species endangerment, specifically of the north Atlantic right whale. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It makes absolutely no sense. In general, the drilling offshore puts our wildlife, fisheries, our tourism industry and our coastal economies all at risk,” Moses said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Students from the University have also expressed their outrage at the decision. Lauren Maunus ’19, a member of the Rhode Island Student Climate Coalition, attended an event Feb. 28 hosted by BOEM to hear comments from citizens. “Instead of facilitating a discussion where (BOEM) would listen to the voice of the people … they set up tables and they had computers up for people to submit public comment through an online submissions and nothing else,” Maunus said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When organizers from Climate Action Rhode Island, a political action group that advocates for environmental protections, heard about BOEM’s plans to hold a hearing, about 150 to 200 people came and organized their own hearing, Maunus said. “I think it was a really effective action that generated a lot of public attention,” she added.</span></p>

In fact, she is vice president and director of the Conservation Law Foundation Rhode Island. The Herald regrets the error. </em></strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Number of women in statewide, national races up since 2016</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"> More women are running for office in the Rhode Island General Assembly in this election cycle than previously, according to Rhode Island Public Radio. On a national level, more than twice as many women are running for Congress this year compared to 2016, according to NPR. While the reasons these women have for running vary, the uptick is consistently linked to the 2016 election and misogyny in political discourse, which have acted as catalysts for their political involvement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Among local women running for office for the first time is Justine Caldwell, Democratic candidate for state representative of District 30. A key reason that Caldwell decided to run was a lack of diverse representation in Rhode Island politics. “A lot of the people at the State House are older; they’re mostly white, they’re mostly male and they’re mostly rich, and I don’t think that … is representative of the population in Rhode Island,” Caldwell said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The election of Donald Trump and the loss of Hillary Clinton (were) really a wake-up call for women to see that we have to get involved, and if we continue to stand on the sidelines, then we’re never going to have the seat at the table that we deserve,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Specific policy issues can also play a role in motivating women to run. “Standing up for women’s health and women’s rights” is one of the priorities that has driven more women to run for office, Caldwell added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even with the increase in candidacies, Caldwell noted that women continue to face unique challenges in running for office. Especially as first-time candidates, “there’s a fight to be taken seriously, which men often don’t have,” Caldwell said. This can result in a distortion of the policy issues they champion, including access to abortion and birth control. “Women want to come out about those things because we know how much they matter, and (they) get pigeon-holed as only caring about these issues, which is difficult to overcome,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Terri Cortvriend, who is running for state representative of District 72, echoed this sentiment, stating that though “reproductive rights in the state of Rhode Island” are “underrepresented,” she does not want her campaign to center on this topic.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bridget Valverde is running for Rhode Island State Senate in District 35. She currently serves as vice chair of the Women’s Caucus of the Rhode Island Democratic Party, which was created last year partially in response to the 2016 election and aims “to ensure gender equity in our laws and in our representation,” Valverde said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We need to elect more women. So I’ve decided to put my money where my mouth is, so to speak, and run for office,” Valverde added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In the Rhode Island General Assembly, less than 31 percent of the seats are held by women, but women make up 52 percent of the Rhode Island population,” Valverde said. “And we’re actually doing better as a state than we are nationally,” as women hold less than 20 percent of the seats in Congress, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, many organizations are fighting to increase the national representation of women in upcoming elections. EMILY’s List, which contributes funding to the campaigns of female pro-choice Democrats early on in the election process, has observed an enormous increase in demand for their support since 2016. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Since Election Day 2016, we’ve heard from over 34,000 women who are interested in running for office at some point in their life,” said Alexandra De Luca, press secretary for EMILY’s List. “It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before in our history.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “When women are at the table, you get equal pay legislation; you get maternity care; you get legislation on choice; you get legislation on immigration, because the majority of immigrants are women and families,” De Luca said. “You get good legislation on the environment, because women are very concerned about being able to pass on an earth to their kids.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But hesitancy has kept some women from running for office, De Luca said. “Men wake up in the morning and they look in the mirror and they see a congressman,” whereas women “think that they have to be a lawyer; they think that they have to be previously in office; they think that they have to have $10 million in the bank account in order to run for office,” she said. In fact, all they need to run is a passion for improving their communities, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is also important to acknowledge that “all across the country, it’s definitely not just women who are coming forward and working to either elect women or to stand up for women’s rights; it’s a lot of strong male allies, and I think we’re going to continue to see that going forward,” De Luca added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Adjunct Lecturer in International and Public Affairs Vibha Pinglé emphasized that running for office should not be viewed as the final objective. Rather, an increase in female representation should be viewed as the first step in implementing systematic change in politics to safeguard women’s rights. However, Pinglé said that the #MeToo movement “might still peter out” and result in the election of “a few … women and not do much more, because the women who are elected sort of become part of the system and end up playing by the rules of the system rather than transforming it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite expressing support for a progressive agenda, Pinglé said the greatest challenge to female involvement in politics is learning to reach across the political aisle. “We can’t just speak to women who are like us and ignore women who are not like us; that’s true for women of color, or women of certain economic background, a certain nationality, or ethnicity, or … political view,” Pinglé said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The organization She Should Run holds a mission in precisely this vein, as it is a nonpartisan funder of women’s campaigns. She Should Run has also experienced a dramatic uptick in the number of women expressing interest in running for office. “Prior to the 2016 election, the goal was to have about 400 women in this program, with steady growth, and with the 2016 election happening, we now have around 13,000 women,” said Sofia Pereira, mayor of Arcata, California, and community manager for the organization.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Women must overcome barriers to becoming leaders “whether they’re internal barriers of questioning our qualifications and our readiness to run, (or) external barriers of people underestimating us or not thinking we’re qualified enough or the sexism that can exist on the campaign trail,” Pereira said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">De Luca imagines a future in which organizations such as EMILY’s List are no longer necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maggie’s List, an organization that contributes to conservative women’s campaigns, and The Rhode Island Federation of Republican Women could not be reached for comment.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">After a childhood littered with eviction notices, Providence native Franklin Rivera began adulthood by moving into an apartment last year — and was promptly faced with a leaking roof, hazardous electrical outlets, an unresponsive landlord and the burden of filing a lawsuit. The apartment is so “unlivable” that Rivera has sued his landlord for “not maintaining the apartment and not having a habitable house to live in,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">But the lawsuit may very well prove fruitless for Rivera; his lease is month-to-month, which means the landlord could choose to evict him at any time during the process with only 30 days notice.</p>
<p class="p4">Direct Action for Rights and Equality is hoping to support Rivera and other renters like him by putting rent-stabilization on the Providence ballot this fall, DARE advocates announced at a press conference in February. The initiative would establish the right to a year-long lease and enact regulations that allow rent to increase only once a year and by no more than four percent, said Christopher Samih-Rotondo, community organizer for the Tenant and Homeowner Association at DARE. It would also set up a rent board to publish annual reports on Rhode Island property and mediate disputes between landlords and tenants, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">In order to make it on the city ballot in November, the initiative must collect at least 6,000 signatures from Rhode Island residents. DARE plans to submit the first 1,000 signatures in the next two weeks, Samih-Rotondo said.</p>
<p class="p4">The rent-stabilization campaign comes as more and more renters enter the private housing market in Providence, said Steven Fischbach, supervising attorney for Rhode Island Legal Services Housing Law Center and Foreclosure Prevention Project. The hike in renters follows a foreclosure crisis that dominated the city in the mid-2000s, when high-interest, flexible and non-sustainable loans made it nearly impossible for homeowners to maintain their homes. As a result, many homeowners became renters, Fischbach said.</p>
<p class="p4">“Former homeowners have been pushed into the private rental market. …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the rental market is not set up to absorb them,” Fischbach said, adding that poor credit statuses caused by the crisis make it difficult for potential renters to borrow money.</p>
<p class="p4">The large volume of foreclosures created an excess of relatively low-price housing for investors to purchase, which often forces residents out of their homes to make room for businesses, Fischbach said. For instance, the Trottier family at 40 Grove St. in Federal Hill is facing eviction after the local rental business Providence Student Living purchased the three-family house to lease at a higher price to students, The Providence Journal reported.</p>
<p class="p4">Rent control would help mitigate the consequences of increased rent prices and investment presence, but the city needs to do more, said Betsy Stubblefield Loucks, consultant for Rhode Island Alliance for Healthy Homes.</p>
<p class="p4">“Rent control is certainly a part of the picture of creating more affordable housing stock, but another huge part is healthy housing,” Loucks said, adding that Providence housing stock is one of the oldest in the country and often comes with lead and insulation issues. “We can’t just look at these short, quick fixes without a bigger, broader process.”</p>
<p class="p4">There is also concern among housing advocates that rent control could lead to the exclusion of certain communities in areas that are more desirable to live — landlords tend to try to give apartments with “good deals” to friends and family, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">In addition to DARE’s efforts, nonprofits and legislators in the state are working to address concerns around affordable housing.</p>
<p class="p4">The Housing Opportunities Initiative, a Housing Network of Rhode Island project, is designing a ten-year strategy to respond to the concerns around affordable housing in Providence, Loucks said. The State House has scheduled a hearing to discuss trusts and services for children around the state, she added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Ramen is coming to campus this spring with Boston’s highly rated Ganko Ittetsu slated to open at 215 Thayer St. in May.</p>
<p class="p2">Serving up a unique Sapporo style of ramen, Ken Iwaoka, the restaurant’s owner and head chef, is excited for his shop’s second location to launch on the University’s bustling throughway.</p>
<p class="p2">“Thayer Street is a younger generation,” he said. “It’s more trendy and hip than any other place in Providence, especially because of the students.”Set to occupy the former space of Better Burger Company, Ganko Ittetsu will sit next to fellow neighborhood newcomer Pokeworks, which opened its Thayer location Feb. 2018.</p>
<p class="p2">“I was worried a little bit about competition at first, but then I realized that poke and ramen are so different,” said Shauntel Keys, assistant manager of Pokework’s Providence location. “I’m actually hoping to do some partnership events.”</p>
<p class="p2">Ganko Ittetsu will join a host of Asian style eateries on and around Thayer, including Wow Barbecue, Wong’s Kitchen, Den Den Korean Fried Chicken and Heng Thai and Rotisserie.</p>
<p class="p2">But even with Ken’s Ramen down the hill and Asian options on Thayer, Iwaoka maintains that the Sapporo cooking style of his ramen makes his restaurant unique: The vegetables are caramelized with sauce in the wok before being added to the broth, which is not true of other ramen styles.</p>
<p class="p2">In addition to this specific preparation, Iwaoka carefully selected his recipe’s soy sauce after sampling 50 varieties in Japan. The soy sauce his restaurant uses is imported to the United States solely for Ganko Ittetsu.</p>
<p class="p2">“I spent so much time coming up with the ingredients, and I hope people in Providence who eat ramen will be able to understand and appreciate it,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Iwaoka will work full-time at the Providence location in its beginning months to train new staff members, whom he plans to hire locally, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Many students agree that Ganko Ittetsu will meet a specific demand on College Hill. “I’m a big supporter of ramen, and we don’t have a designated ramen place on Thayer,” said Joanne Won ’21.</p>
<p class="p2">Greg Bohenko, the leasing agent for 215 Thayer St., agreed that ramen will be a unique addition to the area. After seeing the plethora of successful ramen shops in New York and Boston, he recognized a business opportunity in Providence, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">“There’s only one ramen shop in Providence,” he said, referring to Ken’s Ramen. “It’s great ramen down there, but it was missing on Thayer.”</p>
<p class="p2">Some students feel Ganko Ittetsu will be redundant, given the abundance of somewhat similar options. “Den Den is on Thayer and already has great ramen,” said Makena Ehlert ’20. “Let’s get something new,” she said, adding that her ideal pick would be an eatery like salad chain sweetgreen.</p>
<p class="p2">Jimmy Grossman ’18, a self-professed “die-hard ramen fan,” grew up in Oregon eating his mom’s homemade ramen.</p>
<p class="p2">“I don’t go to a lot of ramen places on the East Coast, and I’m not really compelled to find another place because Ken’s Ramen is so good, but I’ll eat my words — literally — when a new place opens up on Thayer,” he said, adding that the closer location will be a big draw for ramen fans at Brown.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’ll hopefully like it as much as I like Ken’s, but that is a high bar,” Grossman said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>State to consider raising minimum wage</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/15/state-consider-raising-minimum-wage/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On March 14, a fight was taking place at the Rhode Island State House — the fight for higher pay. The State Senate Committee on Labor heard four bills yesterday intended to raise the minimum wage. The bills are part of R.I. Democrats’ <a href="https://upriseri.com/news/economics/inequality/2018-02-08-fair-shot-agenda/">Fair Shot Agenda</a>, a legislative package that aims to address growing income disparity within the state.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The minimum wage in Rhode Island is currently $10.10 an hour for most workers and $3.89 an hour for workers receiving gratuities. The first bill, Senate Bill 2244, commonly referred to as “the fight for 15,” would raise the minimum wage for both regular and tipped workers to $15 an hour by 2022 and 2026, respectively. Sen. Jeanine Calkin, D-Warwick, is the primary sponsor of the bill.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The fight for 15 bill is a great piece of legislature,” said Michael Araujo, executive director of Rhode Island Jobs with Justice, a standing coalition of labor unions, community organizations, students and faith groups. “It’s one that we’ve been working on for more than five years now,” he added, explaining that this slow progress can feel like the coalition is falling behind on its goal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jobs with Justice advocates on issues of work-based justice, immigration and civil rights. The organization recruited workers, particularly women and restaurant staff, to testify yesterday in favor of the bills.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Araujo said that while Jobs with Justice would be happy to see the minimum wage raised to $15 an hour, he prefers the second bill that was proposed at the State House yesterday. This legislation, Senate Bill 2247, would increase wages to $11 an hour by 2019 and $12 by 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I personally like that bill better because it allows us to build power around it more,” Araujo said. “The fight for 15 would block off renegotiating, re-engaging workers for about five years. A two-year cycle is better for union-building and collective bargaining.” Legislation is essential to progress, but the strongest impact comes from workers themselves pushing for collective agreements, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But a flaw with this second bill is that it excludes tipped workers, Araujo said. This omission is significant because there are “23,000 tipped workers in Rhode Island, 80 percent of whom are women, more than half of whom are mothers. Forty percent of these mothers are sole providers for their households, so not including this vital, rapidly growing section is a huge oversight,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A third bill, sponsored by state Sen. Gayle Goldin, D-Providence, focuses specifically on workers receiving gratuities. The bill would raise the tipped minimum wage to $9 an hour by 2022 and mandate that this wage be the same as the regular wage by 2023. Araujo said that he strongly supports this piece of legislation as well.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maggie Kain, a waitress from Narragansett who testified in favor of the legislation, echoed the need for change. “Lawmakers need to present the fact that they care about workers and not just businesses,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">She also pointed to a widening gulf between workers and politics. “There is a true belief that government has stopped working for (workers), … (who are) disengaged and negative about their upward mobility.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Josh Block, press secretary for Gov. Gina Raimondo, said the governor is pushing to improve the lives of workers within the state. “Too many Rhode Islanders work full-time jobs and still struggle to make ends meet,” Block said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the past, Raimondo has been an advocate for minimum wage increases. During her tenure, the minimum wage has been raised from $8 an hour in 2014 to $10.10 an hour. Raimondo’s plan would increase the minimum wage to $10.50 in January, Block wrote in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Block did not comment on Raimondo’s position on the four bills proposed at the State House yesterday. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The bills will likely be voted on by the end of April, Araujo said. However, even if any of these pieces of legislation are passed, implementation poses another problem, he added. “Wage theft — not paying workers — is standard business practice,” he said. In his time with Rhode Island Jobs for Justice, Araujo estimates that “nearly every worker (who has approached the organization) has experienced real wage theft in the course of their week.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Araujo emphasized the importance of unionizing and collective bargaining in response to this threat. “We can legislate the best versions of this stuff all day, and we could win real gains … but the real win is when workers are organized together and do the enforcement at the workplace level,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The University canceled the planned exhibition of a house connected to Rosa Parks March 8, citing a “dispute” over the house that is independent of the University, wrote Director of News and Editorial Development Brian Clark in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">The house, which belonged to Parks’ brother Sylvester McCauley, was to be featured in an exhibition on the life and times of Rosa Parks at the WaterFire Arts Center in Providence, The Herald previously reported.</p>
<p class="p4">Steven Cohen, lawyer for the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, claims that the significance of the house has been overplayed by Parks’ niece Rhea McCauley. Cohen claims that Rosa Parks never lived in her brother’s house.</p>
<p class="p4">Both McCauley and Ryan Mendoza, the exhibit’s artist, dispute Cohen’s account. The house was only ever described as belonging to Parks’ brother, they said, adding that Parks fled there in 1957.</p>
<p class="p4">Cohen said he spoke to the General Counsel of the University earlier this year, informing them that, to his knowledge, Rosa Parks never lived in or stayed at the house. According to Cohen, following this conversation, the University conducted an investigation after which they ultimately decided not to feature the house.</p>
<p class="p4">Clark did not confirm or deny that the University conducted an investigation following Cohen’s call. The University is “not in a position to speak about the nature of the dispute,” Clark wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">Cohen believes that going forward with the exhibit would have devalued Parks’ name. “It’s false information,” Cohen said. “False information tends to degrade, or has the potential to degrade, the value of a person’s publicity rights.” The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development has taken legal action in the past to protect their intellectual property rights to the name, likeness and image of Rosa Parks.</p>
<p class="p4">On the other hand, Mendoza and Barnaby Evans, executive artistic director of the WaterFire Arts Center, see the dispute over the house’s legitimacy as a distraction from the goals of the initial exhibition: informing the public about Parks’ life and struggle. “We don’t want to defend ourselves … we want to just talk about Rosa Parks,” Mendoza said. “To turn their backs now on the Rosa Parks house is to silence the family members.”</p>
<p class="p4">Evans said the exhibition of Parks’ brothers’ house sheds light on her desperation — penniless and jobless, she fled to the only place she could afford.</p>
<p class="p4">“The real cost of her leadership as a Civil Rights icon is represented by the fact that she lost her job, she lost her home in Montgomery, and fortunately, Sylvester was able to take her into this home,” Evans said. “She was never occasioned the respect to be able to have an income where she could buy a house of her own. That’s the point.”</p>
<p class="p4">Mendoza chose Brown specifically as the first exhibition place for the house, turning down offers in Europe, including a UNESCO World Heritage site. He felt the house needed to return to America and provide an opportunity to educate the public, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Mendoza and McCauley both said the University did not contact them immediately after deciding to cancel the project. They found out about the cancellation from the press release, after Mendoza had arrived in Providence from Berlin.</p>
The University claims that the artist and all donors were contacted before the decision was announced, according to Clark.
<p class="p4">The fate of the house for the time being remains unclear. The WaterFire Arts Center is looking to see if the exhibit can proceed without support from the University and is hoping to keep the house in Providence, Evans said. “We understand that for legal reasons Brown had to step back … But for us to continue the exhibition we need to find the dollars to cover several of the things which were planned.”</p>
<p class="p4">Partnering with the University provided money for chair rentals, speaker rentals, insurance, security and more, according to Evans.</p>
<p class="p4">According to Mendoza, the University asked for the house to be removed from the WaterFire Arts Center by March 22nd. The University is committed to paying the house’s disassembly and shipping costs, Clark wrote. The artist will decide where the house will be placed, Clark wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">The University paid for the house’s passage from Berlin, where Mendoza lives, to the U.S., with a $45,000 grant from the Nash Family Foundation. The money was offered with the understanding that the house would be shown at an exhibition in Providence.</p>
<p class="p4">Nash Family Foundation board member James Nash said that he feels “betrayed” by the University. “I did not give Brown $45,000 so that the Rosa Parks house could have an all-expenses-paid round trip vacation in Providence,” he said, adding that he intends to fight the exhibit’s cancellation.</p>
<p class="p4">The University was “working with each of the generous donors who had committed to funding the project,” Clark wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s a complete betrayal of the Rosa Parks legacy,” Nash added. “Rosa Parks risked her life for justice, even though the law was on the wrong side of justice. What more perfect betrayal can you have?"</p>
<p class="p4">“If this thing gets sent out of the country, that’s embarrassing,” said Peter Mello, managing director of the WaterFire Arts Center.</p>
<em><strong>Corrections: A previous version of this article stated that James Nash was not contacted by the University before the cancellation decision was made. In fact, Nash was contacted by the University before the cancellation decision was made. The article has also been updated to include the University's offer to allow the artist to decide where the house will be placed. It has also been updated to include the University's claim that the artist and all donors were contacted before the decision was announced. The article also stated that according to Mendoza, the University was asking for the house to be removed from Providence as soon as possible. In fact, Mendoza received a letter from the University stating that house would have to be removed from the WaterFire Arts Center by March 22nd. The article has also been updated to remove the quote, "Brown, because of their pusillanimous fear of a cease and desist order, is demanding the house go back to Germany before any Americans can see it" from James Nash. In fact, the University did not demand the house return to Germany. The Herald regrets the errors.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><em>Updated at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, March 26, 2018. </em></strong>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">When Luis Estrada was released from prison Dec. 21, 2005, he had spent almost half of his life incarcerated. At 23 years old, Estrada participated in a jewelry heist worth $860,000, according to the Providence Journal, and then spent the next 22 years in prison. Estrada was imprisoned for 16 years in the federal system and six years at the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institutions. For the first three and half years of his sentence, Estrada only spent nine months outside of solitary confinement. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I spent two nine-month stays ‘down there,’” Estrada said, explaining that “down there” or “the hole” describe population segregation, otherwise known as “solitary confinement.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There’s no sunlight, no one to talk to,” he said, “It was cold. There was quite a bit of weight loss for me. In nine months, I lost 30 pounds.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Estrada explained that measuring those personal changes was difficult. It was only until he had to “put on court clothes” that he realized how much weight he had lost. “You’re not noticing that you’re getting pale … that you fatigue easily,” Estrada said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I came out more stubborn,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>In “the hole” and out again</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When Estrada was in the R.I. ACI, he said that there were inmates kept in solitary confinement for extended periods of time. In both Rhode Island and across the country, prisons have been grappling with this issue, questioning the value of solitary confinment. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was an “institutional rumor” that John Carillo had his door welded shut during confinement, Estrada said. Carillo, who killed R.I. Correctional Officer Donald Price in 1973 during a prison riot, was dubbed “Rhode Island’s most dangerous inmate” according to the Providence Journal, and was eventually released from solitary confinement in 1980 after he sued the R.I. ACI. Carillo had been spending 23 hours a day in his cell for more than eight years.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“What made that case different was that he killed (a correctional officer). It was horrible what was happening in that case,” said Robert Mann, the lawyer who represented Carillo. Mann still practices criminal defense in R.I. “My sense is that it is not as bad as it was 25 to 30 years ago,” Mann said. He still believes that the state overuses situations that put inmates in limited contact with other people, calling himself a “bleeding heart liberal.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the Carillo case, Mann said that the courts avoided deciding on the constitutional issue of solitary confinement and instead ruled that the R.I. ACI violated Morris Rules. Established in 1983, the Morris Rules were formed out of inmate litigation and negotiation in R.I. and outlined specific procedures for stays in population segregation, according to the case records.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While Mann believes that the R.I. ACI is now imposing shorter segregation periods, he said there is a “semantic argument about what constitutes solitary,” and that there should be a “push to get rid of solitary.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chief of Information and Public Relations Officer for the R.I. Department of Corrections J.R. Ventura says that there are always ways to improve the system and that there are “concerted efforts to make sure we are consistent in our treatment,” adding that, “the way we address discipline is always evolving.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Estrada said that the period he spent in solitary confinement allowed him to reflect and to get sober. “Thirty-one years Feb. 28th, clean and sober,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Today, Estrada is the office manager of a law firm, has four college degrees and, in his own words, has turned his life around. As a sitting board member of OpenDoors, a group that aids reentry into the community for the formerly incarcerated, and several other community groups, Estrada says he sits on a board with a man who once denied him parole five times.</span></p>
<b id="m_-1338332536833679391gmail-docs-internal-guid-f6e1d6e6-549b-dd89-abbe-5458fa6cdfc8">Rhode Island’s prison confinement policies and practices</b><u></u><u></u>

“There’s been serious issues in Rhode Island with the use of solitary confinement,” University of Pittsburgh Law Professor Jules Lobel told The Herald. Lobel has challenged the legality of solitary confinement for decades.<u></u><u></u>

“I think the Rhode Island Director of Corrections is trying to perform, trying to change them. Rhode Island has overused solitary in the past and has kept people in poor conditions,” Lobel said. The system “could use more due process.”<u></u><u></u>

Prisoners who are found guilty of a disciplinary infraction can be placed in disciplinary confinement for zero days to a year, wrote Susan Perez, programming services officer at the state of Rhode Island Department of Corrections, in an email to The Herald. To receive more than 30 days of of disciplinary confinement, an inmate must have “caused serious injury, immense damage, or posed a severe threat to institutional or public safety,” she wrote.<u></u><u></u>

To prisoners, a 30-day segregation period is called a “rest” — a vacation from the constant pressure that looms over inmates, Estrada said. “That’s only a sleepover.”<u></u><u></u>

When legislation or policies have been suggested to decrease any segregation period to only 30 days, Estrada says he’s questioned if that’s the right number. “Department of Corrections’ job is extremely difficult,” Estrada said. “(They) only have two really effective tools: to deter or encourage.” Inmates can either be offered “good time” for good behavior, education or work, which shortens their sentence, or they can receive punitive measures.<u></u><u></u>

“The biggest problem is inmate-on-inmate violence,” Estrada said, adding that for some inmates, particularly those serving a life sentence, the only way to prevent this violence is through segregation.<u></u><u></u>

Ventura agrees that safety is of the highest priority inside. He says that “closed confinement” and “administrative confinement” are not punitive measures — as opposed to solitary confinement — but measures to keep the population and staff safe. Inmates in administrative confinement are reviewed at a frequency of no more than 90 days, Perez wrote.<u></u><u></u>

According to Ventura, R.I. uses a “step down” system, which means that inmates in disciplinary confinement go in front of a board every 30 to 60 days to review why they are in segregation and whether their behavior has changed, so they can return to the rest of the population.<u></u><u></u>

The placement of prisoners in disciplinary confinement can be reviewed whenever the staff suggests it, or the inmates can request a review after 45 days, Perez wrote. Their time in disciplinary confinement may be suspended if behavioral changes are shown.<u></u><u></u>

“I don’t know enough about the Rhode Island program, but I think a step down program, which is relatively short, which really gives people incentives to move out of solitary, is a good thing,” Lobel told The Herald. “Some step down programs are good and some are just continuing to warehouse people.”<u></u><u></u>

Rhode Island’s disciplinary confinement cannot be deemed “solitary,” according to Ventura. “The notion of solitary confinement presents a picture of no human contact,” Ventura said. “Even the most egregious of offenders … a person that will throw feces … or attack an officer, even those people have contact with officers and counselors,” he said.<u></u><u></u>

Inmates who experience serious mental health issues are evaluated by mental health staff and placed in the Residential Treatment Unit if they receive disciplines or show recurring misbehavior, Perez wrote. They are not placed in disciplinary or administrative confinement.
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Solitary Confinement in the United States</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Outside of R.I., Lobel has battled against the use of solitary confinement, including the Pelican Bay State Prison class action lawsuit. Lobel sought to change the California prison’s solitary confinement practices in their “Security Housing Unit,” Lobel explained at a talk hosted by the Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights and Brown’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union March 8.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cells in Pelican Bay’s SHU were 80 square feet, “twice as big as the average American walk in closet.” Inmates in the SHU were allowed one half-hour exercise period each day, with no equipment. There were no programming or religious ceremonies for prisoners. Family visits were done through glass barriers. The prison’s location on the California-Oregon border was isolating and prevented many families from visiting altogether, Lobel said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many of those in the SHU were linked to or associated with prison gangs. “California considered gangs to be as evil as … terrorists,” Lobel said. To leave the SHU, Lobel said inmates had to get parole, die or become informants. Often, informants were kept in similarly isolated situations; Lobel described the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>situation as a “Catch 22.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When I think about how long I could last in (solitary confinement), I would give myself a couple of weeks, maybe a month — not ten years, as hundreds of people were subjected to,” Lobel said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Making the argument that “people have a basic need for human interaction,” Lobel and his colleagues asserted that the deprivation of basic rights in the SHU constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Two hunger strikes and years of litigation led to a settlement that “removed virtually everyone” from that kind of solitary confinement, Lobel said. He credits the sweeping victory to several previous lawsuits.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both before the Pelican Bay Case and ever since, Lobel says his own struggle against violations of civil liberties and human rights has often involved losses. “One of my claims to fame is that I’ve sued every President (since Reagan) up until the current one — who I’m itching to sue,” Lobel said, adding that even among those cases, a win does not always culminate in action.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“As I speak here today, there are 100,000 individuals in solitary confinement,” in the United States, Lobel said. He is currently working in Pennsylvania to change rules and regulation there. Ohio and New York have already passed solitary confinement laws, but it is still a major issue in the United States, Lobel added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>City Hall exhibit brings Irish art to Providence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Gallery at City Hall unveiled its newest pieces from Irish artist Siobhan Cox-Carlos March 15. Cox-Carlos’ exhibit, “‘GLÁS’ (GREEN): A Contemporary View of the Emerald Isle,” is free and open to the public until May 12. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cox-Carlos’ interest in art began 30 years ago, and her enthusiasm prompted her to eventually return to school. “I got a degree in 2004 from the Limerick (School) of Art and Design. I’ve been painting ever since,” Cox-Carlos said. The 20 piece exhibit, which is located on the second floor of Providence City Hall, ranges from Irish landscapes to abstracts. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Landscapes make up a majority of the pieces on display. “It started in Alaska, and I was just so taken by one particular … house on props going into the water,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cox-Carlos’ paintings made their way to City Hall due to the collective efforts of the Department of Art, Culture and Tourism and the Ireland West International Trade Centre. Some of Cox-Carlos’ pieces had been displayed in the Trade Centre’s offices in Providence, but “this is the first time (these pieces) have been brought out into a public space,” Cox-Carlos said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Micah Salkind ’06 PhD’16, special projects manager for the Department of Art, Culture and Tourism, curated the exhibit with help from the Trade Centre. “It’s really important that artists are flexible when they’re working the gallery in City Hall because the space is kind of complex,” he said. “(Cox-Carlos) was a perfect artist for the gallery because her work really pops off the walls … we thought it would be great to have the opening in conjunction with St. Patrick’s Day,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This is not the first time an international artist has been featured at City Hall. The Department of Art, Culture and Tourism worked with the Trade Centre last year to bring in another artist, Yvonne King. “One of the things we’ve talked about with (Cox-Carlos) and folks at the Trade Centre is how we can do more exchanges so that artists from Providence are also going to Ireland to do either artist residencies or to do shows. This is the beginning of a longer conversation,” Salkind said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mayor Jorge Elorza expressed his gratitude for Cox-Carlos’ contribution to the space at the opening of the exhibit and presented her with a special citation from the city recognizing her work. Like Salkind, Elorza also recognized the Ireland Trade Centre for its contributions, and praised the Department of Art, Culture and Tourism for its commitment to international cooperation. “We brand ourselves as the creative capital … We use every space available to do that. With hundreds and thousands of people coming through these halls every single day, we want them to be exposed to it. What better way to do that than to celebrate the arts?” Elorza said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elorza also elaborated on the Department of Art, Culture and Tourism’s future plans for Providence’s arts scene. “We’re constantly looking to expand and do things bigger and better. The biggest splash that we’ve made over the past couple of years is with PVDFest. … We’re always looking for ways to improve it,” Elorza said. He expressed his desire to turn the annual arts fixture PVDFest into an event like SXSW in Austin, Texas. “We can also make it a driver for economic activity that draws even more attention to Providence and the region,” Elorza added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>Updated Mach 28, 2018 at 9:10 p.m.</strong></em>
<p class="p3">Providence drivers have paid over $735,000 for traffic violations since the City installed five portable camera units around school zones Jan. 16, according to Billy Kepner, press secretary for the Providence City Council. The amount paid to the City from the over 16,600 violations already exceeds the projected net revenue of $500,000 for the camera units for fiscal year 2018, Victor Morente, press secretary for the Mayor’s Office, said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Each camera is installed within a quarter mile of a school, and vehicles traveling more than 10 miles per hour over the speed limit automatically receive violations, according to a City press release. Fifteen cameras will eventually be installed. Violations are reviewed by both the Providence Police Department and Conduent, a private company which operates and manages the cameras. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An additional six cameras were activated March 5, Morente said. After two weeks of facing only warnings for speeding in those locations, speeding drivers are now receiving violations, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4">All camera violations result in $95 fines to the owner of the vehicle, Morente said. Signs are posted in each location to warn drivers that the cameras are in place, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">State Rep. Bob Craven, D-North Kingstown, originally introduced the legislation requiring speed cameras within a quarter mile of schools. While the House voted overwhelmingly to pass the bill in 2016, Craven now has second thoughts about the heavy fines for initial violations, Craven wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">On March 14, Craven introduced a bill to amend the original law to only issue warnings for a first offense and a $50 fine for the second offense. After the third violation, drivers would begin to receive the $95 fine.</p>
<p class="p4">The thousands of tickets issued and hundreds of thousands of dollars the cameras have raised so far have proved exorbitant, Craven wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">Craven initially hoped that the bill would reduce traffic while lowering city costs by not requiring police officers on the scene, he wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">“Safety comes first, but safety can be achieved by using the cameras and better signage to create a ‘chilling effect’ on speeder’s behavior,” Craven added.</p>
<p class="p4">State Rep. Anthony Giarrusso, R-East Greenwich, introduced a bill to ban speed cameras from the state. Giarrusso said that the camera units are a “government cash grab” by the City, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p class="p4">“I stand by my statement that this is more about revenue than school safety,” Giarrusso wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="m_-925134963405386341m_-8383592578962492673gmail-p4">“Look no further than the days and hours of operation, the dollar amount of the fine and that there is no penalty to the driver but only the registered owner of the vehicle,” Giarrusso wrote. The cameras operate between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, according to a R.I. General Assembly press release.</p>
<p class="m_-925134963405386341m_-8383592578962492673gmail-p4">A connection between Mayor Jorge Elorza and a Conduent lobbyist raised further questions about the traffic cameras.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Elorza’s former chief of staff Tony Simon now serves as a “$5,000 a month lobbyist for Conduent at the Rhode Island State House,” GoLocalProv.com <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/news/elorzas-former-chief-of-staff-is-5000-a-month-lobbyist-for-traffic-camera-c">reported</a>. Conduent earns $2,978 per month for each camera and $7.50 for every violation it processes, WPRI <a href="http://wpri.com/2018/03/07/providence-hits-17000-speed-camera-violations/">reported</a>. However, the City has continued to stand by the value of the speed cameras in maintaining public safety.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“While the City remains committed to the cameras as a way to keep our kids safe, the City is open to reasonable changes to the state law,” Morente wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">Mayor Jorge Elorza and Public Safety Commissioner Stephen Paré initially lauded the program for its ability to protect school zones from reckless drivers.</p>
<p class="p4">“Ultimately this is about keeping families safe, especially in areas with many children around,” Elorza said in a press release announcing the cameras. “Tragedies can be prevented with innovative solutions and that’s exactly what these cameras do.”</p>
<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that State Rep. Anthony Giarrusso noted the connection between a Conduent lobbyist and the Elorza administration. In fact, Giarusso did not state that there was a connection between a Conduent lobbyist and the Elorza administration. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A bill that would require Uber, Lyft and taxi drivers to undergo a national background check before being allowed to work in the state went before the Rhode Island State Legislature’s House Committee on Corporations Tuesday night.</p>
<p class="p2">Assistant Attorney General Joee Lindbeck, who spoke for the bill in front of the committee, feels that current background checks for the transportation services are inadequate.</p>
<p class="p2">Uber’s background check policies state that, in order to become a driver, a person may not have “a conviction for a felony, violent crime or sexual offense within the last seven years, among other things such as a registration on the U.S. Department of Justice National Sex Offender Public website.” Uber’s website also says that the company uses the background check company Checkr, which is “accredited by the National Association of Professional Background Screeners.” But Lindbeck believes these third party background checks are not thorough enough to ensure rider safety.</p>
<p class="p2">“We think actually (that the background checks) may be illusory because your statute says they can only go back seven years,” Lindbeck said, adding that, for example, someone convicted 10 years ago of a first degree robbery and released recently would pass a private background check. “We think that’s very scary, especially when we have many colleges campuses in the neighborhood,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">Legal processes in other states have shown the inadequacy of private background checks, Lindbeck added. Once Massachusetts passed a 2017 law requiring state background checks for transportation network company operators, such as Uber and Lyft drivers, the state discovered that 11 percent of the state’s Uber drivers had “disqualifying information” on their records, including incidents of sexual abuse and exploitation. Additionally, California missed about 30,000 registered sex offenders in the third-party background checks, she said.</p>
<p class="p2">If the bill were to pass, drivers in the state would be required to undergonational background checks completed through the FBI prior to their employment. Convictions, not arrests, revealed on the national background check could affect a person’s ability to obtain a permit or license to drive in the state.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thomas Kogut, associate administrator at the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, also spoke in favor of the bill at the House hearing. Neither Uber nor Lyft elected to present spoken testimony at Tuesday’s hearing.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The Senate Judiciary Committee heard the bill Feb. 13 and held it “for further study,” according to the R.I. Legislative Status <a href="http://status.rilin.state.ri.us">Report</a>. During the state Senate hearing, Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, expressed concern that requiring national background checks would prevent individuals who “had turned their lives around” from working and supporting their families. In response, Lindbeck said that the law would allow TNCs or taxi companies to have the discretion to keep the person employed. If the law passes, an individual would not be able to obtain a Hackney Operator’s License, necessary for taxi drivers, or transportation network operator permit, which applies to Uber and Lyft drivers, without the in-depth background check.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The American Civil Liberties Union expressed opposition to this legislation with written and spoken testimony at the Senate hearing. According to Steve Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island ACLU chapter, the expansion of background checks hurts ex-offenders. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The House committee recommended the bill be held for further study.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">As digitalization makes information increasingly accessible, the field of journalism has evolved to survive. U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., voiced his support for the news and media industry when he introduced the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act March 7. The act would exempt newspaper publishers from antitrust laws, which would allow them to collectively negotiate with tech giants such as Google and Facebook, according to a press release from Cicilline’s <a href="https://cicilline.house.gov/press-release/cicilline-introduces-journalism-competition-and-preservation-act">office</a>. As the leading Democrat on the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, Cicilline acknowledged the undermining effect that antitrust laws have on newspapers. In order to preserve competition, the laws prevent businesses from forming alliances; however, the uneven power dynamic between newspapers and tech giants leaves news organizations without substantial negotiating power. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This bill empowers local newspapers to negotiate collectively with the biggest technology platforms to ensure consumers have access to the best journalism possible,” Cicilline said in the press statement. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The act was backed by publications nationwide and received resounding support from the News Media Alliance, a trade association that represents approximately 2,000 news media outlets across the country. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We act as a watchdog to ensure that … those with power are held accountable so that the masses are educated and we can continue to have a healthy democracy,” said Vice President of Government Affairs at News Media Alliance, Danielle Coffey.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The debate surrounding the relationship between tech platforms and the news industry is especially pertinent given recent anxieties about fake news. As more people access news through channels like Facebook and Google, the News Media Alliance has become distanced from its readers and lost some control over how content is delivered, Coffey said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“More people come to news sites through side doors, such as a Google search or Facebook newsfeed, than go to the (newspaper) home page, look through, and decide what they want to read,” said Rick Edmonds, a media and business analyst at the Poynter Institute, a non-profit journalism school in St. Petersburg, Florida. The changing nature of journalism has created a revenue problem for the field, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Coffey, 75 percent of referral traffic for the News Media Alliance comes from Google and Facebook. With this dominant source, the association must work with its tech partners to help meet its members’ funding needs, she added. Digital ad spending and subscriptions are two significant sources of revenue for many publishers. Coffey asserted that laws such as the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act would ensure that quality journalism is rewarded monetarily, which is necessary to sustain accurate and accessible news.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jonathan Readey, senior lecturer in English and co-director of the Nonfiction Writing Program, agrees that substantial funding for news outlets is necessary to ensure journalism is equipped to serve the public. It is “important to have adequate compensation, so that people will be motivated to do the stories and coverage that are necessary for a functioning society,” Readey said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tech companies are also working to preserve high-quality media outlets. At a press briefing in New York March 20, Google announced its intentions to pledge $300 million to “strengthen quality<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/money/2018/03/20/media/google-news-initiative/index.html"> journalism.”</a> The Google News Initiative would make it easier for Google users to subscribe to news sites by allowing them to transfer billing information already on file with Google. This development would help facilitate the necessary funding for journalists, Coffey said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Google News Initiative would also set up several projects to combat “fake news,” such as MediaWise, a partnership with Poynter, Stanford University and the Local Media Association to develop a digital literacy curriculum, CNN reported.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Coffey expressed her optimism for the future and hope that the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act will pass. It would “give high quality, trustworthy sources the ability to thrive, and I think that that would be a very concrete, real world impact that everybody would benefit from,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Edmonds said that while the bill would provide a significant benefit to journalists, he is doubtful that it will pass. “We’re talking about something introduced by a Democrat when those in charge … are not very wild about the press,” Edmonds said. “So, it’s probably an uphill climb.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, Edmond, Coffey and Readey all expressed their belief that while technology has created new challenges for the journalism industry, the field will remain relevant.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I certainly feel like it’s just the beginning for journalism,” Readey said. “In many ways, it’s a growing frontier, and it’s necessary to lay down policies that will continue to ensure the free and correct flow of information.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the voices of young students rang across the Rhode Island State House lawn on Saturday, a crowd comprised people of all ages gathered to listen and respond. The Rhode Island politicians who spoke kept their statements brief, seeking to center the student activists in a gun control movement that has been led by young people — particularly the group of teens that mobilized following the shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Feb. 14.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“My generation has had enough,” said Victoria Richard, a ninth grader from Smithfield, Rhode Island. “Enough of thoughts and prayers and no change. Enough of children my age being shot in school.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today feels different,” said Gov. Gina Raimondo. “And why does it feel different? Because of you.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The protest — organized by Sophia Capalbo, a senior at Johnson and Wales University, and attended by an estimated 3,000 people, according to police — was one of more than 800 “March for Our Lives” protests held in cities around the world. </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/march-for-our-lives-huge-crowds-gather-for-rally-against-gun-violence-in-nations-capital/2018/03/24/4121b100-2f7d-11e8-b0b0-f706877db618_story.html?utm_term=.2fe6f0ef9d6b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Washington, D.C.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hundreds of thousands turned out to stand behind the survivors of the Parkland shooting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Rhode Island, student speakers from the Rhode Island School of Design and local high schools called on legislators to enact stricter gun control laws, and to limit the sway of money from lobbyists like the National Rifle Association over Congress. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Indifference should not be the only element that is holding these United States together,” said Tyler Alexander, a junior at Coventry High School.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers echoed the students concerns.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Remember that the NRA would not have the power that it does in Congress if it were not for the power of money in Congress,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. to the crowd. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until we change Congress, we’re not going to change the gun laws in this country,” said Rep. David Cicilline ’83, D-R.I., while addressing the crowd. He was met with cheers of “Vote them out.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Cicilline introduced a bill to ban assault weapons, </span><a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/375659-dems-introduce-assault-weapons-ban"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported. And on Friday, the Justice Department ruled to ban bump stocks, a gun accessory that can accelerate the firing of semiautomatic weapons.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is not too much to ask for universal background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands. It is not too much to pass an assault weapons ban,” said Rep. Jim Langevin, D-RI, who was badly injured as a child in a gun accident that left him paralyzed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitehouse urged voters to carry the momentum from the protest forward into the November midterm elections. “Remember why you are here today and remember how you feel today through November,” he said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the students present participated in a nationwide 17-minute student walkout March 14.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanessa Thompson and Jackie Emby, both 15, said that they were disappointed by their school’s walkout and hoped that the State House rally would jumpstart more meaningful action. At their high school in North Kingstown, a student rally for gun control turned into a </span><a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/20180321/letter-tate-kent-north-kingstown-walkout-was-exercise-in-futility"><span style="font-weight: 400;">memorial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> service for the 17 victims of Parkland, a shift Emby and Thompson said was spurred by the school’s administration in the hopes of making the protest less political.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was kind of embarrassing,” Thompson said. “You want to make a change, but you can’t do anything.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Emby and Thompson’s voices were heard. Though they were in fifth grade at the time of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, their lives have constantly been shaped by the fear of gun violence. “It’s something that you think about and plan in your head when you’re little,” Emby said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Columbine High School Shooting in 1999, the United States has seen an average of 10 school shootings per year, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/us-school-shootings-history/?utm_term=.f665cc3e5d9b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Judy Kain, an active member of the Rhode Island Women’s March movement, said that this moment feels special. “It builds and builds until the outrage becomes something you can no longer overlook,” she said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">She feels guilty that she didn’t do more to protest after the Sandy Hook shooting, she said.“The reason I am out and have been out is that I should have been out. I should have paid better attention,” Kain said. “With President Obama in office, it was such a moment of victory. I fooled myself.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Protesters shouted down President Donald Trump’s proposals to arm teachers with weapons. On Friday, Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that would make some improvements to background checks and provide grants to schools for gun violence prevention.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is </span><a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/380090-trump-arrives-at-florida-golf-club-as-hundreds-of-thousands-march-on"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. The White House released a statement Wednesday reaffirming Trump’s commitment to keeping children safe and applauding young Americans for exercising their first amendment rights. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the State House steps, speakers called the crowd to register to vote after the event. Speakers included Raimondo, Cicilline, Whitehouse, Mayor Jorge Elorza and State Rep. Aaron Regunberg ’12, D-Providence. Student activists spoke as well, including Alexander; Halima Ibrahim, a 10th grader at the Islamic School of Rhode Island; Nathan Cornell, a sophomore at University of Rhode Island; Nina Gregg, a sophomore at RISD and an alum of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School; Virginia Nault, a student from Fall River, Massachusetts; and Capalbo.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Soon it’s going to be us calling the shots and there will be no more shot,” Alexander said.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Leah Vernon started her blog, “Beauty and the Muse,” in 2013 because every time she looked at a beauty magazine all she saw were tall and thin white women.</p>
<p class="p2">“I wanted to be that so bad,” Vernon told The Herald. “I (had) eating disorders and I hated my Muslimness and my blackness and my plus-size body because I couldn’t ever attain that look, … (that) societal way of seeing beauty.”</p>
<p class="p2">Vernon spoke Monday evening at the Providence Public Library about the power of positively expressing her identity as a woman of color who wears a hijab.</p>
<p class="p2">The conversation, moderated by the PPL’s Programs and Exhibitions Director Christina Bevilacqua, accompanied the library’s “HairBrained” series, a four-month-long exhibit that began in March. The exhibit and lineup of speakers feature items related to hairstyle from the library’s collections. According to Kate Wells, a PPL curator, the library hopes to explore the way that hair is treated politically to both oppress and empower individuals.</p>
<p class="p2">“The goal is to create a conversation of acceptance with how people choose to wear their hair, whether visibly or covered,” Wells said. “Hopefully, people gain awareness for why people might cover (their hair) and allow them to express themselves in different ways.”</p>
<p class="p2">In her talk, Vernon spoke about consciously attempting to subvert the superficial and false aura of perfection that many beauty bloggers project on social media. When she first began to blog in 2013, Vernon said she tried to mimic these more conventional bloggers, though she occasionally opened up about her life — her insecurities, frustrations and struggles with mental health.</p>
<p class="p2">Every time she did, she said her inbox quickly filled with messages fromwomen across the world who shared their stories and told her how inspiring it was to see these sensitive topics discussed publicly. At first reluctant to publish details about her private life online, Vernon said she eventually decided to embrace openness wholeheartedly because she felt people needed to hear her voice and see her for who she is. She became, in her own words, “the rawest of the raw” on the internet.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’m fat and I’m fabulous and I’m a sister and I’m educated and I want to put out that and not this perfect Instagram thing,” Vernon said.</p>
<p class="p2">While Vernon has been writing constantly since the age of six, she worried that no one on the New York Times bestseller list looked like her. Though she feared there would never be space for her in the writing world, she continued writing and went on to complete an MFA program at Wilkes University.</p>
<p class="p2">“Six years ago when we started working together she was definitely Leah, who she is, but was in a different place in her life,” said Taylor Polites, her former professor at Wilkes who now serves as a practitioner in residence at the Swearer Center. “Today, to think of all the building she’s done on her career and her platform, the audience that she has created for herself, it’s incredible for me to see her create that out of her own passion and determination.”</p>
<p class="p2">Vernon’s unapologetic rawness and fashion sense have earned her tens of thousands of followers across social media and widespread visibility. Recently, Lululemon Athletica offered her the chance to speak on a sponsored panel for International Women’s Day. Vernon told the library audience that she wavered at the thought of working with a company that seemed to cater to fit and light-skinned women.</p>
<p class="p2">“Lululemon doesn’t make clothes that fit me,” Vernon said. “But I wanted people to see my face there. Hopefully my presence being there and collaborating with them would help them to start using models who are larger and browner.”</p>
<p class="p2">Vernon closed out the evening answering questions from the audience about her tastes (she loves NPR) and the financial challenges she faces as a blogger, all the while continuing to emphasize her desire to transform beauty standards.</p>
<p class="p2">“I want to show people that beauty comes in all forms and to inspire people to be the best version of themselves,” Vernon told The Herald. “You don’t have to be what society tells you you have to be to feel valued or important or beautiful — I want people to feel like their voice and their body are worthy.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brown alum to fight domestic violence at national level</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/08/brown-alum-fight-domestic-violence-national-level/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The National Network to End Domestic Violence has hired Deborah DeBare ’83 as its new senior deputy director. She has served as the executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence for 23 years. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">DeBare began helping domestic violence survivors as a senior at the University through Sojourner House, a nonprofit that supports those who have experienced domestic and sexual abuse. While volunteering, DeBare worked with survivors to figure out the safest, most promising path forward. When she was a student, she joined the political action group FIRE, which raised awareness about violence against women. As part of FIRE, her work included informing the public about rape allegations against former Providence mayor Buddy Cianci, for which he was never prosecuted. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Confidentiality was key in FIRE’s Cianci campaign, as among other initiatives.“We printed off these very official looking signs and posted them all over the city that said ‘Curfew has been implemented in the city of Providence, no women are allowed out after 9 p.m. It is not safe to walk the streets with an alleged rapist as mayor,’” DeBare said. “We were very much a stealth group, we kept our names out because we were all afraid of getting kicked out of school.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Today, DeBare continues to fight against the pervasiveness of domestic violence nationwide, which has not significantly improved since her time at the University.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We haven’t really seen the prevalence rates drop,” DeBare said. “We still see research that shows one in four women will experience intimate partner violence at some point in her life.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To combat this reality, DeBare has slowly but surely expanded efforts to prevent domestic violence from spreading. For example, RICADV was involved in the implementation of neighborhood cookouts and movie nights in Newport to build “community cohesion” because a stronger community, in theory, means neighbors are more likely to take action upon hearing about domestic violence in nearby households, DeBare said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">DeBare has also focused on maintaining the emergency and support services offered by RICADV’s five member organizations, which include Sojourner House and Blackstone Valley Advocacy Group.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In her new position at NNEDV, which will expand her reach from Rhode Island to the nation, DeBare will be working with different state coalitions against domestic violence to capitalize on the strengths and overcome the weaknesses of each state’s program. For example, DeBare praised the state of Kansas for having a unified message that combines sexual assault and domestic violence prevention; but she also stressed that the rural nature of Kansas makes communication between the state’s programs difficult.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">DeBare brings experience in building functional coalitions to address program weaknesses in states like Kansas. Under her leadership, RICADV grew from three to 12 staff members, while staying financially stable.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“I’m really proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish in Rhode Island,” said Jennifer Meade, president of the RICADV board of directors. “I think other coalitions across the country are going to be able to learn from that.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Meade and Linda Impagliazzo, executive director of Blackstone Valley Advocacy Center, agreed that DeBare’s success as a leader of the RICADV came from her commitment to helping victims of domestic violence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“If there’s ever times when she gets approached and someone says, ‘Well, have you thought about doing this,’ she will go back and say … ‘Is this part of what we have purposely set out to do?’” Meade said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Impagliazzo believ</span><span class="s3">es DeBare’s success can also be attributed to her ability to meet each agency’s needs in a fair way, while always putting victims of domestic violence first.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">DeBare sees working at NNEDV as the next step toward shifting national values to create a more equitable and just world for women — a process that has been slower than she anticipated while at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“My goal is to see the next generation of kids — boys and girls — growing up where they have a sense of expectation … that their relationship will be healthy and supportive,” DeBare said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A documentary screened as part of the first annual Rhode Island Black Film Festival yesterday sparked conversation about the reconstruction of a house in which Rosa Parks once lived that is currently located in Providence. The film, entitled “The White House” and directed by Fabia Mendoza, focuses on a personal artistic endeavor led by Fabia Mendoza’s husband Ryan Mendoza.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The house featured in the film belonged to Parks’ brother and first caught the attention of Ryan Mendoza in 2016 in Detroit. After he deconstructed the house and rebuilt it in Berlin to save it from demolition, the University offered to bring the house to Providence in February 2018 to feature the life and times of Rosa Parks at the WaterFire Arts Center. But upon the house’s arrival in March, the University canceled its support by citing the house as an object of an outside dispute, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/15/rosa-parks-exhibition-canceled/">previously reported</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Upon cancellation of the exhibition, we had a contractual obligation to the artist and to WaterFire to disassemble and remove the house from the current space, return it to the artist’s care or arrange for shipping at Brown’s expense to any location in the U.S. or Germany as determined by the artist,” wrote Director of News and Editorial Development Brian Clark in an email to The Herald. “We agreed to provide funding at a level aligned with that commitment and at this point, we have no remaining obligations related to the house.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Without financial support, the house cannot be displayed to the public in a full exhibition, said Barnaby Evans, director of the WaterFire Arts Center.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“My question now is I really want to see this house,” said an attendee, Christine Rosa. “I want to see it now. I live here in Providence, I pay my taxes and I think it’s my right to see it. Why can’t I see the house now, please?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In response, Evans offered to show Rosa the exhibit, but it remains unopen to the public, Evans said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since the University has rescinded its financial support for displaying the house, the WaterFire Arts Center is now constrained by “a big gap in funding” if they decide to go forward with the exhibition, Evans said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “There’s no lights on it, there’s no installation,” he added. “We don’t have personnel to open the museum.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The post-film discussion also featured stories from audience members about a weekend when Rosa Parks came to Providence in 1984. This time alloted for questions evolved into a conversation about race, inequality and need in Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s the first black (film) festival in Rhode Island, so we’re really a part of history,” said audience member Noe Staley. “It’s important for black filmmakers to share their talents and voice their opinions.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Festival founder Ann Clanton said she intended for discussion about social and racial issues to take place at her screenings. She also is proud to feature underrepresented artists — a decision appreciated by the audience members present at the event. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though Fabia Mendoza is not black, she said she is grateful that her film was screened at RIBFF.“I’m not black, obviously, and I was just at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, but this means much more to me,” she said. “Because my movie was screened in several places, and I also see segregation in the audience a lot, and I would like to have a reaction from people who feel strongly about this thing.”</span></p>
<em><strong>Corrections: An earlier version of this article stated that the documentary directed by Fabia Mendoza is entitled <span class="s3">“A White House.” In fact, the documentary is entitled “The White House." An earlier version of this article also stated that the film was a personal artistic endeavor led by Fabia Mendoza’s husband Ryan Mendoza. In fact, the film focused on a personal artistic endeavor led by Fabia Mendoza’s husband Ryan Mendoza. The Herald regrets the errors. </span></strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Providence looks to develop automated public transit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In a new pilot program, Providence plans to use automated vehicle technology to fill gaps in the city’s public transportation. The program — The Transportation Innovation Partnership — looks to connect downtown Providence to the Woonasquatucket River Corridor. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation will begin the search for vendors later this spring, said Chief Public Affairs Officer at Rhode Island Department of Transportation Charles St. Martin.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The autonomous vehicle is a new self-driving technology employed by over 45 cities around the world, according to a report by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Aspen Institute. Municipalities have introduced the technology as a safer, more efficient alternative to human drivers. Cambridge, Massachusetts, unanimously voted to begin autonomous vehicle testing in early April — joining the list of cities utilizing various applications of the technology, which range from automated taxis to trains.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The RIDOT hopes that implementing a pilot program will help the city “plan properly for the future,” Martin said. The Woonasquatucket River Corridor will serve as the RIDOT’s place of testing because there is <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Planning-OSV_AppxC_DevlmntMap_HiRes.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1523833396418000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFbGb9w5ueJGJ9_8YM1vJfaYluoQ">not currently a transit service</a> that links the Olneyville and Valley neighborhoods. The two neighborhoods were once a manufacturing hot spot in the 18th century and have since become a “flourishing Arts and Innovation district,” according the program’s <a href="http://www.dot.ri.gov/projects/trip/docs/TRIP_Mobility_Challenge.pdf">proposal</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The plan to use AV technology in Providence progressed at RIDOT’s international mini summit last April, which brought together experts from across the world to discuss the application of AV in their respective countries. The Transportation Innovation Partnership then organized an exposition with groups ranging from consultants to mobility firms in September 2017 to continue the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When you’re planning your work 10 years out, not only do you have to look at today’s technologies and what’s available to us now, … but you also have to look at what is coming down the line that will have a significant impact on how we operate and how we do work” said RIDOT Program Development Assistant Director Christos Xenophontos, adding that AV could have some productivity benefits but its impact still remains a “large unknown.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Xenophontos said he anticipates that the AV pilot program could “disrupt (the) existing workforce,” but also “create a lot of opportunities for new employment.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Computer Science Michael Littman said he is shocked by how supportive the government has been to AV technology, adding that he initially expected the AV industry to have to “jump through regulatory hoops.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If (AV technology) really works, it will save lives,” Littman said. “These machines don’t get bored. They don’t get distracted. They don’t have to check their email.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Although safety is a motivating factor in the move toward automated vehicles, there are still safety concerns with the current AV technology, Littman said. Recently, an Uber driver with a automated car struck and killed a pedestrian in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/19/uber-self-driving-car-kills-woman-arizona-tempe">Arizona</a>, and a driver was killed when his Tesla crashed into a highway barrier in <a href="https://www.livescience.com/62292-tesla-model-x-crash-statement.html">California</a> while in auto-driving mode.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Economics Matthew Turner said AV technology will “increase the capacity of the road network” and transform “the way that people use their cars.” If AV becomes more widespread and reduces the cost of travel, we should expect more driving “up to the point that roads are congested,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The TRIP initiative, according to Xenophontos, is looking more toward a “transit-oriented solution” that will complement the already existing RIPTA system.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The request for proposal process is expected to begin later this spring and will allow industries to propose their own creative solutions, Martin said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “We took extreme pains to write the (request for proposal) in a way that is open to encourage as much competition as possible because we want to encourage vendors that could have an innovative solution that we might not have necessarily thought of to come forward and propose it,” Xenophontos said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">RIDOT plans to begin implementing ideas chosen from vendors’ applications as early as this fall, Martin said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Community members voice opinions on proposed reproductive health bills</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The State Judiciary Committee’s hearing on reproductive rights yesterday covered legislation that drew hundreds of community members to the State House, from high school students to baby boomers. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After beginning over an hour late, six bills related to reproductive rights were introduced for simultaneous consideration and commentary. The first five measures proposed limitations on women’s rights — “Recognizing the fetus as a human life upon the existence of a heartbeat,” “The Rhode Island unborn child protection from dismemberment abortion act,” two “Acts relating to criminal offenses - children” and “An act relating to health and safety - Born-alive infant protection act.” The sixth bill, the Reproductive Health Care Act, would replace outdated existing laws and safeguard the right to abortion at the state level.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Advocates demonstrating about reproductive rights represented diametrically opposed perspectives, which they defended with respectful conviction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m here to support the bill for reproductive rights, and I’m here because I believe the right to abortion is a fundamental part of women’s health care, a basic right that women all over America need to have, and all over the world need to have,” said Rebecca Atwood of Providence. “I want Rhode Island state law to reflect what the federal law is,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Joshua Santos, a sophomore at Providence College from Pawtucket, came to support his “pro-life” stance. He described his position as a matter of “human dignity,” explaining that “everyone should have the right to life.” He was also “hoping” to have some conversations with people from across the political aisle.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Women’s health care is about having women decide for themselves, not someone else decide for them, because it’s been too long (that) people keep telling us what to do. And our body is our body,” said Aneice Germain of Cranston. She described threats to reproductive rights as hitting “minorities” especially hard.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jocelyn Foye, co-creator of The Woman Project, a nonprofit that supports feminist art activism, said socioeconomic considerations factor into the abortion debate. When abortion is not allowed, women can be locked into a state of “extreme poverty,” she added. “We’re not looking to change people’s opinions of what is right; we’re not doing anything like that,” she said. Rather than thinking of abortion as the termination of a human life, “we’re actually very interested in making sure that women have bodily freedom,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the other hand, Loren Duhamel attended the rally because she “believe(s) in life; God created each one of us, and he’s the only one who has the right to take it, not each one of us, she said.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After the bills were introduced, the Committee opened the floor to community members who were for or against the bill. These community members debated whether the Reproductive Health Care Act was redundant in the context of Roe v. Wade, and the likelihood of the federal decision’s appeal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The proposed bill shares the ‘fetus-counts-for-nothing’ view of the abortion industry. It institutes a laissez-faire policy with respect to the termination of human life,” said Dwight Duncan, professor at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Access to reproductive health care is under attack in this country like never before,” said Sulina Mohanty of the North Kingstown Democrats. “There are laws on the books right now that don’t respect women’s essential rights, and that don’t respect the values that the vast majority of Rhode Islanders want to be protected,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After several hours of continued testaments in favor and against the legislation in question, the bills were not held to a vote and are instead being “held for further study,” according to WPRI.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Nearly two months after establishing a hotline that provides support to immigrants and minorities in Rhode Island, the Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance is focused on making small-scale community change by offering immediate support to its callers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Galvanized to collaborate by the election of President Trump, six local advocacy groups formed AMOR after a year’s worth of planning — Direct Action for Rights and Equality, the Providence Youth Student Movement, Fighting Against Natural Gas, Call Off Your Tired Old Ethics, Colectivo Sin Fronteras and Refugee Dream Center. Some of these organizations had previously collaborated to advocate for the rights of people of color, which made working together to conceptualize AMOR easier, said Catarina Lorenzo, the overseeing organizer of AMOR.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">AMOR offers support in English and Spanish and includes a two-part legal support team, with one specializing in immigration services and another in police violence. In addition, AMOR provides mental health care. The organization relies on two staff members and a network of around 60 volunteers to provide these resources to Rhode Island residents.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As of mid-March, the AMOR hotline had received approximately 10 calls, Lorenzo said, from people primarily seeking legal support for immigration issues. AMOR was created as a hotline with the priority of “stopping deportations and preventing deportations,” said Sophia Wright, a community organizer for DARE and organizer for AMOR, adding that it was intended to “be as a first line of defense, so we could have rapid response happening.” The hotline allows organizers to “come to the scene of the hurt as soon as possible, so that healing can happen,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Island has seen an increase in the detention of immigrants, Wright said. Her work with immigration organizing in Rhode Island — which extends beyond AMOR — and discussions with lawyers who collaborate with AMOR have shown her that “the shift has been happening since January towards detaining people in Rhode Island at a quicker rate for very minor things” that would not have faced the same consequences under the Obama administration. Examples include “courthouse pickups,” she said, pointing out that under the previous administration, immigrants would be picked up if they had committed a crime or had a pending order of deportation. “And now, what they’re doing is they’re picking up anybody who they find,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Basically, they’re picking up the low-hanging fruit: people who are not a threat to society, so that they can up their statistics to demonstrate that they are ‘taking out the riffraff.’ But essentially, what they are doing is taking out the most vulnerable: people going to routine immigration meetings, hearings, things to update their status,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even before the establishment of the hotline, AMOR circulated a petition in support of Lilian Calderon, an immigrant who was detained despite her lack of a criminal record,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>according to Uprise RI. “We did great; our community raised $10,000 in six days,” said Bella Robinson, executive director of Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics. Calderon and her husband were present for AMOR’s launch Feb. 14, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mayor Jorge Elorza issued a statement while Calderon was under threat of deportation, according to <a href="https://upriseri.com/news/immigration/2018-02-08-elorza-calderon/">Uprise RI</a>. “The case of Lilian Calderon, who has been here since she was three years old, who grew up in our city and who graduated from our public schools is a sad reminder of how wrongheaded our immigration policy is,” the statement read.</span></p>
<p class="p4">In addition to immediate and direct legal support, mental health services are crucial components, Wright said. “Because they’re experiencing that trauma, (people who need legal support) will also be needing mental health support — especially if somebody has been detained already,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “Having a mental health provider provide an assessment for the family is an extremely important element in a court case to prove that somebody shouldn’t be separated from their citizen children,” Wright said. “That’s been a huge reason for us to have a seriously well-equipped mental health network to actually support the legal process” at AMOR. This vein of resources has “definitely been effective; we have been able to link people up to counselors that can write those assessments” and submit them to court, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wright envisions that the scope of AMOR will eventually transcend immigration issues. “Hate crimes, criminalization of immigrants and criminalization of people of color” should all be discussed in the same category, Wright said. “Those things get pigeonholed in different categories,” she explained. “What AMOR has really done is unify all of those things” under an “umbrella,” which she described as issues of “white supremacy or capitalism.” “Colonialism” constitutes another unifying root of entrenched issues in this vein, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While rhetoric on capitalism and colonialism might come across as too academic, “when you fight against them in this way, it makes them very real, because you watch (the systems) play out on people’s real bodies,” Wright added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Last year, I had a serious problem at the court,” said Eva Davila, a Providence resident who was referred to AMOR by her psychologist. Lorenzo and AMOR put her in contact with an immigration lawyer as well as transportation to her court date, she added. Though Davila preferred not to elaborate on the specifics of her case, she said it was successfully resolved with AMOR’s support.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a nascent organization, AMOR is currently focused on increasing outreach and community awareness of the resources provided through the hotline. “The more outreach we’ll do in the community, the more types of calls we’ll see,” Wright said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">AMOR is pacing its expansion in order to ensure it provides effective service on a smaller scale. “Right now, AMOR is focusing on just doing our job well. We’re building systems that can be sustainable, so we don’t have a timeline for growth and expansion,” Wright said. “We want to make sure that we’re working with people.” For the time being, AMOR is planning trainings to increase the number of hotline operators and focusing on publicizing their initiatives throughout Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If 50 percent of Providence knew that we existed, could we handle the influx of calls? This is what I’m most concerned about and most interested in seeing AMOR be able to handle it realistically and sustainably,” Wright said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re never going to stop needing to support each other in this community, when we’re experiencing the abuse of the systems that are broken, so I think AMOR is something that can support us long-term.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Andrew Yang ’96 was on College Hill, his life revolved around three activities: Taekwondo, working out and playing video games. Now, Yang directs his creative energy toward a different trifecta: automation, capitalism and the future of our nation. A little over two decades after graduating from the University and founding his own company, Venture for America, Yang is running for President of the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An economics and political science concentrator, Yang used his two areas of study to develop the core tenet of his campaign — universal basic income. If elected, the 2020 Democratic candidate promises to allocate $1,000 per month to every American between the ages of 18 and 64, which he calls a “Freedom Dividend,” according to his <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/meet-andrew/">campaign website.</a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, a majority of Americans “can’t pay a $500 bill that’s unexpected, and it’s leading to a mindset of scarcity and dysfunction in much of the country,” Yang said. “A thousand dollars a month would make a dramatic difference in the day-to-day lives of tens of millions of families.” The monthly stipend could improve childcare, domestic violence rates and mental and physical health, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yang believes universal basic income can address the same sources of frustration that fueled the election of President Donald Trump: automation and job loss. “Donald Trump is our president today because we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and other states,” he said. Automation “is no longer a future-facing conversation. We are in the middle of it, and it’s tearing us apart.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the founder of Venture for America, an organization that helps entrepreneurs create jobs in cities, Yang worked to share skills suited to a 21st century environment with recent graduates. “But along the way, it became clear to me that job creation will not outpace the massive impending job loss due to automation,” reads a statement on Yang’s website. “Those days are simply over.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yang plans to develop a new tax on the companies that benefit most from automation in order to fund his universal basic <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/meet-andrew/">income proposal.</a> With this policy change, the top 1 percent would end up contributing substantially to the U.S. economy through their purchases; these contributions would exceed the $1,000 per month they would receive under his plan, Yang said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The people who benefit most from universal basic income are the people who have the least and the least access to opportunities,” he added. “Economic justice is social justice.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A concern with universal basic income is that it would drive up the cost of many consumer goods. But Yang believes that competition between firms and technology would mitigate those effects. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Further, Yang said he has plans to address costs in industries that do not adequately self-regulate, specifically health care and education. He aims to move the nation toward a single-payer <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/single-payer-healthcare/">health care system</a>, either by expanding Medicare or by creating a new health care system. To reduce the costs of higher education, Yang’s plans explore limiting the rate at which universities that receive public funding can increase their<a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/controlling-cost-higher-education/"> costs.</a> He is also considering decreasing the administrator-student ratio that is required to receive public funding.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yang’s dreams of and designs for economic justice fall under his platform dubbed “Human Capitalism,” which prioritizes human well-being and fulfillment as opposed to the gross domestic product. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If implemented, Yang believes Human Capitalism has the potential to mitigate the opioid crisis and mass shootings, among other pressing concerns. The opioid crisis is “a disease of our current form of capitalism” where drug companies prescribe billions of dollars worth of opioids and advertise them as “wonder drug(s)” that are not addictive, Yang said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Under Human Capitalism, drug companies would internalize the cost of opioid addiction — in that case, the profit incentive would align with the social one, he added. His same vein of thought applies in the case of guns. “Right now, every time there is a shooting, gun sales go up” because people are afraid the government will take away their guns, Yang said. “Imagine if a gun manufacturer had to pay a fine every time one of their guns were used in a shooting.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yang acknowledges that his goals would best materialize with a Democratic majority in Congress. If Yang wins the election, he expects to take office with a blue majority since his election would signify a “blue wave” and “an appetite and a need for big policy changes,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prominent supporters of Yang include Andy Stern, a former leader of Service Employees International Union; Tony Hsieh, chief executive of Zappos; and several venture capitalists and former employees of Facebook and Google, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/technology/his-2020-campaign-message-the-robots-are-coming.html">New York Times reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yang credits the University with inspiring his humanist and optimistic values.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Brown instilled in me a deep sense of both social responsibility and also possibility,” he said. “This confidence that I could make a difference and make great things happen if I was well-(intentioned) and committed, and willing to put my heart and soul into it.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His work with scholars and students on College Hill has extended far beyond the Taekwondo, workouts and video games that kickstarted his journey. The University has regularly hosted Venture for America’s five-week summer training, and countless alums have already stepped up to support Yang as he campaigns for the presidency.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most of all, Yang believes that students at the University are vital to the future he envisions for the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“To anyone who is at Brown right now, please know that our country needs you very badly, and you are capable of more than you currently believe and imagine,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island House of Representatives voted 60 to eight Thursday to pass a “Red Flag” bill that would allow courts to take action against individuals who own a firearm and are considered to pose imminent danger to themselves or others. The House also voted to pass legislation (<a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText18/HouseText18/H7688Aaa.pdf">H-7075</a>) banning “bump stocks,” which are modifications to semiautomatic weapons that increase their firing rate. Both bills will now move on to the state senate. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legislation similar to the Red Flag bill is being considered by lawmakers in states across the country following the Parkland, Florida shooting, in which the gunman displayed warning signs of violence prior to the incident. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Red Flag bill “gives law enforcement the tools necessary to intervene at a very crucial time,” allowing law enforcement act quickly to disarm a potential shooter, said Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, D-Cranston, a bill co-sponsor, at the legislative session. “The professional law enforcement community” has emphasized that “this is the bill that is needed to protect everyone,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Red Flag bill enables police officers to petition for “extreme risk protection orders” to be issued against individuals exhibiting one or more of 11 different behaviors that make them a potentially active threat. Considerations would include criminal and mental health history, patterns of violence or domestic abuse and substance and alcohol abuse history. Ultimately, a judge would decide whether the petition provided “clear and convincing evidence” for a protection order to be issued. The orders would last for one year and can be renewed. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In February, Gov. Gina Raimondo passed a red flag executive order as a preliminary measure to achieve the same objectives.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The House Judiciary Committee voted 12 to zero to approve the Red Flag bill Tuesday, with two Republican members abstaining. However, the committee also made a series of major revisions in response to concerns that the Red Flag bill could infringe upon civil liberties. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The key change to the bill includes ensuring that only law enforcement would have the right to file a petition for protective orders; previously, the attorney general and family members of the person in question were also allowed to do so, according to a list of talking points provided by the Office of the Speaker of the House. Officers would be required to provide “credible evidence” sworn under oath.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The new version of the bill also stated that “unlawful, threatening or reckless use or brandishing of a firearm” in social media posts could serve as grounds for a judge to grant an order. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many of the changes came in response to a 14-page report released by the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union in March. The report warned that the Red Flag bill could set a precedent for law enforcement and courts to violate civil rights without adequate due process.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When you are dealing with legislation, the devil is always in the details,” said Steven Brown, director of Rhode Island’s ACLU. “The danger is that (the Red Flag bill) ends up getting used for purposes that it was never intended to be used for. There are provisions in the bill that authorize action against individuals based on very vague and open-ended standards.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to the ACLU’s report, the bill’s broad scope could be used as a pretext for police to remove lawfully owned weapons from alleged gang members or people using “overblown political rhetoric” on social media. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moreover, when police are tasked with exercising significant discretion, that power is often used disproportionately against marginalized groups, Brown said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The ACLU also called into question the duration of the protective orders; the fact that courts could compel individuals to engage in mental health evaluations, or else face contempt of court; and the bill’s loose definition of “imminent danger.” Individuals with criminal backgrounds or histories of mental health issues without a record of recent violence could still face protective orders if a judge determines that they pose an imminent and “significant” danger. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The bill places judges in the unenviable — indeed, impossible — position of trying to predict who may and may not become a mass murderer,” the ACLU report noted. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence has not endorsed the Red Flag bill, according to Katherine Kerwin, director of communications for the coalition.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Larry Berman, director of communications for the Office of the Speaker, Mattiello and the Red Flag bill’s other sponsors reviewed similar legislation from other states like California and Oregon. They also consulted extensively with state agencies to make adjustments prior to Thursday’s vote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The revised bill now requires the court to review protective orders within 30 days of their issue and for individuals to be given access to a public defender. There would also be the opportunity to submit a written request for appeal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition, measures have been taken to guard against intentional false reporting. The penalty for filing a petition for a protective order in “bad faith” would lead to fines of $5,000 and up to five years of imprisonment. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But for some legislators, these changes to the Red Flag bill were not sufficient to mitigate due process concerns. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We should be taking guns from people who should not have them. I think everyone agrees with that — the question is, how do we do it?” said House Minority Whip Blake Filippi, R-Block Island. “I don’t think this bill respects the process (that) is necessary to take away someone’s fundamental right.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nevertheless, proponents of the bill place a premium on the number of lives it could save. Rep. Teresa Tanzi, D-Narragansett, emphasized the bill’s role in suicide prevention. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Nine out of 10 people who attempt suicide and do not complete suicide go on to never attempt again,” Tanzi said. “Now, those who attempt suicide with a handgun — nine out of ten of those individuals do not survive. … You take the gun out of the equation, (they would) go on to live full, productive, happy lives.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Approximately 70 supporters of Moms Demand Action, an organization advocating gun control that helped develop the Red Flag bill, formed a visible presence at the legislative session. Sitting in bright red shirts in the wings of the house, they clapped quietly when the bill was passed. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I joined Moms after (the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting); I lived in that area, and it just destroyed me,” said Barbara Swanson of Narragansett, a survivor engagement leader responsible for coordinating with survivors of shootings to advocate for gun control. “But for some reason, Parkland destroyed me worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I have grandchildren; I don’t want them to live in a violent society,” she added. “We have a second amendment, but with rights come responsibilities.”</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Robyn Giragosian did not plan for her nude photographs to proliferate throughout her community when she took them for her partner at the beginning of their romantic relationship. But now, when she goes to work at Headstart, drops her kids off at school or works with staff at her congressional delegation, Giragosian knows that many of her peers and coworkers have seen her naked body. “You can only imagine the embarrassment and anguish I felt and continue to feel,” Giragosian testified at a House hearing April 3, adding that she could have lost her job and her ability to support her family if she had worked for a less supportive organization. Like many women across the state and beyond, Giragosian is a victim of “revenge porn,” the non-consensual distribution of sexually explicit images or videos.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As recently as last week, Giragosian had no legal recourse against the ex-boyfriend who had sent hundreds of emails containing her private photos and videos. But on April 13, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed legislation that bans revenge porn in the state. The bill (H7452/S2450), approved unanimously by the House last Thursday and the Senate last Tuesday, criminalizes the non-consensual dissemination of electronic images of identifiable people 18 years or older who are engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Giragosian is far from alone in her experience with revenge porn and its consequences. A <a href="https://datasociety.net/blog/2016/12/13/nonconsensual-image-sharing/">report</a> conducted by Data and Society found that 4 percent of U.S. internet users have been a victim of revenge porn. The effects of this form of dating violence can be excruciating: According to a <a href="https://www.cybercivilrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/RPStatistics.pdf">study</a> by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, 51 percent of victims of revenge porn targets have had suicidal thoughts, 93 percent say they have suffered significant emotional distress and 82 percent said they have suffered significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning as a result of revenge porn. Ten percent of women under the age of 30 have been threatened with revenge porn. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island legislation — known as the “Electronic Imaging Act” — is not the State House’s first attempt to address revenge porn. Two years ago, a bill supported by Attorney General Peter Kilmartin made it through the General Assembly, only to be vetoed by Gov. Gina Raimondo on the grounds that the bill’s general language threatened freedom of speech, including the publication of some news images. The governor has previously thrown her support behind versions of the bill that require proof of the perpetrator’s malintent. This year, representatives of the Attorney General and the governor arrived at a compromise and created a bill satisfactory to both offices.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Both (our office and the governor’s) are very comfortable that we are protecting victims and making sure this bill is legally sound,” said Joee Lindbeck, assistant attorney general at Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Governor is yet to sign the bill, though her office has <a href="http://www.630wpro.com/2018/04/10/rhode-island-ag-governor-reach-compromise-on-revenge-porn-bill/">indicated</a> that she will. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Unlike previous versions of proposed legislation, the current bill says that in order to be found guilty, the perpetrator must have shared the image “with reckless disregard for the likelihood that the depicted person will suffer harm” or with “intent to harass, intimidate, threaten or coerce the person that is depicted,” testified Rep. Robert Craven, D-Providence, lead sponsor of the bill.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The bill includes exemptions meant to address concerns that criminalizing the publication of photos violates the freedom of speech. Images related to law enforcement, medical treatment, scientific activities and events or figures of public concern are among the exemptions enumerated in the bill.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“These exemptions more than protect the first amendment,” Lindbeck said at the House hearing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence advocated on behalf of the legislation during the House hearing. “Every year that we go without getting this law enacted … causes pain to the victims that are traumatized by this most cruel form of abuse,” testified John Wessley, director of policy for the coalition.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But not all of the state’s players are satisfied with the language in the bill passed Thursday. Executive Director of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union Steven Brown cautioned that though he supports the concept of criminalizing revenge porn, the language of the legislation does not articulate well enough that there must be an “intent to harm an individual,” Brown said at the House hearing. Without more specific language, a teenager sharing hacked photos of a celebrity with a friend would qualify as a criminal, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The RIACLU and the Rhode Island Press Association, which includes the Providence Journal and Newport Daily News, are particularly concerned with the ramifications that the bill may have for media outlets throughout the state. President of RIPA James Bessette said he is concerned that newsrooms would have to “perform self-censorship” and potentially withold content deserving of public attention for fear of a lawsuit. If sued under the Electronic Imaging Act, “we could have a situation where it wouldn’t be the editors deciding what is suitable for public consumption, but rather a 12 person jury,” Bassette testified during the House hearing. He cited an infamous photograph known as “Napalm Girl,” which featured a nine-year-old running naked on a road during the Vietnam War. Despite his concerns, Bessette said he prefers the passed legislation to the Attorney General’s bill proposed last year. The previous version of the bill included less language on intent than the one passed last week, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Sociology Gregory Elliott, who teaches a class titled SOC 1440: “Intimate Violence,” is also opposed to the bill. His concerns are not first-amendment related, but rather due to his belief that legislation is generally an ineffective tool to prevent revenge porn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If you understand what human beings are like and what the social systems they create and maintain are like, then you’ll see you don’t have to make a social problem a … legal problem,” Elliott said, adding that revenge porn perpetrators should be met with “ceremonies of reconciliation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Giragosian, however, believes the legislation may deter the cybercrime that has infringed on her privacy. “Had (the bill) been enacted at the time, (my ex-boyfriend) may have thought twice before taking such action,” she said at the hearing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Island is one of a handful of states without legislation directly addressing revenge porn. According to a <a href="https://www.cybercivilrights.org/revenge-porn-laws/">report</a> by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit organization serving victims of cyber crimes, 38 states and Washington, D.C. have criminal laws against revenge porn. In April 2017, a Washington, D.C. Superior Court judge imposed a 10-year sentence in a case involving revenge porn — the first conviction under the capital’s 2014 image exploitation law, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/dc-man-becomes-first-to-be-convicted-under-districts-new-revenge-porn-law/2017/04/19/2e6ab4ca-2516-11e7-b503-9d616bd5a305_story.html?utm_term=.4cf6b288fda6">reported</a> The Washington Post.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The United States Congress is also working toward legislation to criminalize revenge porn. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2162/text">The ENOUGH Act</a> — bipartisan legislation introduced by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-C.A., and Rep. Jackie Speier, D-C.A., in Nov. 2017 — would make it unlawful “to knowingly distribute a private, visual depiction of an individual’s intimate parts or of an individual engaging in sexually explicit conduct, with reckless disregard for the individual’s lack of consent to the distribution.” The bill came a year after Speier proposed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5896">Intimate Privacy Protection Act</a> of 2016, which only made it to the House of Representatives.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The ENOUGH Act has bipartisan support from congressmen including Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas; it is also backed by tech companies including Facebook and Twitter. While the national legislation has not yet reached the floor in this legislative session, the state-level bill is well on track to be signed into law. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gov. Raimondo is “fully supportive of this version of the bill and looks forward to signing it,” wrote Josh Block, press secretary at the Governor’s office, adding that Raimondo believes that “no one should ever have to endure the trauma and embarrassment of having a private photo published.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Giragosian stressed that the legislation will have wide-ranging effects. “I never thought this was something that could happen to me, but the reality is it could happen to anyone,” Giragosian said.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">While some high school students dream of going to college far away from home, others set their sights on a more proximate goal. Four-hundred fifty-seven Rhode Island students applied to the undergraduate Class of 2022 this year, according to Dean of Admission Logan Powell. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is unclear whether the Office of College Admision has an official policy that favors local students. The University “does not report specifics on the number of students who were admitted” to the class of 2022 from Rhode Island, wrote Director of Admission for Special Programs Ana Saul-Sykes in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We want to have a healthy representation of local students on our campus; they have a valuable perspective to add, and we invest time and energy to recruit those students during the fall and spring,” Saul-Sykes wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University fosters close relationships with high schools throughout Rhode Island by doing school visits, participating in forums and hosting counselor breakfasts, Saul-Sykes wrote. The University also provides $50,000 per year in college scholarship funds to Providence public school students, who may use the grants to attend any two- or four-year college.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Most admitted students come from Providence, Barrington and South County, Saul-Sykes wrote. Classical High School in Providence alone sent seven students to Brown in 2017 and 13 in 2016, said Louis Toro, guidance director at Classical High School. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Island students may choose to study locally because of the University’s state-wide reputation, Saul-Sykes added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I first decided to apply (to the University) because it was a great school that I had heard a lot about growing up,” said Olivia Bowen ’20, who came to Brown from Barrington High School.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For other R.I. students, their decisions to apply and chances of acceptance could be influenced by familial connections to the University, Bowen added. “There are a lot of local students who are connected to the University because of sheer proximity: legacies, the children of faculty and professors,” she said. “In high school, I worried that I wouldn’t be able to compete against kids with those advantages.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Toro believes that the University should prioritize R.I. residents in its admissions process. “There has to be some type of commitment for the city of Providence’s kids in light of all the real estate Brown is chewing up without paying taxes,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Private colleges and universities own approximately 12 percent of the assessed value of property in Providence. The University is one of the city’s biggest tax-exempt non-profits — a point of contention between the institution and state government officials, reported <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204062704577221653128623004?ns=prod/accounts-wsj">The Wall Street Journal</a>. In 2012, a <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/news/brown-taxes">GoLocalProv investigation</a> found that the University avoided more than $4 million in property taxes by expanding its tax-exemption to buildings not exclusively used for academic purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the University has also provided the city with sizable financial contributions. In 2017, the University paid over $6.7 million to the city in voluntary payments. It also pays $2.3 million in city and state fees, which go toward services like sewer water treatment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Much can be accomplished by working in a mutually cooperative, collaborative way to successfully advance economic development and the prosperity of the city of Providence and state of Rhode Island,” according to a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/providence/faq">University webpage</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown has had a profound impact on Bowen, as both a student and an R.I. native, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Brown’s policies … affect not only my undergraduate education for the next few years, but also my home and community for the foreseeable future,” she added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ban the tan: new bill proposes prohibiting tanning beds for minors</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As the weather heats up, some R.I. residents are turning to tanning beds to prepare for the new season. But the R.I. General Assembly could put an end to this activity. On April 3, the R.I. Senate passed legislation that would ban anyone younger than 18 from using a tanning bed ­— hoping to replace current laws that allow minors to use the beds with parental consent. The bill (S2299A) is sponsored by Sen. Majority Whip Maryellen Goodwin (D-24) and Rep. Mia Ackerman (D-45). The bill’s house equivalent (H7136) was held for further study in February.</p>
<p class="p2">“All tanning is skin damage, and even one single tanning session drastically increases a young person’s risk for skin cancer,” said Goodwin in a General Assembly press release. “It’s time to start treating tanning like the public health threat that it really is.”</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/pressrelease/_layouts/RIL.PressRelease.ListStructure/Forms/DisplayForm.aspx?List=c8baae31-3c10-431c-8dcd-9dbbe21ce3e9&amp;ID=13650&amp;randId=0.8781965751958811">Many states</a> across the country have laws addressing tanning booth use by minors. Sixteen states, including Massachusetts and New Hampshire, bar anyone under 18 from using tanning booths in all cases except those when patients are prescribed ultraviolet rays as medical treatment, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p class="p2">These laws have had positive effects on skin cancer rates in young adults, according to Deb Girard, executive director of IMPACT Melanoma.</p>
<p class="p2">“Melanoma rates in young adults are declining,” Girard said, adding that she hopes the rates will continue to decrease as regulation increases across the nation.</p>
<p class="p2">Girard said there have been efforts to limit tanning by minors for over 10 years. The biggest obstacle in the decade-long legislative process has been the indoor tanning industry, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">Martin Weinstock, professor of dermatology and community health at the Alpert Medical School, has done extensive research on the effects of tanning beds on skin cancer rates. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/106/7/dju219/1010489#90259852">His study</a> found that indoor tanning “does increase your risk (of melanoma) substantially.”</p>
<p class="p2">Weinstock believes the industry minimizes the clear health concerns surrounding tanning beds by advertising to young customers. The tanning bed’s UV exposure can be “potentially addicting,” he said, adding that the light can cause a chemical reaction in the brain. “They are marketing addictive, carcinogenic, radiation exposure to young adults,” he said. “It’s pretty reprehensible.”</p>
<p class="p2">Weinstock said that the Affordable Care Act has decreased the number of tanning salons in the country. The ACA placed an excise tax on tanning booth salons, known as a “tanning tax.” This regulation has made tanning more expensive, causing many salons to go out of business, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Stasa Bogacz, an employee at Maximum Exposure Tanning Salon in Providence and a senior at the University of Rhode Island, said that “it’s not too common” to see minors at Maximum Exposure, adding that when minors do come in, it is often for special events like prom. Despite being a molecular biology student who has studied the development of cancer, Bogacz herself uses a tanning bed about once a week, she said.</p>
<p class="p2">Though the salon makes clients sign consent forms that detail the danger of tanning beds, many customers choose to use the tanning bed over the spray tan because they are worried that spray tans would cause<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“oranging,” stained clothes or uneven coloring, Bogacz said.</p>
<p class="p2">The spray tan, another version of artificial tanning, is not associated with any health concerns, Weinstock said. Though spray tans themselves are not dangerous, they encourage harmful sun exposure in those clients, who think the “base tan” color from the service protects them from sun damage, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">“The healthiest color for your skin is the color you’re born with,” Weinstock said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Providence County 2020 Census test underway</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tony’s Meat Market in Central Falls prominently features a stack of “Nuevos Horizontes,” a local Spanish language newspaper. The paper’s April 9 issue on display devoted two front-page stories to the potential impact of the 2020 census on the city’s community members.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Providence County — which includes Rhode Island’s largest cities —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is currently the only active test site in the United States for the 2020 census. Local leaders have warned that the test run is experiencing low turnout rates due to poor funding, little publicity and the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Test census and census stakes</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On March 16, residents of Providence County were notified by mail and directed to fill out an online form available through July 31, according to New York Regional Director of the Census Bureau Jeffrey Behler, who oversees the test run. The census test consists of 10 questions and takes about 10 minutes to complete. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While three locations were originally selected as test sites for the census — Bluefield-Beckley-Oak Hill, West Virginia; Providence County, R.I.; and Pierce County, Washington — “due to budget issues,” the test run is only being conducted in Providence, Behler said. The demographically diverse county represents a “microcosm of the nation,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the 2018 test run count is not official, it provides a way to ensure that the mechanisms necessary to carry out the 2020 census are working properly and will attain an accurate count, Behler said. Providence County includes about 263,000 housing units, all of which will need to complete the census test. The official census carries significant political weight — in the 2015 fiscal year, 132 programs referenced U.S. Census Bureau data to determine the allocation ofover $675 billion in federal funding.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We all need (federal) funding for public safety, health, education, housing and the allocation,” Central Falls Mayor James Diossa told The Herald. “Knowing how many people are in a community is important for (when) we allocate a budget or put together programming, and (it) needs to be accurate.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhode Island is also in danger of losing one of its two congressional district seats. If the state is found to have 157 fewer residents than its last count, its representation will be cut in half, according to analyst Kimball Brace, working off data from 2017 population projections. Indeed, Rhode Island has the smallest average district size — 527,624 — of any state, according to the Providence Mayor’s Office. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There has been no coordinated media or official publicity campaign in Rhode Island to inform the public of the census test, Behler confirmed. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The only time I have interacted with the Census Bureau is to help them direct people to apply (to work) for the Census Bureau,” Diossa said. “There’s really no information out there. There’s nothing. It’s almost as if it’s being set up to fail.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza has advertised the test run on social media and on monthly radio appearances to promote participation, according to Ben Smith, communications specialist for the Mayor’s Office. In addition, the City of Providence has developed a Complete Count Committee, which establishes partnerships among institutions and organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Dorcas International Institute of Rhode Island and Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The members of the Complete Count Committee have been performing community outreach within the populations that they each serve,” Smith wrote in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The important thing in the lead up to 2020 will be whether R.I. political leaders and the nonprofit community step up to encourage participation,” said John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, a non-partisan political accountability organization. This places an additional burden on municipalities to pick up the responsibilities. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Citizenship question and Central Falls turnout</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the U.S. Department of Commerce’s March 26 announcement of its plans to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 census has alarmed local leaders about census turnout. The test census does not currently include a question on citizenship; nevertheless, community members are confused about whether it does and whether the 2020 census will feature the question, according to Steven Brown, executive director of the R.I. chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“A question like this will suppress responses to the census,” Brown told The Herald. “I’m convinced this is not some negligent act on (the Trump Administration’s) part. I think they fully understand the ramifications of placing that question on the census.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The census has historically been racially biased in terms of the people it counts and those who go uncounted. For instance, while both the 2000 and the 2010 censuses saw the white population overcounted by around 1 percent, the Hispanic population was undercounted by well over 1 percent and the black population undercounted by over 2 percent, according to a review issued by the Census Bureau in 2012. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On a Saturday morning in Central Falls, a dozen adult students finished up their work in a GED mathematics class run by Progreso Latino, an advocacy organization. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When I was at work, the first reaction people had (to the census) was, ‘I’m not doing it,’” said Yesenia Hawes, a student who works at a manufacturing plant. “People are afraid.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Students have been asking their teachers about whether they should participate in any aspect of the census process, said Ester Acevedo, adult education coordinator of English for Speakers of Other Languages for Progreso Latino. She added that some of her neighbors are refusing to complete the census. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to the 2016 American Community Survey, Latino individuals make up 63.8 percent of Central Fall’s population . The citizenship question puts Central Falls authorities in a difficult position, Diossa said. He wants to encourage people to participate so that Central Falls can receive the benefits of federal resources. At the same time, he understands the legitimate fears that immigrant or undocumented individuals might have of not wanting to share their citizenship status with the federal government. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The confusion around the census and the fear around it, we’re afraid, is going to dissuade people from filling it out,” Elorza said in a statement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The Department of Commerce is not able to determine definitively how inclusion of a citizenship question on the decennial census will impact responsiveness,” wrote Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a public letter that justified the inclusion of the citizenship question. “However, even if there is some impact on responses, the value of more complete and accurate data derived from surveying the entire population outweighs such concerns.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">States, meanwhile, are pushing back. Rhode Island has joined California, New York and 14 other states in a lawsuit against the government on the grounds that the question is unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For the entire history of the republic, … it’s always been the total number of persons — not citizens, not those who are legally residing in the United States,” Marion said. “People who aren’t citizens still pay taxes, and the census helps determine how much those taxes come back to pay for the services that everyone consumes.” Article 1 of the Constitution states that all persons must be counted for the census, Marion added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both Elorza and Diossa stressed that the question politicized what was intended to be an apolitical process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The long-term of this inclusion (of the citizenship question) comes down to redistricting and gerrymandering,” Diossa said. “People want to be able to draw districts for elected offices, etc., and they know that there are states where they define the lines based on voter populations.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“A lot of people who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, they might be afraid that by sharing this info with the government, they might be hurt in some way,” said Tatyana Tsangarakis-Almeida, Citizenship and Immigration Services program director for the Dorcas International. “They have very basic concerns from when (President) Trump got elected.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Diossa said that the Census Bureau needs to work closely with local community organizations to address the concerns of certain populations — such as undocumented people — that might be wary of participating. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Looking ahead to 2020</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Behler declined to comment or speculate on the citizenship question’s impact on the test run or the 2020 census. However, in response to concerns about publicity and community outreach, Behler noted that in 2020, the Census Bureau will have over 1,000 “partnership specialists” to help assist mayors and organizations administer the census. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“While I certainly understand their concerns, 2020 is going to be completely different when it comes to the ability to provide resources and staff for messaging,” Behler said. “We’ll have a national media campaign, a local media campaign, we’ll have national partnerships. The goal of this test is to really test the system and the interface with the public, not the partnership program or the media program.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 2019 fiscal year budget summary for the Census Bureau calls for additional funding in order for the test to be administered effectively. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The scope and design of the 2020 census can no longer be altered,” the report noted. “If the Census Bureau does not receive the funding requested for the entirety of this work, the quality of the 2020 census will suffer.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Behler remains optimistic both about the test run and the upcoming nationwide census. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Census enumerators will follow up with households or individuals who have not responded with in-person visits from May 9 to July 24. Group quarters — places where individuals are housed together, like prisons, universities and assisted living centers — will be counted between July 18 and Aug. 24. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">College students who attend most of the state’s universities will not be living on campus during the enumeration period, Behler said. However, for the 2020 census, enumerators will likely visit college campuses around January and February, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Students living off-campus in Providence County are currently able to respond to the census survey online, Behler said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Given that we don’t have a robust media campaign … seeing the response we’re getting so far is fantastic,” Behler said. “The system is working.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dorcas International offers aid, support to R.I. immigrants</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">From July 2017 through March 2018, the Dorcas International Institute of Rhode Island helped 116 individuals participating in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and 82 people under Temporary Protected Status renew their immigration papers, said Tatyana Tsangarakis-Almeida ’06, the director of citizenship and immigration services at Dorcas International.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Located in Providence, Dorcas International is the “largest and longest-running legal immigration service in Rhode Island” and provides support to immigrants and refugees throughout the state, according to the organization’s website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4">In addition to advising individuals through the process of renewing their DACA or TPS status, Dorcas International does “all kinds of processes for immigrants and refugees, … (including) naturalization, petitioning for family members and filing green card applications,” Tsangarakis-Almeida said. Since DACA’s creation in 2012, Dorcas International has helped people re-register for the program, which currently protects over 800,000 young immigrants from deportation, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">Following President Donald Trump’s announcement in September 2017 of his directive to end DACA, Dorcas International worked with other immigration advocacy groups from Rhode Island to create a fund to cover the renewal fee for the program, Tsangarakis-Almeida said. “We received a total of $170,000 to provide scholarships for DACA renewal requesters. They covered the $495 (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) fee and also covered our $100 (service) fee,” she said. DACA recipients seeking to renew their participation in the program can visit the organization’s office and submit their application free of charge, she added.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But TPS and Deferred Enforced Departure holders looking to renew their statuses must still pay the USCIS fee as well as Dorcas International’s service fee unless they qualify for a fee waiver, she added. For individuals attempting to re-register for TPS and obtain work authorization, the cost of renewal can range from $410 to $495, according to the USCIS website. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Trump administration has ended TPS for individuals from El Salvador, Nicaragua and Haiti. Trump has also ended the DED designation for Liberians.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the moment, Dorcas International’s biggest challenge is a lack of funding, which prevents the organization from expanding its services and forces it to “only take a handful of deportation cases a year,” Tsangarakis-Almeida said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite these constraints, Christena Carollo, marketing and communications assistant at Dorcas International, said she still finds immense value in the organization’s work. “This is an incredible opportunity to help support the population and help spread the word, and also help anybody who’s here with legal services and education,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For instance, the organization performs regular outreach to undocumented immigrants living in Rhode Island to inform them of their legal rights, Tsangarakis-Almeida said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If we didn’t exist, people would have to rely on the Internet ­— if they have Internet access — or maybe going to a private attorney and paying an arm and a leg” to receive support, she said. “Having this low-cost, reliable option is really important in the community.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a child of immigrant parents, Tsangarakis-Almeida said she personally empathizes with individuals who rely on Dorcas International’s services. “I want to be in this nonprofit setting to be able to help people who can’t afford to be paying more money. It’s just something I feel I need to be doing.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Patricia Santos has been a substitute elementary school teacher in East Providence for two years. Born in Portugal, Santos is fluent in both English and Portuguese and also speaks some Spanish — a multilingual skillset that comes in handy in the classroom. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If they know at least one foreign language, … (teachers) will be able to serve better,” she added. But teachers like Santos are in short supply. As a result, Santos has often been called upon by colleagues to help translate in the classroom. She has also observed that teachers turn to teaching assistants with relevant langauge fluency for help.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">To date, English Language Learners constitute almost one third of students in Providence, according to a letter Mayor Jorge Elorza addressed to R.I. House Finance Committee Chairman Marvin Abney April 5. The letter stressed that Providence Public Schools are not adequately funded to support their ELL students. “While our state made an historic investment in workforce development for ELL students in the FY 2018 budget,” the letter read, “Providence alone spends $18 million educating these students.” The letter asked for “an increase in English Language Learners Funding from $2.5 (million) to $5 (million) in the Governor’s FY 2019 Budget for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elorza’s letter further emphasized that ELL students represent the largest growing population within the Rhode Island education system, and this growth rate is highest in Providence. “Between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, our ELL student population grew by 39 percent and more than one quarter of our student body in 2016 was comprised of ELL students,” Elorza wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Who are English Language Learners?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This funding disparity affects some demographics of Rhode Islanders more directly than others. ELL students in Rhode Island predominantly identify as Latino, according to Providence Public School District Superintendent Christopher Maher. While “Latino does not mean English Language Learner, … most of our English Language Learners are Latinos,” Maher said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In Providence, it’s mostly families from the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and other places — significant Colombian and Puerto Rican population as well; in Providence, we have 54 different languages spoken,” Maher said. But ELL students are not necessarily immigrants, as “40 percent of the English Language Learners in Providence were born in the United States,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some eligible students decide not to use ELL programming because they are often mistaken for immigrants if they do, Maher said. “Why? First of all, it’s a stigma, in many cases. Second of all, there’s fear, because (families) in an ELL classroom (are) concerned about disproportionately being targeted for deportation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There’s a huge fear in many of our families and in our community about that possibility,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the other hand, misconceptions also exist about the specific identified needs of ELL students.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While efforts to aid ELL students center on providing additional resources — such as “adding more teachers that have language certification or specific material supplies” — what they might really need is structural changes in the educational system, said Jason Becker, formerly a Brown lecturer in education and fellow at the Annenberg Institute for School Reform. ELL students might benefit from “lowering the ratio of students to guidance counselors” or decreasing class sizes.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Teacher shortage</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One resource shortage stands out: Not nearly enough teachers are ELL-certified in the state.“The population has changed, and we haven’t shifted to meet the needs of that population,” Maher said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The lack of ELL-certified teachers may be due to the inaccessibility of certification, which is expensive and time-consuming, Maher said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Previously, teachers could earn an ELL certification after taking some courses, said Providence Teachers Union President Maribeth Calabro. But the Rhode Island Department of Education discontinued this system, which “decreased the pool of teachers that could be tapped to teach those students,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“My average teacher is a 20-year veteran in Providence, they’re 47 years old, (and) when you’re at that point in your life, you’ve probably got a family that you’re raising in most cases, and a house and a mortgage. … And we’re saying, ‘Hey, go back and get this degree, get this certificate, which is expensive and time-consuming,’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>… to the point that I think that a lot of people think, ‘I just can’t do it,’” Maher said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, this training and certification are imperative for effectively educating ELL students.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The lack of adequate funds for ELL-teacher certification is one consequence of an overall issue of insufficient resources dedicated to ELL students. This has been a problem for nearly a decade preceding the mayor’s letter this year, since the creation of the Rhode Island school funding formula in 2010.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Rhode Island’s school funding formula</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The formula allocates differing levels of state funding to school districts within Rhode Island. It is weighted for poverty, so that more money is allocated to districts determined to have more students “eligible for the free and reduced-price school lunch program,” according to a Center for American Progress report written by Kenneth Wong, chair of education for Brown. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ELL students were never included directly in this formula, even though there is “a lot of evidence that students in poverty, students with disabilities and English Language Learners” require more money to be educated “at an adequate level,” Maher said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The report cites another reason for not including ELL students in the formula as “avoid(ing) the perverse incentive of overidentification and (creating) the positive incentive for local schools to integrate these students in their mainstream instructional system.” Maher called the idea that school districts would overcount for financial gain “preposterous.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Becker was part of the governor’s committee in 2010 for creating the formula. Becker explained that another reason ELL students were not included was that the four districts with significant proportions of English Language Learners — Pawtucket, Woonsocket, Central Falls and Providence — also had high numbers of students requiring free or reduced lunch. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The committee decided not to weight ELL students in the formula since it estimated that funds allocated to address poverty could also address the needs of ELL students. In addition, the committee was limited in the funds it could disperse. If it were to weight ELL students and fund them at the highest rate possible, districts would receive all the allocated funds only after a period of seven years. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The committee did not want to include any unnecessary additional weighted factors in the formula since they wanted to keep it “as simple as possible” when building it from scratch, Becker said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, Becker imagined that eventually, the General Assembly would amend the formula to include ELL students once the state could fund districts at a rate that would positively impact the learning of ELL students.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So far, this has not happened. Instead, Gov. Gina Raimondo made a separate lump sum of “categorical funding” into a permanent source of funding for ELL students last year. Categorical funding is “state aid intended to provide financial support for specific educational programs, operational functions or financial activities,” according to a report from the Editorial Projects in Education. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When ELL categorical funding was first introduced, it had to be renewed annually, Becker said. However, “Raimondo took an important step — with the support of the General Assembly — by making the (ELL) categorical funding permanent last year,” wrote Communications Officer Meg Geoghegan in an email to The Herald. “The governor and the legislature recognized that we must be equipped to serve and support these students.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, categorical funding has certain disadvantages compared to funding through the formula, as it comes with stringent limitations on how it can be spent. For instance, it might be harder to use categorical funding for broader changes such as decreasing class sizes because these reforms do not specifically target ELL students, Becker said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think of it as a really crappy way to fund ELL students; it should have been in the formula,” Becker added. Despite the fact that the ELL categorical fund is now a permanent fund, the amount of money allocated to ELL programming each year is variable and is decided by the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Having to redetermine the amount of money provided by the categorical fund creates and exacerbates political divisions between districts, Becker added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition, urban and suburban districts often have different funding priorities, said State Rep. Gregg Amore, D-Providence. This often means that there hasn’t been a unified push for adequate funding for ELL students. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A suburban district would be far more concerned with having transportation costs weighted in the formula than the inclusion of ELL students, Amore added. On the other hand, urban districts see ELL students as a higher funding priority.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A representative of an urban district and a former teacher, Amore agreed with Becker. “I would much prefer to see ELL begin to be baked into the overall funding formula,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">But Wong, another former member of the funding formula committee, pointed out one advantage of categorical funding: the greater constraints on what is funded facilitate tracing money directly to impact and identify which methods and practices actually help ELL students.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The district needs to prove that they are using the resources effectively to support learning,” which acts as an accountability measure, Wong said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">But “There’s a feeling among many of my colleagues that the funding formula needs to be opened up next year,” including for discussion of ELL funding, Amore said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“As goes Providence, so goes the state; if we can’t right the ship in Providence public education, we’re going to have a problem going forward for decades to come,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>State efforts</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Two bills, H7436 in the House and S2506 in the Senate, were introduced in February and March, respectively, this year. They stipulate the establishment of an annual fund for a statewide dual language program of $200,000 per year. The bills recognize an overwhelming demand for dual language education, which is especially pronounced in Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dual language refers to “a method of instruction that promotes a student’s full proficiency in all aspects of English and another language,” according to the bills.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Several of the (school) districts already have dual language in their area, but there’s no coordination of effort,” added State Sen. Frank Ciccone III, D-Providence, the Senate bill’s co-sponsor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve tripled the number of dual language programs in Providence in the last three years, and we still have huge waitlists,” Maher said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These bills are not exclusively focused on aiding ELL students, but a number of ELL students attend dual language schools. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">At Leviton Dual Language School, for instance, ELL students account for approximately 50 percent of the students, said Principal Javier Montanez.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The bills “would prioritize funding for districts’ dual language programs that serve a large number of English learners, because we know from many years of research that dual language programs are really the only programs for English learners that will close the achievement gap,” Erin Papa, former president of the R.I. Foreign Language Association, told The Herald. The bills note that “the expansion of funding for (dual language) programs that advance outcomes for English learners is critical to achieving the state’s goal for grade-level reading by the third grade.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It is an educational game changer,” said State Rep. Grace Diaz, D-Providence, the House bill co-sponsor, at a press conference for the bills yesterday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=19IHXJDOLcPgDzEmxieVOafy03rNNQjTlvO92qnWXluY&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Partners HealthCare and Care New England’s definitive agreement to merge announced May 23, President Christina Paxson P’19, who previously criticized the merger, stated in a press release that she was “optimistic” about the deal. This vote of confidence comes after the University’s conversations with Partners and CNE over the last five months about strengthening health care in Rhode Island, according to Brian Clark, d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">irector of news and editorial development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Preserving and strengthening health care and biomedical research and innovation in Rhode Island continues to be an important priority,” Paxson said in the press release. “As Brown’s discussions with Partners and Care New England continue, I am optimistic that we can address the various concerns that I raised earlier this year.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two health care groups announced their intent to explore the concept of a merger more than a year ago. In January, Paxson wrote that the arrangement “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would likely increase the cost of care and reduce the ability of Rhode Islanders … to have a voice in how our health care system works.” </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/12/u-proposes-merger-care-new-england-health-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paxson was concerned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that health care would shift to Massachusetts, where Partners is located and professional costs are higher, thereby increasing prices for consumers, The Herald previously reported. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Paxson suggested an alternative: the Brown University-Prospect Medical plan, which would keep health care local and merge CNE, the University and California-based Prospect Medical Holdings. Prospect’s Rhode Island presence is centered on CharterCARE Health Partners, which operates Our Lady of Fatima Hospital and Roger Williams Medical Center, among others. However, the University’s proposal was </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/23/mcdonald-paxsons-promotion-prospect-medical-holdings-risks-poor-health-care-university/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized by United Nurses and Allied Professionals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was concerned with Prospect’s track record on patient care and safety. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The University is no longer pursuing this alternative plan, instead shifting its attention to continuing conversations with Partners and CNE, Clark wrote in an email to The Herald. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Achieving a health care solution involving Brown, Care New England and Partners that promises to demonstrate strong benefits for Rhode Island would take the place of the alternative to the Partners acquisition that Brown had proposed in January with Prospect Medical/CharterCARE,” he wrote. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, CharterCARE Rhode Island continues to worry about the impact of merging CNE and Partners.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Partners acquisition of Care New England will be devastating for Rhode Island health care consumers, employers and insurance providers. Rhode Island regulators have already rung the alarm bell that Partners will use their market leverage to increase reimbursement rates if this merger moves forward,” wrote Bill Fischer, spokesperson for CharterCARE, in an email to The Herald. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mere contemplation of this merger has already cost Rhode Islanders </span><a href="http://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/blackstone-valley/health-dept-oks-closing-memorial-hospital-emergency-department_20180327075348230/1082457125"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds of jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the closure of Memorial Hospital and left thousands of residents in the Blackstone Valley with </span><a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/news/ris-healthcare-industry-just-took-another-big-turn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inadequate access to emergency room care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="http://www.wpri.com/news/eyewitness-news-investigates/study-partners-takeover-of-care-new-england-could-raise-ri-health-insurance-premiums/1082559013"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commissioned by Rhode Island released in February found it likely that Partners would seek to increase CNE’s revenue if the two companies were merged, which would ultimately raise Rhode Island health insurance premiums.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Partners’ Vice President of Communications Rich Copp highlighted the advantages of the merger, such as improved patient care, research and new investments.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Certainly it will also mean new investments in Brown University-led research,” Copp said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of this research is conducted in partnership with the seven hospitals affiliated with the Alpert Medical School — one of which is owned by CNE, Women &amp; Infants Hospital. This research could translate into clinical practice, with applications for patients in Rhode Island and elsewhere, Clark said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“An academic medical center in Rhode Island plays an integral role in strengthening health care for Rhode Islanders and contributing to economic development,” Clark said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the merger is not final until it is approved by several state and federal regulatory bodies and leaders, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Massachusetts Health policy commission, the Massachusetts attorney general, the Rhode Island Department of Health and the Rhode Island attorney general, Copp said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifespan, the largest health care provider in Rhode Island, continues to engage in discussion with Partners HealthCare and CNE to explore ways to work on “building upon our world-class health system,” wrote David Levesque, Lifespan spokesperson in an email to The Herald. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Partners and Care New England’s announcement was not surprising, as the two organizations have been in negotiations for more than a year,” Levesque wrote. “Lifespan, Partners’ and CNE talks — </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/02/lifespan-eyes-care-new-england-partners-healthcare-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">started in February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — remain productive as both organizations thoughtfully consider their futures in an ever-changing health care environment.”</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">After 42 years of featuring films in a uniquely intimate setting, Cable Car Cinema and Cafe shut the doors of its 204 South Main St. location May 27, the owners announced in a Facebook post April 26. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The closure comes at the tail end of negotiations with the Rhode Island School of Design, which owns the building, wrote owners Daniel Kamil and Emily Steffian in the Facebook post. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cable Car occupied the space through a 10-year lease that ends in September 2018, according to a statement from RISD. On April 16, after unsuccessful lease renewal discussions, the owners notified RISD that they would not be seeking a new lease.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We did not come to this decision lightly,” the owners wrote. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, RISD wrote that it was “saddened” by Cable Car’s decision. The school had been in talks with the owners to explore a number of options that would allow Cable Car remain in that location, such as adding second floor or alternating usage of the space, but ultimately could not agree, Silva </span><a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180427/providences-cable-car-cinema-to-close-after-42-years"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the Providence Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The school offered Cable Car a renewal at a lowered rent, but the owners still refused the offer, RISD wrote, adding that the owners told them their decision to close was “not based on finances.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamil and Steffian responded with another Facebook post asserting that Cable Car was “never formally offered any rent reduction by RISD.” The post also claimed that the theater had made three requests to purchase its Main Street building from RISD, even suggesting in May of 2017 that Cable Car be run as a nonprofit going forward. But none of these requests were accepted, the post stated. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Danielle Mancuso, senior public relations specialist at RISD, did not respond to a request for comment about RISD’s statement.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The theater’s closing was met with nostalgia and dismay from community members.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Brown students know Cable Car as the host of the annual French Film Festival. Sylvie Toux, resident director of the Brown in Paris program and one of the founders of the festival, was sad to learn of Cable Car’s closing. Toux previously lived on Benefit Street, just down the road from Cable Car. A true regular, she would visit the theater twice a week to watch a film, she said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The theater stood out to Toux due to its atmosphere — the same one that had caught the attention of patrons for decades. Audience members sat on couches rather than traditional theater seats. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When Toux started the Providence French Film Festival, she chose Cable Car over other possible venues, such as the Avon Cinema, because the kinds of movies that Cable Car showed were similar to those she wished to feature in the festival, making it the perfect choice, she said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The closing) was very upsetting,” said Lewis Seifert, a professor of French studies who served as head of the department from 2011 through 2017. Cable Car had an “excellent” relationship with the department, Seifert added. As a result of the change, he is concerned about the future of the French Film Festival — even when it does find a new home, the program will probably be shorter and include fewer films, he said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the owners had access to a vast, esoteric filmography, Cable Car made it possible to bring lesser-known titles to the public eye, Seifert said. This may become more difficult now after Cable Car’s closing, which is “a loss for the entire community,” he added. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Blakely, research associate in French Studies and current director of the French Film Festival, noted that Cable Car was always enthusiastic about hosting and accommodating the festival. The event has drawn Brown students and members of the community every year, overflowing the theater, he said. The festival’s upcoming 22nd year will be the first time Cable Car does not host the event, he said. The next location remains uncertain, but the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts and the Avon are possibilities, he added.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the theater officially shut its doors at 204 South Main St. after showing the movie RBG, Cable Car has since hosted a number of screenings at different locations around Providence, such as “The Gospel According to Andre” at the Columbus Theatre. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The owners have not written off the possibility of reopening the “theater with couches” in the future, they wrote. “For the short-term, we will catch our breath, take a moment, and if the right opportunity arises — the Cable Car Cinema may emerge in another locale and in another form,” they wrote, ending their letter by noting that the closing was not a goodbye, but rather a “blackout.”</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>U. reaches agreement with Partners, Care New England</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Partners HealthCare and Care New England announced Aug. 7 that the Alpert Medical School will be their primary academic research and teaching institution in Rhode Island should the two health care systems merge. </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/06/02/partners-care-new-england-settle-on-merger-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partners and CNE definitively announced their intent to merge in May</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though the deal has yet to meet with regulatory approval.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Partners, CNE and the University signed a memorandum of understanding this month to confirm the Med School’s role in the merger in an effort to keep specialty care and research in-state. The memorandum stated that Brown’s president will sit on the CNE Board of Directors and the dean of the Med School will sit on any subcommittees of the board if the merger goes through.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The goal is really to develop a good, healthy, productive relationship that maintains a strong center of biomedicine, clinical care and research and education in Rhode Island,” said President Christina Paxson P’19.</span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/12/u-proposes-merger-care-new-england-health-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paxson was previously a vocal critic of the Partners-CNE deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing fears that the merger would move health care out-of-state since </span><a href="https://www.partners.org/partners-medical-international/Patient-Services/Harvard-Affiliated-Hospitals/Default.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partners is affiliated with Harvard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown’s partnership with CNE is one of the cornerstones of the Med School, Paxson said, adding that one-third of the Med School’s teaching and research takes place within CNE hospitals. Women &amp; Infants Hospital is vital for women’s health issues, and Butler Hospital, which provides psychiatric services, is an important part of Brown’s brain science initiative, she said. “Having those hospitals not be grounded in Rhode Island and not supported as high-end academic research centers would be devastating to the University,” Paxson said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown’s involvement in the Partners-CNE merger also benefits CNE and the state as a whole, Paxson said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partners has made it clear they're interested in investing in academic medicine at Brown, Paxson said, and since Brown is "a big draw," investing in Brown tends to bring more talented drs and health professionals to Providence.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This means the quality of health care for Rhode Island residents would also be maintained, if not improved by the merger, she added. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, the Partners-CNE merger could increase the cost of health care for Rhode Islanders. A February </span><a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/eyewitness-news-investigates/study-partners-takeover-of-care-new-england-could-raise-ri-health-insurance-premiums/1082559013"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commissioned by the state found it likely that Partners would seek to increase CNE’s revenue if the two companies were merged, which would ultimately raise Rhode Island health insurance premiums. In her initial criticism of the Partners-CNE merger in January, Paxson too voiced concern that the merger would raise cost of health care. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Partners is not the cheapest alternative of potential mergers with CNE, said Steve Rasmussen, chair of psychiatry and human behavior and previous medical director for Butler. “But being a nonprofit, it doesn’t have to return 20 percent of its return to investors,” Rasmussen added. “Instead, that can be plowed into strengthening the organization and academic pursuits.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The University previously proposed an alternative merger deal for CNE with Prospect Medical Holdings, a for-profit group.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While Paxson has not confirmed that her prior concerns about the merger have been entirely alleviated, she did emphasize that the memorandum moved things in “the right direction” for Brown’s growing relationship with CNE-Partners and health care in Rhode Island. Rhode Island’s economy could also grow as a result of the merger, she said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you combine the strength of Partners with the strength of Brown, it’s going to become a very attractive place for investment for new biotech,” Rasmussen said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CNE has been struggling financially, Rasmussen said, adding that he believes Partners is CNE's best possible option because the Massachusetts health care system is financially healthy. In addition, Partners is "very academically oriented,” he said, which would bring “multiple benefits to (CNE's) medical school in Rhode Island.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rhode Island, Massachusetts and federal regulatory authorities must sign off on the deal before Partners and CNE officially merge. Partners recently requested an expedited regulatory review process from Rhode Island, according to Partners spokesperson Rich Copp. The timeline for the merger depends on how long the regulatory process takes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“If things went smoothly, we could possibly be talking about sometime around the new year,” Copp said. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Rhode Island has received $3 million of the $380 million doled out by the federal government in April 2018 to improve election security. The state will dedicate the majority of its funding to improving the voter registration database, cybersecurity and auditing practices, according to the Help America Vote Act 2018 Funding Recommendations. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Island voters will cast their ballots in primary elections Sept. 12.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">HAVA originated two years after the disputed 2000 presidential election, and is resurfacing with additional funds following evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. A 2018 bill appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars to the HAVA 2018 Election Security Fund — the first appropriation since 2010, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s <a href="https://www.eac.gov/2018-hava-election-security-funds/">website</a>. President Trump signed the appropriations bill, titled the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1625/text">Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">More than half of Rhode Island’s $3 million election security budget will go toward upgrading the Central Voter Registration System, according to the HAVA <a href="http://sos.ri.gov/assets/downloads/RI-HAVARecommendations2018.pdf">2018 Funding Recommendations</a>, compiled by R.I. Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea. The R.I. Department of State looks to include experts from the University and Salve Regina University to increase the strength of the CVRS, according to the 2018 Election Cybersecurity report. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Substantial funding has also been allotted to improve cybersecurity and data recovery as well as to implement risk-limiting audits. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Risk-limiting audits are the “gold standard” when it comes to election auditing, according to Liz Howard, counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Howard, who previously worked as deputy commissioner for the Virginia Department of Elections, focuses her work on cybersecurity and elections. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The audits use statistical analysis to determine if any intentional or unintentional factors have affected the outcome of an election, Howard said. While a regular audit looks only at an individual voting block or precinct, the new audit system will review the entire jurisdiction. The new system may allow state officials to review fewer ballots than under a traditional audit by mandating that officials scan the entire state instead of closely focusing on individual precincts, Howard said. During closer races, however, more ballots will be reviewed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A 2017 bill passed by the state Legislature mandates that the risk-limiting audits be used for the 2020 presidential primary and general elections.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., is focused on the importance of election security as he campaigns for his re-election in September.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“President Trump’s most senior intelligence officials report that Russia is targeting our midterm elections right now. That comes on top of troubling reports from state and local officials, tech companies and nonpartisan experts about sophisticated Russian campaigns to influence our elections,” Whitehouse wrote in a statement to The Herald, adding that he and Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., are working hard to “bolster our defenses by increasing funding for state election security.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While elections in five states depend entirely on electronic machines, Rhode Island is sticking with paper, according to Deputy Director of Elections Miguel Nunez. Paper voting is one of the most important mechanisms to ensure election security, Howard said, citing a 2017 DEFCON 25 Voting Machine Hacking Village report that showed paperless machines were vulnerable to hacking. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Every piece of equipment in the Voting Village was effectively breached in some manner,” the report read, adding that even “participants with little prior knowledge and only limited tools and resources were quite capable of undermining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these systems.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Still, paper machines are also vulnerable. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“No machine is unhackable,” Howard said, adding that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the audit is necessary to check for interference. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While Rhode Island remains loyal to paper voting, the state is changing up check-in protocol. The biggest change voters will see on election day is an electronic poll book, which will allow voters to sign their names before voting on an iPad, Nunez said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><i>This article is part of The Herald’s ongoing coverage of the 2018 Rhode Island elections.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The penultimate primary in the country will take place a week from today in Rhode Island and will decide the party candidates in several state elections, including in mayoral, gubernatorial and federal races. No independent candidates are involved in primary elections. </span></p>
<p class="p4">A photo ID is necessary to vote in the Sept. 12 primaries. The deadline to register to vote in this year’s Nov. 6 general election is Oct. 7.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>United States Congress</b></p>
<p class="p4">In the upcoming race for the U.S. House of Representatives, the University falls in House District 1 — where incumbent David Cicilline ’83 is running against<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Christopher Young, who has run in both U.S. Senate and House races, as well as for mayor of Providence multiple times. Patrick Donovan and Frederick Wysocki are squaring off on the Republican ballot. Donovan did not respond by press time and The Herald was unable to reach out to Wysocki for comment.</p>
<p class="p4">Of Rhode Island’s two sitting Democratic senators, only Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., is up for re-election this year. He is challenged from the left by Patricia Fontes, a peace activist. Whitehouse did not respond by press time, while Fontes could not be reached for comment. Vying for the Republican ticket are Rhode Island attorney and former Associate R.I. Supreme Court Justice Robert Flanders Jr. ’71<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and businessman Roque “Rocky” de la Fuente, a California resident who is running simultaneously in six different states. De la Fuente could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="p4">“In my race, national issues predominate, though as I learn from every visit to a senior center, all politics are local,” Flanders wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">While both the U.S. House and Senate have upcoming elections, “the big contest is in the House this time around,” said Professor of Political Science Richard Arenberg. Twenty-six of the 35 Senate seats up for re-election this term are defended by Democrats, which means Democrats would have to win all of their seats and flip two seats currently held by Republicans to achieve a majority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The race is tighter for the House, where approximately 30 seats are considered toss-ups —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>creating an opportunity for Democrats to turn the currently red House blue.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Arenberg said there is “a tendency to maybe underestimate the possibility of Democrats also taking the Senate.” There are six closely contested races — four held by Republicans and two by Democrats, according to the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/07/us/politics/senate-midterm-elections.html"> New York Times.</a></span></p>
<p class="p4">Rhode Island has historically elected Democrats to Congress since the 1940s, according to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Rhode_Island_state_profile_2018">Ballotpedia,</a> and is considered a solidly blue state. But while “it’s a very blue state, it’s full of different shades of blue. You have those very progressive Democrats and you also have some Democrats who may, in other parts of the country, feel more like Republicans,” said Alexander Cramer ’21, Brown Democrats’ communications director.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s really important for anyone living in Rhode Island, whether a student or otherwise, … to take the responsibility both to find out who their candidates are and not necessarily just vote based on who the party will elect as a candidate,” Cramer added.</p>
<p class="p4">Both the Brown Democrats and the Brown Republicans told The Herald they plan to wait for the outcomes of the primaries to champion the winning candidates.</p>
<p class="p4">Rhode Island’s population is represented by two representatives in the House, though this could decrease to one representative for the 2022 elections following the 2020 census; in 2017, Rhode Island was 157 residents away from losing a representative, according to<a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/eyewitness-news-investigates/ri-is-now-within-157-residents-of-losing-a-us-house-seat-expert-warns/1082453725"> WPRI.</a></p>
<p class="p6"><b>R.I. Governor</b></p>
<p class="p4">The race for governor is hotly contested this year, with three Democrats and three Republicans vying to represent their parties. While Rhode Island is solidly blue at the federal level, gubernatorial control of the state has historically swung between Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p class="p4">Gov. Gina Raimondo, elected in 2014, was the first Democratic governor of Rhode Island to be elected since 1990, according to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Rhode_Island_state_profile_2018">Ballotpedia.</a> If she wins the Democratic primary, as predicted by a July 2018 poll conducted by Fleming &amp; Associates, Raimondo will most likely face Cranston Mayor Allan Fung in the November general election. The same poll shows Fung, who nearly beat Raimondo in 2014, just 2.2 <a href="http://page 22: https://media.wpri.com/nxs-wpritv-media-us-east-1/document_dev/2018/08/06/WPRI%20RWU%20July%202018%20RI%20poll%20for%20web_1533606994687_50895313_ver1.0.pdf">percent behind Raimondo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></a></p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo also faces challenges from the left from former Democratic State Rep. Spencer Dickinson and former Secretary of State Matt Brown. Brown has drummed up local and national support from former governor and U.S. Senator Lincoln Chafee ’75, as well as an endorsement from Our Revolution, a political action organization inspired by Bernie Sanders, among others. Brown did not respond by press time.</p>
<p class="p4">In the Republican primary, Fung is running against businessman, former state senator and military officer Giovanni Feroce and House Minority Leader Patricia Morgan, as previously reported<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/28/giovanni-feroce-joins-rhode-island-gubernatorial-race-candidates/"> by The Herald.</a> Fung, Feroce and Morgan could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="p4">The Brown Republicans plan to focus their efforts on the “especially tight” gubernatorial race, said Brown Republicans President Nicholas Guarino ’20, adding that the group also has its eye on the upcoming Senate election.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Providence Mayor</b></p>
<p class="p4">Mayor Jorge Elorza faces challenges from Kobi Dennis, director of a mentorship program for youth of color named Princes 2 Kings, and Robert DeRobbio, a former educator currently running the nonprofit Resources for R.I. Education. Elorza and DeRobbio could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Lieutenant Governor</b></p>
<p class="p4">Incumbent Dan McKee, who has been in office since 2015, faces off against State Rep. Aaron Regunberg ’12, D-Warwick, in the Democratic primary. Paul Pence is the sole Republican candidate for lieutenant governor.</p>
<p class="p3">Local politics are “our last line of defense” from Republican Washington policy, Regunberg said.</p>
<p class="p4">McKee could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>R.I. State Senate and House Representatives</b></p>
<p class="p4">University students will be voting in District 1 and District 3 for state House and Senate representatives, respectively.</p>
<p class="p3">“This election differs from past cycles. … Because of national politics, (people) are really paying attention to what’s going on at the State House,” said Gayle Goldin, who is running for reelection uncontested to represent District 1 in the State General Assembly, which includes the University.</p>
<p class="p4">In District 3 for the state Senate, current State Sen. Edith Ajello, D-Bristol, Warwick and Providence, faces no opposition either in her primary or from a Republican candidate.</p>
<p class="p4">Ajello could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>City Council</b></p>
<p class="p4">The University falls under the jurisdiction of Ward 2. Helen Anthony, Mark Feinstein and Ryan Holt are running for an open Ward 2 City Council seat. There is also a competitive city council race in Ward 1 with councilman Seth Yurdin running against community organizer Justice Gaines ’16.</p>
<p class="p4">The Herald did not reach out to the candidates for comment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Other Races</b></p>
<p class="p4">Democrat Peter Neronha is running uncontested for attorney general.</p>
<p class="p4">Primaries for secretary of state and general treasurer are also uncontested. Incumbent Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea will be challenged by Republican Pat Cortelessa in the general election, and incumbent General Treasurer Seth Magaziner will face competition from Republican Michael Riley.</p>
<p class="p4">The Herald did not reach out to the candidates for comment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Where to Vote?</b></p>
<p class="p4">On the whole, R.I. candidates encourage students to vote where they live — in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p4">“It is important to vote in the state in which you reside,” Young said.</p>
<p class="p4">“Rhode Island needs your passionate commitment to bring change to our state and our nation. I strongly encourage you to register to vote in Rhode Island,” Raimondo wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">Dennis also emphasized the importance of student participation. “College students should be active, informed participants and vote, but it should be up to them whether they vote in their home state or Rhode Island if Rhode Island isn’t where they are from. They are critical with great ideas, and we need their involvement,” he wrote in an email to The Herald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p4">“The idea that out-of-state students lack a vision of the long-term commitment to the community is an outmoded concept that fails to credit the students with representing the long term interests of the students who follow them,” Pence wrote in an email to The Herald. “Each of us should establish residency and vote accordingly, without concern that their voices are unwelcome in whichever state they choose to vote in.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Regunberg encouraged students to be politically engaged both in their hometowns and while at school. “I would definitely encourage folks, if you’re following closely a swing district race from back home, to make your voice count in that district. But if you’re not from that situation, I would think where you live, you want to be invested in that; you want to know what’s going on; you want to be able to make your voice heard. And so I think people have a lot to gain from following local politics and having a say, and one of the ways you have that say is you vote,” Regunberg said.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Regardless of where students vote, candidates encourage engagement in the community beyond College Hill.</p>
<p class="p4">“You can’t build a fence around Brown. It’s got to be part of the city,” Dickinson said.</p>
<p class="p4">If you are “living here for four years, I think you’re expected to become part of the community that you’re living in for that long,” Cicilline added.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s important to realize that even if you aren’t a Rhode Island voter, that you realize that the voice of students from Brown is very important up at the State House, and you have so much energy and capacity to influence good public policy by coming up and sharing their voice and continuing to be actively engaged,” Goldin said.</p>
<p class="p4">Despite<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>concerns about youth disengagement with politics, “I see a much higher level of interest in this election among my students than before—not just interest, but I think commitment to act, commitment to vote,” Arenberg said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>PawSox to move to Worcester, MA</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Pawtucket PawSox, Rhode Island’s only Triple-A affiliated Minor League Baseball team, signed a letter of intent to move to the Worcester, Massachusetts, Aug. 17, according to the Providence Journal. This decision came after the state Legislature passed a financing bill for the team that was different from what had been originally negotiated and approved by the team.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4776032/Letter-of-Intent-Pawtucket-Red-Sox.pdf">letter</a>, signed by PawSox Chairman Larry Lucchino and Worcester City Manager Edward Augustus Jr., outlines joint financing between the city and team to build an $86 million ballpark in Kelley Square. Worcester would issue $62.6 million in bonds and the team would need to provide a $6 million cash investment and $25.9 million financed through bonds. The agreement also outlines a $35 million grant for infrastructure projects related to the stadium and a clause that states the team will keep all stadium revenue, according to the Journal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team’s decision to relocate to Worcester came as a disappointment to Rhode Island state and local officials alike. Rep. Mary Messier, D-Pawtucket, said a deal to keep the PawSox in the state for the next three decades had been in the works for three years. “I’m just very disappointed that we couldn’t get this done,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The legislation did not start in the House, however. Sen. Donna Nesselbush ’84, D-Pawtucket, was one of three senators who initially introduced the bill detailing the financing of a new stadium in Pawtucket. In the Senate bill, which was drafted with input from the PawSox, the team would have contributed $12 million upfront in equity, and issued a principal debt of $33 million, while the city and state would have contributed $15 million and $23 million in debt respectively. These bonds would have been floated and executed through the Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency. In this bill, more than $80 million in potential borrowing would have been guaranteed by the state, the Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180530/new-financing-plan-for-pawsox-stadium-would-use-state-pawtucket-taxes">reported</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Senate passed the bill only two weeks after it was introduced, according to the Rhode Island General Assembly bill tracker. The House version, described as “a companion bill to the Senate bill,” was introduced soon after Jan. 25, said Messier, who co-sponsored the bill. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the Senate bill passed quickly, it took until May 29 for the House companion bill to get a hearing scheduled by the House Finance Committee, despite the fact that it had been referred the day it was introduced. The bill was then held for further study, heard by the Finance Committee again June 19 and once again held for study. It was finally recommended for passage after alterations were made June 21 and passed the next day, just days before the legislative session ended June 25. It was signed into law by Gov. Gina Raimondo a week later, according to the bill tracker.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Finance Committee, in coordination with House leadership, made changes to the bill that removed the state guarantee and posed higher borrowing costs to the team, according to the Providence Journal. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Speaker of the House Nicholas Mattiello, D-Cranston, “was not in favor of the original bill because he thought it would hurt the taxpayer too much, so he wanted it changed,” Messier said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The version that was ultimately passed “took away the risk for the taxpayers, which was one of the key elements that both my constituents and a number of my colleagues’ constituents were very concerned with,” said House Majority Whip John Edwards, D-Portsmouth and Tiverton. Edwards, who sits on the Finance Committee, said he met with House leadership “at least three times” to talk about changes for the House bill. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the subject of taxpayer risk was not met with unanimus support. The changes made to the final House bill would make it impossible for the team to seek financial assistance from the City of Pawtucket or the state if they were not financially successful, Nesselbush said. “If for any reason the stadium was not making enough money, the investors couldn’t look to the State of Rhode Island or the City of Pawtucket for any payment,” Nesselbush said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“This was calculated risk. It was designed for the ballpark to pay for itself, and for the economic development spurred by the ballpark to enable the city and the state to make their debt payment … in a revenue-neutral way that wouldn’t cost the taxpayers any money,” Nesselbush said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think that the PawSox were a tried and true successful business,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Blame was quick to follow the announcement of the PawSox move. Nesselbush called out Mattiello in a public Facebook post for not prioritizing the passage of the House bill. Allan Fung, Republican gubernatorial candidate, told the Providence Journal that “the dysfunctional relationship between the Governor, Speaker and Senate President prevented any deal from ever happening, and now families and local businesses are paying the price.” Fung opposed the initial deal made with the Senate, according to the Journal. Fung’s campaign did not respond to muliple requests for comment from The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The changes were not agreed upon by the PawSox. That’s why they left. … At no time were the Governor, the Speaker, the Senate President, the PawSox, the Mayor of Pawtucket or the Pawtucket reps all in a room together. Never,” Messier said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">PawSox President Charles Steinberg, along with Lucchino, wanted the team to stay in state. Had the House passed the Senate’s version of the bill, the team would have stayed in Pawtucket, according to the Journal. Despite the desire to stay in state, the letter of intent signed with Worcester provided a significantly more attractive financial deal to the team. The team will provide $6 million in upfront equity, which is half of what the House bill would have required, and over $7 million less in issued debt. The Worcester Division of Planning and Regulatory Services declined to provide further comment, and the PawSox did not provide comment by press time.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In an Aug. 22 press conference recorded by NBC 10 News, Raimondo and Pawtucket Mayor Donald Grebien avoided placing blame and instead focused on the future of Pawtucket’s downtown district. “We’re committed … to continuously move forward,” Grebien said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo reiterated her support for Pawtucket and congratulated Grebien on his efforts to keep the team in state. “You put your all into it,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“To compete with Worcester’s offer would have jeopardized our city’s future, and I would not have done that, just as the state was not willing to do that,” Grebien added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A 15-year-old boy was shot and killed outside Providence Career and Technical Academy yesterday afternoon, according to the Providence Police Department. The victim, whose name has not yet been released, was a student at Central High School, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180905/central-high-student-shot-dead-outside-school-wounded-person-of-interest-found-mile-away--video">reported</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A second teenage boy was also shot and suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Police confirmed that the second victim is a person of interest in the first shooting, the Providence Journal reported. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providence Police received a call about shots fired around 2 p.m. Wednesday. The Providence Fire Department responded to the incident, transporting the first victim to Hasbro Children’s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to Providence Police. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A few minutes after the first call, police were notified that the second teenage boy was shot and wounded about a mile away from the school. He was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries to his thigh. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The incident is an active and open investigation, according to Providence Police. No further information is available about the shooter at this time. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The shooting, which transpired on the second day of school, followed a fight just outside Providence Career and Technical Academy on the corner of Westminster and Fricker streets, which neighbors both Classical and Central High Schools, the Providence Journal reported. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Providence Teachers Union announced yesterday that they will discuss their response to the shooting before classes begin Thursday, suspending their recent decision to work only the minimum number of hours specified in their contracts, according to a statement by Providence Teachers Union President Maribeth Calabro quoted in the Providence Journal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The teen is Providence’s eighth homicide victim this year, according to the Providence Journal.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Providence Police Department identified the victim of Wednesday’s shooting outside Providence Career and Technical Academy as William Parsons, a 15-year-old student at Central High School. Parsons was an “innocent bystander” in a dispute between two other teenagers, police said during a press conference Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“He was standing nearby, and we believe he was shot and killed and was not the target,” said Providence Commissioner of Public Safety Steven Paré .</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A second teenager, who is a person of interest in the original shooting, accidentally shot himself in the leg while attempting to elude Providence Police, Colonel of Providence Police Hugh Clements, Jr. announced Thursday. He was transported to Hasbro Children’s Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police confirmed Thursday that he is a juvenile enrolled in the Providence school system. His name has not been released at this time.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Clements announced that the person of interest was to be released from the hospital yesterday. Upon his release, he will be charged with murder, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Kilmartin confirmed during Thursday’s press conference.</span></p>
https://youtu.be/rJyAsF9gnfY
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In conjunction with the school department and the state, we are providing additional behavioral health, social and emotional counseling for kids throughout the day and continuing in the following days,” Mayor of Providence Jorge Elorza said at the press conference, adding that there will be expanded police presence at Providence Career and Technical Academy, Central High School and Classical High School until Friday.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Police seized a handgun Wednesday afternoon. The weapon never entered a school building. “It is unlawful for a minor under the age of 18 to possess and use any firearm or ammunition, unless he has a firearm permit and is at an approved rifle range or camp and is in the presence of a qualified adult,” according to the National Rifle Association.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Parents of local high school students gathered in front of the Providence Career and Technical Academy sign Thursday, where candles and flowers lined the school’s cement sign, which was still visibly stained with blood.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Howard Washington, a parent to two students at Central High School, is frustrated that his children were expected to return to school less than 24 hours after the tragedy.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“My question to the mayor of Providence and to the governor is ‘why did you open school today?’ It’s a school shooting, it’s a tragedy. All of our children are crying and mourning. They should be counseled at home first, Friday as well as today, and let them go into next week,” Washington told The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">Director of Communications for Providence Public Schools Laura Hart said schools opened after a discussion involving the Providence School Department, police and other educational experts that determined “it is important for students to have access to resources as soon as possible.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Parsons is Providence’s eighth homicide victim this year, according to the Providence Journal.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though Rhode Island has a history of skepticism when it comes to the utility of a lieutenant governor, candidates vying for the office in Wednesday’s primary say they can do a lot to help Rhode Island. Incumbent Lieutenant Governor Dan McKee will face current State Representative Aaron Regunberg ’12 for the Democratic <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/26/regunberg-12-run-r-lieutenant-governorship/">nomination</a>, while Paul Pence is the lone Republican candidate left in the race. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">McKee, who previously served six terms as mayor of Cumberland, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Regunberg, who has organized meetings to resist Trump-era policies, sees students at Brown and other universities as a source of strength for Rhode Island. While an undergraduate at the University, Regunberg founded the Providence Student Union to organize students across the city. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The reality is, there is a lot we can do on the state level,” he said, adding that students are often instrumental in mobilizing voters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Progressive Democrats McKee and Regunberg might seem similar at first glance, but Regunberg says that he and McKee differ on a few issues. Regunberg does not accept campaign money from corporate PACs, while McKee has accepted money from those groups, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180830/campaign-2018-mckee-regunberg-contrast-sharply-in-battle-for-ri-lt-gov--audio">according to the Providence Journal</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On issues of health care, Regunberg supports a single-payer system and has introduced legislation to create such a system, while McKee is supportive of improving the Affordable Care Act, according to the Providence Journal. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both Regunberg and McKee support codifying abortion rights into state law in case the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade. In a March interview with Rhode Island Public Radio, however, McKee said he was <a href="http://www.ripr.org/post/bonus-qa-mckee-speed-cameras-charters-fundraising-more#stream/0">unsure</a> if codifying abortion rights is constitutional. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Providence Journal reported that McKee has been endorsed by several mayors but not by Mayor of Providence Jorge Elorza, who endorsed Regunberg in <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180904/mayors-from-northern-ri-turn-out-to-back-mckee">March</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the other end of the political spectrum, Paul Pence stands alone in the race for the Republican nomination. Pence has lived in Rhode Island for 20 years and has worked in quality management and engineering throughout his life, he told The Herald. He has also published Rhode Island Roads Magazine for the last 15 years — a “life, dining, and entertainment” website, according to the site.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pence hopes to use his skills to address long lines at the DMV and reduce administrative excesses, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Often leaning towards libertarianism, Pence said he believes in small government, and added that the federal government has over-extended its reach in recent history.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Rhode Island Constitution does not outline the <a href="http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/riconstitution/Pages/Constfull.aspx">responsibilities</a> of the lieutenant governor. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If the office of the governor shall be vacant by reason of death, resignation, impeachment or inability to serve,” the lieutenant governor takes the highest executive office in RI, the state constitution says. Besides stepping in for vacancy, the Constitution does not outline specific responsibilities for the lieutenant governor. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In Rhode Island, the lieutenant governor used to preside over the state Senate, but Rhode Island legislatures amended the state Constitution in 2003 to allow state senators to elect their own president. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Over the years, a lack of specific responsibilities has led some to doubt the usefulness of the office. Robert Healey, who founded the Cool Moose Party, ran for lieutenant governor in 2010 on the platform that he would abolish the office if he was elected, <a href="https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&amp;t=pubname%3APJRI%21Providence%2BJournal%2B%2528RI%2529/year%3A2010%212010&amp;sort=YMD_date%3AA&amp;fld-base-0=alltext&amp;maxresults=20&amp;val-base-0=Robert%20healey%20cool%20moose&amp;docref=news/152423ACA696C4D8">according to the Providence Journal</a>. In 2016, a bill introduced by Tiverton’s former Republican State Sen. John Pagliarini Jr. would have abolished the position all together, and made the Secretary of State succeed the governor in case of vacancy. The bill <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText16/SenateText16/S2385.pdf">died</a> in the Senate Special Legislation and Veteran Affairs committee. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Former lieutenant governors have served on state administrative boards and worked on emergency planning, Pence said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The primary election for lieutenant governor is Wednesday.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the first week back at Brown, students on and off campus may have noticed a range of City Council electoral signs adorning peoples’ gardens. YURDIN and GAINES signs, for instance, can be seen from the corner of India Street all the way up to Fones Alley.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Providence residents will select party representatives for City Council races Wednesday, Sept. 12. Ward 1 is made up of neighborhoods including Fox Point, Wayland and parts of College Hill and downtown Providence, while the University primarily falls under the jurisdiction of Ward 2. Residents of Wards 1 and 2 will vote for their councilpeople directly in Wednesday’s party primary, since both have only Democratic candidates and no general election opponent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Providence has a total of 15 wards, and each elects one representative to City Council. The Council adopts the city’s annual budget and passes ordinances on city governance and citizen welfare. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In Ward 1, incumbent Seth Yurdin is seeking re-election for his fourth term but is challenged by community activist Justice Gaines ’16. In Ward 2, Sam Zurier previously held the seat for councilperson but announced that he would step down following the end of his second term, according to his May newsletter. Ward 2 Committee favorite Helen Anthony, attorney and member of the Providence Zoning Board, will face off against attorney Ryan Holt and Mark Feinstein, businessman and former professor at Bryant University.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The City Council itself is sort of divided,” said Gabriel Mernoff ’22 and Providence native. “Everybody’s either a moderate, middle-class interest Democrat or a really progressive working-class (Democrat).”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Ward 1</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yurdin was elected to the City Council in 2006 and again in 2010 and 2014. Yurdin said his term has been characterized by a commitment to progressive issues, referencing the time he had a “direct showdown” with former mayor David Cicilline ’83 in order to reform the Providence External Review Authority, which is a system of civilian oversight over the Providence Police Department, and his creation of the Energy and Sustainability Task Force, which aims to minimize waste and prevent pollution. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve gotten a lot of important work done on many progressive issues and also on many issues important to the neighborhood,” Yurdin said, attributing these feats to collaboration with “residents, neighborhood groups, community members, activists (and) other stakeholders.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yurdin’s challenger Gaines has also played an active role in increasing civilian involvement in the policing of the city. Gaines partnered with “City Hall and multiple politicians” to get the Providence Community-Police Relations Act passed last year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gaines graduated from Brown in 2016 and has worked with community groups Rhode Island Jobs with Justice, Direct Action for Rights and Equality and Providence Youth Student Movement. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The City Council should work to make partnerships with local businesses before looking to “bigger” and “out of state” corporations, Gaines said. She also is interested in changing the current tax code and even reducing the number of parking meters since an abundance of them may make it hard for people to frequent businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yurdin and Gaines’ positions on the Council’s Student Housing Ordinance have the power to directly influence the lives of Brown students who live off campus. Earlier this year, Yurdin proposed an amendment to a housing ordinance to ensure that no more than four undergraduate students could live together but later rescinded his support for the proposal. Nevertheless, Yurdin still warns that overpopulating buildings is an issue in Providence. It is time to revisit this housing model, Yurdin said, because current practices contribute to the housing crisis, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In reference to the Student Housing Ordinance, Gaines does not think “limiting occupancy” will address the issue of landlords flipping houses and turning them “exclusively into student housing,” since that will not address “the behaviors of developers who are just looking to make a buck off of students.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another pressing issue in the Ward 1 election race is the proposed construction of a 46-story tower downtown, which would dramatically alter Providence’s skyline. The developer of the Hope Point Tower, New York-based Jason Fane, is asking to exceed Providence’s building height limit by nearly 500 feet; Yurdin opposes the proposal since such a request ignores a “multi-year planning process” and would “dominate public space,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gaines has also opposed the construction of the tower. “We haven’t been investing in our own people. … We’ve just been waiting and trying to import investors who are mainly in it for their own profit. Bringing more of the community level of organizing, bringing the public into the decision making profit, finding solutions that are going to be creative and beneficial to our residents and prioritize them first is really what I would like to see be done in our City Council.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gaines urged Brown students to vote in the primaries because it is important that Brown students “make a decision” that will benefit the residents of Providence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Brown does become a bubble, and (Brown students) have to be able to see beyond that,” Gaines said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Ward 2</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Candidates for Ward 2 referenced the City’s finances and the relationship between universities in Providence and the city. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of the candidates in the running, attorney Anthony has the most experience in public office. She previously served on City Council in Missouri and is currently on the Providence Zoning Board.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’ve always been a community activist in everywhere I’ve lived. I’m a big believer in giving back — if you are able,” Anthony said. Anthony hopes to continue the work of her predecessor, Sam Zurier, if elected, she said. Like Zurier, who tried to pass an ordinance to bar anyone under indictment from leadership Sept. 6, Anthony encourages transparency on the part of elected officials and hopes to pass the failed legislation. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anthony zeroed in on the unfunded pension liability as a drain on the city’s resources. The pension liability is “literally strangling us over our ability to spend the money (on) what we should be spending it on, which is public education, infrastructure and services.” While she admits it is a complicated issue and is against selling or leasing to a private entity, she thinks there are some things that can be done to monetize this asset and move us out of this “critical status.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Feinstein also considers the health of the city’s finances the biggest issue. Besides addressing the pension liability, the city needs to secure money for infrastructure, obtain a tax plan that is friendly to businesses and homeowners and maintain a good relationship with universities and hospitals in Providence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Holt, a graduate of Providence College who worked on former President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012, wants to incentivize financial growth by having Providence compete with Boston and Cambridge for commercial residents, he said, and added that the city has “developable land and a talented workforce.” The status of Providence Public Schools, however, can be an obstacle for persons trying to relocate and losing people to the suburbs will negatively affect the city’s tax base, he said. Further cooperation with the universities in Providence are key to improving public schools, Holt said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Holt is committed to finding creative solutions to get the economy moving and wants to make the many undergraduate students in Providence want to stay after graduation, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Feinstein too hopes to make the city “friendlier” and “a lot more open” so that students will get to know their city “better than they do.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anthony thinks that “students and the youth” are going to unite us around these key issues. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There is nothing wrong with our city that can’t be fixed by what’s right with it. We’re just a couple of right decisions and right mayors away from Providence experiencing some growth that we haven’t experienced in generations, and I want to be part of it,” Holt said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Voters in Rhode Island’s First Congressional District will head to the polls Sept. 12 to select their candidates in the Democratic and Republican congressional primaries.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Incumbent Rep. David Cicilline ’83, D-R.I., will seek his fifth term running on a robust liberal platform that emphasizes lowering health care costs and increasing economic growth through American manufacturing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cicilline has been a rising figure in Congress, serving on the House Judiciary Committee and acting as a vocal critic of President Donald Trump’s administration. He drew media attention for his defense of recently fired FBI agent Peter Strzok, formerly an investigator for the Mueller probe.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“What we ought to be doing is protecting the special counsel’s investigation,” Cicilline said. “It’s very dangerous when you have a president and elected officials attacking the rule of law.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cicilline also hopes to continue fighting to reduce the influence of corporate capital and lobbying power in Washington, D.C. He’s taken a pledge not to accept corporate money to fund his campaign.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We need to check the pervasive influence of corruption in Washington,” Cicilline said, “in order to raise ethical standards to get the government working again for the people.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cicilline has long pushed for responsible gun control measures and climate action. He is a member of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and has introduced the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act, which would impose a fee on carbon and greenhouse emissions. Cicilline also helped prevent drilling off Rhode Island’s shores by co-sponsoring the New England Coastal Protection Act.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the tight gubernatorial race between progressive candidate Matt Brown and incumbent Gov. Gina Raimondo, Cicilline said that he will endorse Raimondo, citing the state’s economic growth and stability under her tenure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Contending against Cicilline for the Democratic nomination is Christopher Young, who ran against Cicilline in the 2016 District 1 primary and received one-third of the vote. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Young has shared conspiracy theories through his Facebook page, including one that linked Hillary Clinton to the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., as reported by the Providence Journal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Young’s campaign website states that he has been “fighting against corruption all his life.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of his top priorities is removing the federal highway tolls in Rhode Island. “I believe the tolling on federal highways is a tax and the public did not get a chance to vote on this tax impeding interstate commerce,” Young is quoted saying on his website. “Our very nation had a revolution and wrote the Declaration of Independence on this point of imposing taxes on us without our consent.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Young’s website says he also focuses on improving national security to protect against ISIS attacks on U.S. soil. Young did not respond to requests for an interview with The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the Republican party, stay-at-home father and former financial advisor Patrick Donovan runs on a platform that seeks to lower his constituents’ cost of living.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Donovan said that he would overhaul the energy system to bring in cheap renewable energy for Rhode Island. “This is power that could come to us for hundreds of years,” Donovan said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Donovan’s top priority is improving public health by reducing the amount of unused pharmaceuticals in circulation. “They are hazardous waste at this point,” Donovan said. “They are ending up in our groundwater or the ocean, and they are going in undiluted.” He worries that Rhode Island youth will experiment with them as “party drugs” if they are available.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s very straightforward: start collecting them,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Donovan supports programs offering rehabilitation for nonviolent criminals. “Work deeply with them to reintegrate them well into society so they can live a holistic life,” Donovan said. “That would lower our prison population.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While he is personally against abortion, he respects Roe v. Wade as a law, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Donovan disavows Trump’s rhetoric, he supports the administration and believes Trump has improved the country’s infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He will face off against Frederick Wysocki in the Republican primary. Wysocki could not be reached for comment and an online version of his platform could not be found before the publishing of this article.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, Daniel Guilmette, a 28-year-old truck driver, will run as a write-in, independent candidate in the November general election. While Guilmette says he voted for and supports Trump and his administration, he added that running as an independent will allow him to have the freedom to develop his own political platform.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Being an independent, it just clarifies I’m not beholden to any party or beliefs that people tell me to believe,” he said. “I am just as independent as the Constitution is, that’s what I want to protect.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Guilmette said he wants to reduce dependency in the welfare system by bolstering the state’s vocational training programs and making alternative forms of education more accessible.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We need people to make things with their hands again,” Guilmette said. “We need to start with implementing more working programs — weaning people off of welfare instead of trying to get them on welfare.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Like Donovan, Guilmette also favors criminal justice reform and hopes to promote programs or services that could help nonviolent criminals — especially drug dealers — “get cleaned up properly.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition, Guilmette is morally against abortion but acknowledged that “women have the right to do whatever they want to do with their bodies.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When it comes to environmental policy, Guilmette favors fossil fuels. A system built primarily on renewable energy would become too expensive, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The thing with these (fossil) fuels is that they are renewable in themselves — as long as the earth exists, we will always have coal, gas, oil,” he added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Incumbent Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza will face off against two primary challengers — Kobi Dennis and Robert DeRobbio — in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary. The two independents in the race, Dianne Witman and Jeffrey Lemire, will contend against the winner of the primary in the November general election.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza confirmed his re-election bid in October 2017, The Herald previously <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/26/two-candidates-make-bids-mayoral-race/">reported</a>. He assumed his position as mayor after winning the 2014 election against long-time Providence politician Vincent “Buddy” Cianci Jr. and Republican Daniel Harrop, according to the Rhode Island Board of Elections. For his first bid at re-election, Elorza is focused on continuing the work he has already accomplished, according to his campaign website.</p>
<p class="p4">David Allard, Elorza’s campaign manager, emphasized the mayor’s commitments to investing in infrastructure and Providence youth in an email to The Herald. “This type of development and investment will ensure good-paying jobs and a thriving environment in which to keep our many talented college graduates in the City of Providence after they graduate,” he wrote, adding that the campaign has a “grassroots coalition of volunteers (that) includes many high school and college students.”</p>
<p class="p4">Democratic challenger Dennis, who served in the U.S. Navy, is the director of a youth mentorship program called “Princes 2 Kings,” according to his campaign website. He has stressed the involvement of college-aged voters in his campaign, citing their work registering voters, canvassing and volunteering at events. “Their ideas and well-being have also influenced my platform positions because we all count,” Dennis wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">The effects of Trump administration policies on Providence community members weigh heavily on Dennis’ mind, he added. “Discrimination has only increased in our country with the Trump administration, and there are many additional national issues in the backdrop during this election season,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">Voters’ concerns about economic opportunity and quality of life are also at the forefront of a slate of issues Dennis hopes to address if he wins City Hall.</p>
<p class="p4">Fellow Democrat DeRobbio, a former lieutenant and captain in the U.S. Army, served as interim superintendent and later as the executive director of school support and business operations for the Providence public school system, according to his campaign website. DeRobbio hopes to improve Providence school facilities and delegate decision-making to teachers and principals. “Providence students can compete with anybody; they just need leadership that prioritizes their success,” according to the website. His platform also advocates for the legalization of marijuana and diversifying the police force. DeRobbio could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="p4">Independent challenger Witman, who has built a career in political fundraising, has served on “many boards and city commissions,” according to her campaign website.</p>
<p class="p4">Lemire could not be reached for comment and an online version of his platform could not be found before the publishing of this article.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This Wednesday will determine which two of the six contending candidates will represent the Republican and Democratic parties in the Rhode Island general gubernatorial election in November. The five independent candidates who are running in the general election will not appear on the primary ballots.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The incumbent, Gov. Gina Raimondo, is challenged by former State Representative Spencer Dickinson and former Secretary of State Matt Brown on the Democratic ballot. Among the Republicans, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung is running against former businessman and military officer Giovanni Feroce and R.I. House Minority Leader Patricia Morgan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">During the last general election in 2014, Fung lost to Raimondo with 36.3 percent of the vote to Raimondo’s 40.8 percent. A July 2018 Fleming and Associates <a href="https://media.wpri.com/nxs-wpritv-media-us-east-1/document_dev/2018/08/06/WPRI%20RWU%20July%202018%20RI%20poll%20for%20web_1533606994687_50895313_ver1.0.pdf">poll</a> projecting a face off between these two candidates measured Raimondo’s lead on Fung at 2.2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Gina Raimondo</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of two female governors in the nation, Raimondo emphasizes the gubernatorial race in both a national and local context. While Rhode Islanders prioritize “creating jobs and investing in training and education, so everyone can succeed in today’s economy,” they also perceive “risk” in this election and “want a governor who is willing to stand up against the Trump administration’s agenda,” Raimondo wrote in an email to The Herald. She cited her specific opposition to oil drilling off the R.I. coast and support for taking guns from domestic abusers as examples of her own consistent opposition to President Trump.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo hears Rhode Islanders voicing concerns most often about “creating jobs and strengthening our economy; keeping schools safe from gun violence; protecting a woman’s right to choose; defending the Affordable Care Act in Rhode Island; moving to renewable energy; investing in education; and fixing our school buildings, roads and bridges,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo describes a prosperous Rhode Island on an upward economic trajectory. “In just four years, Rhode Island has gone from having one of the highest unemployment rates in America to having the most jobs in our state’s history,” she wrote. Her campaign website states that Rhode Island’s economy has moved from 36th best economy to 17th best under her leadership, though some of her opponents highlight that this year, Rhode Island’s position slid from 9th best in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/state-economy-ranking-q1-2018-2">first quarter</a> to 17th in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/state-economy-ranking-q2-2018-2018-6">second quarter</a>, according to Business Insider. There are more Rhode Islanders working now than in each of the past 10 years, and the state is number one for rising wages, according to the campaign website.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Additionally, Raimondo aims to make R.I. energy “10 times cleaner” by 2020, according to her website. Green energy jobs have increased 66 percent during her time in office. Raimondo has faced criticism for endorsing a controversial construction project by the energy company Invenergy to build a $1 billion power plant in Burrillville that would burn natural gas. The project was <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180820/century-old-state-law-may-decide-case-involving-invenergy-burrillville-johnston-and-future-of-energy-in-rhode-island">taken to court</a> by the Conservation Law Foundation, and the case will be decided at the end of this month. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo has received endorsements from the Democratic Party, Planned Parenthood and several unions, including the local chapters of the Service Employees International, Allied Craftsmen and Iron Workers and Bricklayers unions. She currently holds over <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/tools/election-overview?s=RI&amp;y=2018">$4 million</a> in campaign funds, according to Followthemoney.org. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Half of Rhode Islanders view Raimondo positively, according to a February WPRI/RWU <a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/eyewitness-news-investigates/wpri-12-rwu-poll-march-2018/1082562323">poll</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Spencer Dickinson</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For Dickinson, the issues at stake in this race are “overwhelmingly local,” he said. Dickinson represented Rhode Island’s 35th district in the State Congress from 1973 to 1980 and again from 2010 to 2014. While Dickinson’s campaign also emphasizes health care, women’s rights, education and infrastructure, he opposes the Burrillville power plant. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In summary of his viewpoints, Dickinson charged that “the one underlying issue is the competence of the governor.” Dickinson criticized infrastructural and “administrative failures,” which waste government money. As an example, he referred to the RhodeWorks Tolling Program, a project to fund road and bridge construction through truck tolls. The program cycled too much money out of state by paying an externally based company to photograph license plates, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The risk of Providence going bankrupt constitutes “probably one of the biggest threats to the state of Rhode Island right now, to Providence or Brown (University) or anybody else,” Dickinson said. Providence faces an enormous pension deficit, The Herald previously <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/04/elorza-reiterates-call-lease-providence-water-supply-board/">reported</a>. Like Mayor Jorge Elorza, Dickinson favors leasing Providence’s water supply, which provides water to two-thirds of Rhode Island, to fund the deficit. Dickinson said that the water supply was a billion-dollar asset, and thus should generate more revenue than the $404.2 million at which it has been <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3921588-Final-Report-Valuation-Providence-Water-Supply.html">valued</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dickinson expressed concern about the distortion of politics by big money. “We are at risk today in this country of having money, big money, take over our governing process. I think it’s probably already happened,” Dickinson said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Matt Brown</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown is a former R.I. Secretary of State and co-founder of the nonprofit Global Zero, which opposes nuclear weapons. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The system that we have is broken,” Brown said, and it can only be fixed by “fundamental changes (that) tackle economic inequality, the environment and the corruption of politics with money.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rather than consider GDP or stock market metrics, “I measure the economy by how people are doing in their daily lives,” Brown said. “Everything, in the end, is local.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown emphasized that people are struggling. “The economic fact that matters to people is that the cost of the things people need — health care, housing, college — have gone through the roof for four years, and they’re still going through the roof. And wages have stayed essentially the same,” he said. He underscored the need for more affordable housing and a better climate for small businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When it comes to the environment, there are no technological or cost barriers to promote clean energy sources, Brown said. “The costs are dropping so fast it’s almost hard to keep up — both solar and wind.” He added that “the barrier is political leadership, and I intend to bring it.” Brown opposes the Burrillville power plant and “all new fossil fuel infrastructure.” His goal is to have Rhode Island fueled by 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. Raimondo’s approach, he said, is “just not at the scale of the problem that we’re facing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown intends to combine his policy priorities of economy and environment to build a green energy economy “that would create 11,000 jobs that can never be outsourced because they’re tied to the Rhode Island landscape.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Campaign sparring between Brown and Raimondo has been especially bitter. Raimondo’s campaign advertisements attacking Brown have highlighted a 2006 charge that Brown violated campaign contribution limits while running for R.I. senator, a charge Dickinson repeated. On Tuesday, Brown <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/politics/new-brown-issues-cease-desist-letter-to-raimondo">filed</a> a cease-and-desist letter stating that all of these charges were dismissed by 2007. He called these and other allegations about his financial history “absurd false attacks.” He has criticized Raimondo for “refusing to do one debate.” Raimondo declined to participate in a round-table debate because Brown “lies,” she said in an interview with the Providence Journal. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown was <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Rhode_Island_gubernatorial_election,_2018_(September_12_Democratic_primary)">endorsed</a> by progressive groups including Our Revolution RI and Justice Democrats.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Allan Fung</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung paints a pessimistic picture of the state’s economic climate. His campaign website claims that Rhode Island is the worst in the country for job opportunities. He proposes cutting taxes and adopting various measures implemented in Cranston at the state level, including the establishment of legislature term limits and a Business Concierge Program intended to make Rhode Island more accommodating to new businesses. Fung would also increase the authority of the governor’s office by introducing the line-item veto and adding an Inspector General office as a check on the executive, according to his website.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung’s platform also stresses attention to Rhode Island’s veterans, and he advocates for making military pensions tax-exempt. “As Mayor, (Fung) has been at the forefront of listening to, and caring for his local veterans,” according to a campaign release, which further specified that Cranston was the first community to exempt disabled veterans from paying property taxes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While Fung has, at one point, described himself as pro-choice, he has converted to Catholicism and supports “certain common-sense restrictions, … while still respecting a woman’s right to make a medical decision,” he <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180903/evolving-answers-on-major-issues-hallmark-of-fungs-campaign-for-governor">told</a> the Providence Journal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He does not support late-term abortions. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung’s stance on gun control has evolved during his time as a civil servant. In 2004, as a Cranston City Council member, he voted for a resolution that called upon Congress to renew a ban on assault weapons. He now does not support a complete ban on assault weapons, according to the Providence Journal. Fung supports the right of “law abiding citizens to own a firearm,” and he shoots recreationally. He attributed the issue of gun violence to criminals and advocates for heavier sentencing, according to the Providence Journal. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung has been endorsed by the Rhode Island Republican party. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He could not be reached for comment by press time.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Giovanni Feroce</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The single most important issue to voters this election season is “leadership,” Feroce wrote in an email to The Herald. Feroce feels qualified to be governor through his experiences in “business, politics and the military,” he said. The former state senator has also served as CEO of the jewelry company Alex and Ani and the watch company Benrus, The Herald previously <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/28/giovanni-feroce-joins-rhode-island-gubernatorial-race-candidates/">reported</a>. In 2017, he was banned by Benrus and sued by creditors, including the Internal Revenue Service, when he could not meet the company’s owed payments, according to the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171129/feroce-banned-from-running-benrus?">Providence Journal</a>. The Journal reported that Benrus has experienced financial struggles in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Feroce proposes that Rhode Island’s economy shift to revolve around Boston. Since “the current R.I. economy lacks in-state opportunities,” Rhode Islanders would be better served by an administration that prioritizes “transportation, infrastructure and housing concepts that are affordable, flexible and technologically advanced” — allowing graduates to live in Rhode Island and commute “to high-paying jobs in and around Boston,” Feroce wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Additionally, Feroce hopes to focus the R.I. economy on technological development, specifically in <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/">blockchain</a>, a technology originally designed for trading Bitcoin that serves as a distributed ledger for storing information. “Rhode Island can lead the nation, economically and technologically, by becoming the ‘Silicon Valley’ or ‘Route 128’ for the greatest technological breakthrough since the invention of the World Wide Web: the blockchain,” Feroce wrote. He specified instituting education, a welcoming business climate and the governmental adoption of the blockchain infrastructure as necessary measures to realize this vision for the state.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Feroce opposes the construction of the Burrillville power plant, he wrote. He opposes gun control, according to the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180831/feroce-hopes-ris-gop-voters-will-swing-for-fences-with-him">Journal</a>. He would not sign the Reproductive Care Act but does not favor a ban on abortion, according to the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180628/where-they-stand-candidates-on-reproductive-health-care-act">Journal</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Feroce has been <a href="https://www.rirelevant.com/politics/giovanni-feroce-wins-endorsement-burrillville-gop-town-committee/ add endorsements?">endorsed</a> by the Burrillville Republican Town Committee.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Patricia Morgan</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elected the first female minority leader in the R.I. State House last year, Morgan believes that “most people are concerned about the poor performance of our state’s economy” and that Rhode Island is not on par with national economic growth, she wrote in an email to The Herald, adding that the current approach has led it to be “first in and last out of every recession.” She dismissed the drop in unemployment figures as stemming from the creation of “part-time and temporary jobs” and lamented that Rhode Island has the third highest rate of attrition for college graduates. She would “offer tax credits to employers that establish a plan to help (graduates) pay their college loans,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Morgan is also in favor of the creation of an Inspector General office to improve government oversight. She would expand tax cuts, including on social security, and also hopes to improve access to healthcare. Morgan is pro-life and supports increasing access to contraceptives, according to the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180628/where-they-stand-candidates-on-reproductive-health-care-act">Journal</a>. She describes herself as an advocate for Second Amendment rights and has suggested taking steps to make school facilities more secure, according to the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180904/campaign-2018-patricia-morgan-targets-bureaucracy-in-gop-primary-for-governor">Journal</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Morgan has been <a href="http://rirepublicans.us/event/endorsement-of-patricia-morgan-for-governor-by-w-warwick/">endorsed</a> by the West Warwick Republican Town Committee.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Sept. 12 primaries for an open U.S. Senate seat in Rhode Island are fast approaching as both Democratic and Republican candidates attempt to catch their party’s nomination and position themselves to defeat incumbent Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. Gearing up to challenge Whitehouse in the Democratic primaries is Hopkinton native Pat Fontes, while Roque De La Fuente and Robert Flanders ’71 compete for the Republican nomination. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the Democratic side of the primary, Whitehouse, a well-funded and widely known incumbent, is challenged by Fontes, an esoteric anti-war advocate. For the Republicans, a California native and career candidate De La Fuente attempts to defeat a respected former R.I. Supreme Court Judge, Flanders. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The disparities between candidates is well represented in the amount of money they’ve raised. Whitehouse has raised almost $5 million, and Flanders follows with around $605,000, according to <a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/tools/election-overview?s=RI&amp;y=2018">Followthemoney.org</a>. Fontes and De La Fuente have yet to raise any money. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>The Democrats </b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whitehouse has held the Senate seat since 2007, serving before as the Attorney General of Rhode Island. On the Senate, he serves on the Budget, Environment and Public Works, Judiciary and Finance committees. He has been an outspoken critic of President Trump and has been vocal about climate change. “I’ve been leading the charge in the Senate to reduce carbon emissions and promote clean energy,” Whitehouse wrote in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m hopeful that America will, sooner rather than later, resume its international leadership on climate change. It’s unlikely to happen while President Trump is in office and Republicans control Congress, but it’s too important for our economy and way of life for the United States to fall behind the rest of the world,” Whitehouse wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With regard to student issues, Whitehouse worked to keep the Affordable Care Act intact, which, among other things, allows young people to stay on their parents insurance until they’re 26. “I’m also working to make sure graduates will enter an economy where they’ll be able to find a good job that can support a family, and that women will be paid fairly for their work,” Whitehouse wrote. He has also expanded the federal student loan forgiveness program to lessen the debt of those graduates who choose a career in the public sector. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unlike the career politician Whitehouse, Fontes is an 81-year-old activist who, while aware of the unlikelihood of victory in the race, hopes to draw attention to the issues of American involvement in war and the environment because Whitehouse is “failing” in those areas, she said. Fontes took issue with Whitehouse’s vote in favor of the fiscal year 2018 military budget, which was $37 billion larger than President Trump pushed for, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/us/politics/senate-pentagon-spending-bill.html">as reported</a> by the New York Times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also voted against an amendment that would end the 2001 and 2002 Authorizations for the Use of Military Force, which would have been an important step to limiting the president’s war powers, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00195">Fontes said</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fontes prioritizes bringing a sense of morality back to politics and everyday life. “We talk a lot about American values, but I’m not so sure of what those values are besides make as many bucks as you can,” Fontes said. Rebuilding consideration for others is a priority of her campaign, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She also has expressed a desire for a “fair tax plan” in which the wealthy pay a larger marginal income tax.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I grew up knowing what life is like in a society where the excessively rich pay their fair share of the taxes,” she said. Fontes doesn’t see a return to that as being impossible. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fontes’ campaign also centers around social justice. Social justice to Fontes means “things most associated with anti-poverty… universal healthcare, retirement security — which is a code word for not letting them destroy social security — and free college education,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fontes said Brown students should vote for her “because they’re the people with the families that are going to live in the society with endless wars and the breaking-down environment.” But “even in this situation where I am almost certainly going to lose,” Fontes said, “we’ve learned a lot from, and I hope young people will learn from, what we did and what we didn’t do.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Republican Candidates </b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the right side of the aisle, the contrast between candidates is stark, and the race has involved a battle in court. De La Fuente, who goes by “Rocky,” is a car dealer and real estate developer currently residing in California. Although a registered Republican, he ran as a Democrat in the 2016 presidential election, and after failing to receive any delegates in the primaries, founded the American Delta Party to allow him to run in the general election. He received <a href="https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/federalelections2016.pdf">0.02 percent</a> of the total popular vote, according to the Federal Elections Commision. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the U.S. Senate primaries, De La Fuente is currently running for Senate in seven states: Rhode Island, Florida, Hawaii, Minnesota, Vermont, Washington and Wyoming. He has already been defeated as candidate for U.S. Senate in California. De La Fuente claims this strategy is legal as long as he is living in whatever state he is elected to before he is sworn in. De La Fuente is a spokesman against election fraud, and has centered his multiple campaigns around his Hispanic heritage, his career as a businessman and the issues of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>campaign finance reform and comprehensive immigration reform. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a press release, De La Fuente declares his intention to run in the primary in Rhode Island, <a href="https://vote.rocky101.com/en_us/">stating</a>, “he hopes to impress voters with his background as a successful entrepreneur in a multitude of businesses spread across the world … he is confident that his Hispanic heritage and his record as a champion of equality will lure the minority vote in his favor.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His opponent Bob Flanders, a Rhode Island resident, challenged De La Fuente’s ability to run in the state, arguing in front of the R.I. Board of Elections that De La Fuente shouldn’t be eligible to run in the primary because he is not a “qualified voter” in Rhode Island. But the challenge was overturned under the ruling that a state cannot impose any requirements for running that go beyond those set out by the U.S. Constitution. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of his opponent, Flanders said “he seems to be some sort of a gadfly, I don’t know if he’s ever been to Rhode Island, or even knows where it is.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Flanders, a University alum, is running as an “independent-minded Republican” who can work across the aisle. “I’m running on the idea that what we need most in Washington are people who are problem solvers who can work with both Democrats and Republicans, and even independents, to get things done,” he said. His policy priorities include healthcare, drug pricing, infrastructure and immigration. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While support of Trump has certainly been a lightning rod issue for candidates in these midterm elections, Flanders said he will not reflexively support all of the President’s actions. Though he is not convinced there are grounds to impeach the president as of yet, he remains supportive of the Mueller investigation and is open to the idea if new information is uncovered. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m going to call balls and strikes on (Trump) and make judgements about whether what he’s doing or saying or acting on are in the interest of Rhode Island and act accordingly.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Senator Whitehouse, his biggest criticism is that the sitting senator is a one-issue candidate, focusing too much on climate change and not on the problems that concern most Rhode Islanders. Flanders remains skeptical of human impact on climate change and its effect on the state. “I think it’s a stretch to say Rhode Island is going to be subsumed or overrun by tidal changes and rising tides,” Flanders said. “The temperature rises and sea level rises are not that different frankly, from what’s happened in the past.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But when it comes to student issues, Flanders shares some stances on issues with Whitehouse. He intends to consider some policies that would help mitigate “burdensome” student loan debts and hold some institutions of higher learning, especially for-profit colleges, responsible when they fail to deliver on their promises and leave students saddled with enormous debts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When asked why Brown students should vote for him, Flanders responded, “I would hope Brown students are like the rest of the population, and would like people who can work together and not be hyper-partisan. We need people who are problem solvers and not bomb throwers.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Protestors march on WaterFire against National Grid proposal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Armed with a projector and determination, protesters marched to WaterFire Saturday night in opposition to National Grid’s proposal to build a liquefied natural gas processing facility in the Port of Providence. WaterFire is sponsored by National Grid.</p>
<p class="p1">As the festivities kicked off, protesters stood over Crawford Street Bridge carrying signs with slogans like “#nonationalgreed.” A projector flashed phrases onto the bridge such as “The climate crisis, sponsored by National Grid” and “Dirty LNG in South Providence, sponsored by National Grid.”</p>
<p class="p1">Protesters, organized by an affiliate of 350.org called Climate Action Rhode Island, highlighted environmental and sociological consequences of the proposed LNG facility, which would store natural gas, said Lauren Niedel-Gresh, a member of Climate Action Rhode Island. Federal regulators cleared the proposal in July and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission final decision could take on the project this month, according to the Providence Journal.</p>
<p class="p1">Environmental advocates spoke about the ramifications of fracked gas infrastructure like an LNG facility.</p>
<p class="p1">“We have to move to a fully renewable energy within the next 25 years, or we are going to bake this planet after that,” Niedel-Gresh told The Herald.</p>
<p class="p1">“My goal in life is to leave the environment in far better condition than I found it in because it is incredibly unfair to dump environmental problems on the generations to come,” said Alex Duryea, a Nature’s Trust Rhode Island petitioner and master’s student at University of Rhode Island at the pre-march rally at Roger Williams Monument Park.</p>
<p class="p1">Advocates for racial and economic equality also highlighted the social impact of building an LNG facility in South Providence — an area “plagued with environmental racism,” Niedel-Gresh said, adding that the community surrounding the proposed facility is already contaminated with air and water pollutants.</p>
<p class="p1">“We’re demanding a publicly owned utility — and a publicly owned utility that is democratically controlled,” said Anna Brennan of the Providence Democratic Socialists of America.</p>
<p class="p1">Brennan’s group was also protesting Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s recent approval of National Grid’s request to increase electric rates by about 3.5 percent, which amounts to about $3.67 per month per customer, according to the commission’s press release. The commission also approved a request to decrease the average rate of gas for residents by 0.9 percent.</p>

&nbsp;
<p class="p1">Monica Huertas, campaign coordinator of No LNG in PVD, reminded protesters of the importance of including those most affected by the proposal in their advocacy work.</p>
<p class="p1">“We in South Providence have really just the bottom of the barrel stuff — dirty, dirty oil and gas and just really just nasty things,” she said at the rally before reminding listeners that “you can’t do this without black or brown people. You have to make the space for us.”</p>
<p class="p1">Democratic gubernatorial candidate Matt Brown cheered on protesters as they marched from Roger Williams Monument Park to WaterFire.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s 2018. We need to be having no new fossil fuel burning at all, no new fossil fuel infrastructure,” Brown told The Herald.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A new study by University researchers confirmed that it is possible for household lead levels to be reduced more substantially than the Environmental Protection Agency currently mandates. The study follows Providence Water’s 2017 annual report, which revealed that Providence’s water exceeds the lead level guidelines set by the EPA. The University is currently testing water<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>samples from campus buildings to see if they exceed EPA standards for drinking water for the first time since 2008, according to Director of Environmental Health and Safety Stephen Morin. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>University study on household lead levels</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Published in JAMA Pediatrics Aug. 27, the new study looked at 355 pregnant women and their children in Cincinnati from 2003 to the present. The research team implemented lead remediation techniques in the homes of about half of the women — including removing and replacing chipped lead paint and lead-painted window sills, installing lead-removing water filters and covering lead-contaminated soil with groundcover. The other half, the control group, received baby gates and injury prevention devices to prevent infants from direct exposure to lead. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">While the researchers were unable to find a significant difference in blood lead levels among the wider group that received lead remediation intervention, there was a 31 percent reduction in lead levels among black children. Joseph Braun, associate professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health and lead author of the study, is unsure why black children saw the largest improvement after treatment. Because black children are often exposed to a higher level of lead, the preventative measures may have made a larger impact, he said. Braun added that he is interested in conducting additional research about the relationship between income and lead exposure.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The study could help push the EPA to strengthen their guidelines for household lead levels, as it showed that achieving lower lead levels is possible, Braun said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In addition to blood testing, the study looked at children’s behavior from one to eight years old. The only significant behavioral improvement between the control and treatment groups was a reduction in anxiety, Braun said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Going forward, Braun said he would like to examine which types of remediation are most effective in reducing lead levels and explore the difference between lead exposure from water compared to dust.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Lead in Rhode Island</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In Rhode Island, lead from dust and water are perennial issues. According to the Rhode Island Department of Health, 80 percent of homes in the state were built before 1978 and therefore contain a high level of lead paint. The state has exceeded the EPA’s recommended lead levels in the water “10 times or more” in the last 25 years, the Associated Press reported. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In the last decade, Providence Water has spent over $45 million mitigating lead damage, according to an Aug. 31 press release from the city utility company.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Providence Water continues to evaluate our water treatment process to make the water less corrosive in an effort to reduce lead levels in homes that may have lead plumbing,” the statement read.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In Providence, both the 2016 and 2017 water quality reports showed lead exceedances above the EPA standards.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“It’s disturbing, but not at all surprising,” said Laura Brion ’04, executive director of Childhood Lead Action Project.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Brion, who advocates for lead safety in the state, said that Providence Water recently notified her that her office building in Federal Hill may have lead service lines. The Herald’s building at 195 Angell St. also received one of these notifications. Providence Water has placed the report in public locations, including the Sciences Library. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“I’m glad that Providence is reporting it out and that people are noticing it,” Brion said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Providence Water’s brochures and letters, written in English and Spanish, encourage Providence Water customers to stop by their offices to pick up free water-testing kits. The literature also describes Providence Water’s no-interest, three-year loan program that provides loans for homeowners to replace private lead pipes with the guarantee that the company will replace the public lines.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Looking Forward</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">While headlines about lead, including those about Flint, Michigan, can ignite public concern, a lot has already been done to lower lead exposure, according to David Savitz, associate director of the Brown Center for the Study of Children at Risk and professor of epidemiology, pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Levels that we’re concerned about (now), 10 years ago, we would have been happy about,” Savitz said, adding that with regulations such as removing lead from gasoline, the EPA has been able to gradually lower lead levels and make lead guidelines stricter.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“They set standards to be practical,” Savitz said, adding that no level of lead is known to be safe.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Interventions usually make subtler differences because lead levels are already generally much lower than before, he said, pointing to the study’s findings that black participants benefitted most from the remediation techniques while the group as a whole did not show significant reduction in blood lead levels. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">But lead levels can always be lower, Savitz said, adding that Providence Water “certainly needs to lower levels to be in compliance” with EPA regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Still, Savitz urged people not to panic about general low-level lead exposures in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“We’re concerned (about lead levels), not conveying a sense of terror,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Updated Sept. 13 at 9:44 p.m.</strong>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over 144,000 Rhode Islanders cast their votes yesterday in the primary elections, according to the <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/RI_BOE/status/1040030410535841797?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">R.I. Board of Elections</a>. Nominees for the Democratic and Republican parties have been chosen for the general election at both the federal and state levels.</span></p>
&nbsp;

https://youtu.be/qIBfGYrmwHs
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Incumbent Gov. Gina Raimondo defeated Matt Brown and Spencer Dickinson in a landslide for the Democratic nomination for governor with 57.2 percent of the vote, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/12/us/elections/results-rhode-island-primary-elections.html">New York Times</a>. Brown received 33.5 percent of the vote, while Dickinson received 9.3 percent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mayor of Cranston Allan Fung defeated Patricia Morgan and Giovanni Feroce for the Republican nomination for governor with 56.4 percent of the vote to Morgan’s 40.1 percent and Feroce’s 3.5 percent, according to the Times. A four-term mayor known for his fiscal reform, Fung is running on a platform that aims to cut down on corruption and strengthen work requirements for welfare recipients, according to his <a href="https://www.allanfung.com/we-can-do-better/">campaign website</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You know what this means — get up tomorrow and work even harder,” Raimondo said during her acceptance speech. “November is around the corner, and I am fired up! Because we have a real race ahead of us.” Raimondo reminded voters that Fung opposes her administration’s job-creation policies and would not have the courage to stand up to President Trump.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 2014 gubernatorial election, Fung narrowly lost to Raimondo, but current polls show them evenly matched this time around, <a href="https://www.wpri.com/politics/wpri-12rwu-poll-raimondo-fung-still-in-tight-race-for-ri-governor/1349587973">according to WPRI</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Tonight, all of you have spoken loudly and clearly that you are ready to take back our state from the insiders, the big shots, the connected,” Fung said in his acceptance speech to cheers. “The hard-working Rhode Islander is going to be at the front and center of every decision we make. You need a break.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his concession speech, Brown pledged to support Raimondo in her re-election campaign. “We were outspent 13 to one. I wouldn’t have done it different,” Brown told The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The race for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor was hotly contested. Incumbent Daniel McKee pulled off the win with 57,343 votes to the 54,955 garnered by Aaron Regunberg ’12, <a href="https://t.co/ldjcQ6gU20">according to WPRI</a>. Paul Pence won the Republican nomination uncontested.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Incumbent Mayor Jorge Elorza handily gained the Democratic nomination for mayor of Providence with 58.6 percent of the vote with 99 percent of precincts reporting by press time, according to WPRI. Elorza defeated community activist Kobi Dennis and nonprofit president Robert DeRobbio, who received 24.2 percent and 17.2 percent, respectively. Dramatically out-fundraising his opponents, Elorza assured voters he would focus on finding a sustainable solution for Providence’s $2 billion financial obligations, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180827/race-for-providence-city-hall">according to the Providence Journal</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the race for U.S. Senate, incumbent Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., secured the Democratic nomination with 76.8 percent of the vote against 81-year-old activist Patricia Fontes, according to the Times. Whitehouse has built a reputation as a leader of climate-change reform in the Senate and as a vocal critic of the Trump administration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the Republican nomination, Robert Flanders ’71 defeated Roque De La Fuente with 87.7 percent of the vote, according to the Times. In his campaign, Flanders has promised to put the state above partisan politics and to be unafraid to speak his mind. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Two U.S. House seats were on the ballot yesterday, and incumbent Rep. David Cicilline ’83, D-R.I., bested Christopher Young for the Democratic nomination for House District 1 with 77.9 percent of the vote and 99 percent of precincts reporting as of press time, according to the Times. Patrick Donovan defeated Frederick Wysocki for the Republican nomination with 78.3 percent of the vote and 99 percent of precincts reporting as of press time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For House District 2, both Republican Salvatore Caiozzo and incumbent Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., ran uncontested. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of the 38 state Senate seats up for grabs, only 13 of the nominations were contested. In the state House primary, which had 75 seats up for election, 20 nominations were contested.</span></p>
In the races for seats on the Providence City Council, incumbent Councilman Seth Yurdin secured 64.6 percent of the vote over Justice Gaines in Ward 1. In the open seat in Ward 2, Helen Anthony edged out Ryan Holt and Mark Feinstein with 65.7 percent of the vote.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Peter Neronha received the Democratic nomination for attorney general uncontested. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the general treasurer race, incumbent Seth Magaziner received the Democratic nomination, and Michael Riley won the Republican nomination, both uncontested. Both candidates for secretary of state also ran uncontested, with incumbent Nellie Gorbea receiving the Democratic nomination and Pat Cortellessa garnering the Republican nomination.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rhode Island bans vaping in public spaces</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Rhode Island joined 13 other states in prohibiting the use of e-cigarettes and similar vaping devices in most enclosed public spaces after a bill was signed into law by Gov. Gina Raimondo this July. Advocates of this effort cited health concerns that secondhand vapor poses for the general public, said bill co-sponsor and R.I. Senator and Senate Committee on Health and Human Services Chairman Joshua Miller, D-Cranston, Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The legislation — which increases the reach of Rhode Island’s 2005 workplace smoking ban — prohibits the use of e-cigarettes and other vaporizers in spaces including “private businesses, restaurants, most bars (and) public restrooms,” according to the Senate’s press release.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It has been discussed … whether the impacts of (e-cigarettes) overall was a positive or negative,” Miller said. “A consensus has been reached by those who are both advocates of legislators and health advocates that there’s enough negatives in (e-cigarettes) to warrant further legislation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The e-cigarette — a small smoking device that heats up a liquid composed of nicotine and other additives — has been on the market for over ten years but has just recently gained popularity in the past five years, said Jennifer Tidey, professor of behavioral and social sciences and psychiatry and human hehavior. This new technology has been widely utilized as a safer alternative to smoking combustible cigarettes, and many of these users have an end goal of quitting smoking entirely, Tidey added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, Tidey notes that while e-cigarettes are “much less risky” than traditional cigarettes, they are not entirely “risk free.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think banning (e-cigarrettes) indoors is appropriate,” Tidey said, noting the lack of sufficient research on the risks of e-cigarette vapor exposure to those who are pregnant, elderly or asthmatic. “When we think about it, we have to think about these special populations who are vulnerable.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">New research — such as in the January “Public Health Consequences of E-Cigarettes” report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — indicates there are other toxins present in the use of e-cigarettes. While the quantities of these materials are “mostly” small, there are emissions of propylene glycol, which may damage the respiratory system when inhaled, and e-cigarette vapor contains traces of heavy metals such as nickel and chromium, which are linked to diseases such as cancer, said Professor of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Medicine Jasjit S. Ahluwalia.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Preliminary research has found toxic substances in e-cigarette vapor, Ahluwalia said, adding that Rhode Islands’ e-cigarette bill follows a greater nationwide trend to legally treat e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes the same way.</span></p>
<p class="p4">In addition to the health risks of e-cigarettes to the general public, there is concern among some experts that e-cigarettes are a “gateway drug” to combustible cigarettes and other drugs, Ahluwalia said. But the evidence for this is mixed, he added. The Food and Drug Administration addressed that concern Wednesday when it sent over 1,300 warning letters and fines to e-cigarette manufacturers demanding that youth sales decline within 60 days, according to a Sept. 12 FDA press release.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Miller considers this growing alarm surrounding youth e-cigarette usage as another reason to keep e-cigarettes out of public places.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yet Miller admits that enforcing the ban on e-cigarettes is “a little more complicated” than regulating combustible cigarettes, since it is not as easy to identify someone smoking an e-cigarette — which omits a vapor that quickly dissipates. He notes that formally restricting e-cigarettes is an important step nonetheless.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the Providence Place Mall, the security procedures adhere to the bill’s guidelines. </span></p>
<p class="p4">“We treat (e-cigarettes) just like cigarettes,” said Senior General Manager of Providence Place Mark Dunbar. “We have it on our rules of conduct, and we deal with it accordingly,” adding that a patron using an e-cigarette at Providence Place would be asked to “put it out” or “leave the property” just as they would if they had been using a combustible cigarette.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The use of e-cigarettes continues to be a contentious issue among researchers, Tidey said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The School of Public Health is currently conducting research on e-cigarette usage as a means of mitigating cigarette addiction — which includes a lab study on adolescent users and studies on long-term smokers with psychiatric disorders and smokers with HIV. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tidey, while a proponent of the legislation, does warn against conflating e-cigarette users with traditional cigarette smokers. In cases where public spaces may have a designated space to smoke, a user of e-cigarettes with the goal of quitting smoking could have a relapse when exposed to “all the cues” of smoking, she said. E-cigarette users should ideally have their own space, and she added that stigmatizing e-cigarettes must be avoided given their role in kicking cigarette addictions.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bike share program comes to Providence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">As classes kicked off this semester, so did JUMP Electric Bikes — a new bike-share program that brings hundreds of red dockless bikes to Providence. Uber, which purchased JUMP Bikes in spring 2018, and the City of Providence partnered to allow community members to rent bikes through the Uber or JUMP Bike apps.</p>
<p class="p4">To rent a bike, users can select any of the small bike icons on either app to find a charged bike nearby. Once the JUMP Bike is reserved, the app provides a pin to unlock the bike’s built-in lock. After each use, the bikes are either returned to a JUMP Bike hub — such as the one in front of Metcalf Research Building on Thayer Street — or to a public bike rack, a streetlight pole or another public spot.</p>
<p class="p4">There are multiple ways to pay for the service. Riders can decide to pay $2 for 30 minutes of riding, and then pay by the minute, or pay $20 per month for an hour of riding each day. There is also a $5 per hour option for participants in initiatives such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or the Free or Reduced Price School Lunch program.</p>
<p class="p4">Launched Sept. 6, JUMP Bikes’ arrival follows seven years of talks about introducing a bike-share program to the city, according to Ben Smith, deputy director of communications for Mayor Jorge Elorza.</p>
<p class="p4">“JUMP e-assist bikes position Providence to be a more sustainable, healthier and fun city for years to come,” Smith wrote in an email to The Herald. “They are incredibly powerful tools that provide residents and visitors with accessible, affordable transportation options.”</p>
<p class="p4">Co-President of Bikes at Brown Harry August ’19 purchased a month-long subscription to the service.</p>
<p class="p4">“I love (JUMP Bikes). They’re just really fun to ride around,” he said, adding that he has not had to walk “more than a few blocks” to find a bike since the program’s inception.</p>
<p class="p4">Assistant Vice President of Government and Community Relations Al Dahlberg sat on the University’s internal task force of students, faculty and staff that advised the city on the bike share initiative. According to Dahlberg, the dockless feature of the bike-share is one of the system’s “key advantages.” He also highlighted the bike’s electric pedal-assist — which gives riders trekking up Providence’s many hills an extra 20mph boost.</p>
<p class="p4">The University’s internal task force spoke with the City of Providence about issues of “cost, safety and convenience” and also pinpointed spots on campus where hubs should be stationed, Dahlberg said.</p>
<p class="p4">“Brown supports bike share because it offers another means of mobility for our community,” Dahlberg said. “We want to see the program succeed and benefit all areas of Providence.”</p>
<p class="p4">Rhode Island School of Design and Rhode Island Public Transportation Association, among other Providence-based organizations, were involved in the planning process.</p>
<p class="p4">After a review of proposals received in the Request For Proposal process, the City awarded the contract to Social Bicycles, which later changed its name to JUMP, Smith wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">Smith added that they “explored many bike share programs that exist in other U.S. cities as models” and ultimately chose to invest $400,000 in federal grant funds to Social Bicycles. Lifespan and Tufts Health Plan sponsored the project.</p>
<p class="p4">As of Sept. 15, there were 400 JUMP Bikes in Providence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Just UnDo It: North Smithfield considers reversing Nike ban</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following public outcry, the Town Council of North Smithfield in Providence Country, Rhode Island, will vote Sept. 24 on whether or not to recall a recent municipal nonbinding ban of Nike products, according to a press release issued Wednesday by Council President John Beauregard. Beauregard proposed the “Nike Resolution” — passed 3 to 2 Sept. 17 — as a response against the company’s advertising campaign featuring former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality against people of color.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Nike’s decision … is an insult and slap in the face to the hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officers throughout this country,” the resolution stated, while citing the 102 police officers killed on duty in the United States so far this year. The resolution requests that the municipality — including schools and police departments — refrain from purchasing Nike products. North Smithfield has no active orders with Nike, according to Town Administrator Gary Ezovski.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The vote Monday could fully repeal the resolution.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I am not doing this because my views on the subject have changed,” wrote Beauregard, who worked as a state trooper for 25 years. “I am only doing this because of the backlash to my town, the businesses in my town, the schools and all the residents. I don’t want to drag anyone into my fight that did not choose to be in it.” He added that “this resolution had nothing to do with race.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Public condemnation began Monday at the Town Council meeting, where many attendees accused Beauregard and the Town Council of racial insensitivity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The R.I.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>American Civil Liberties Union and the Providence Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People also issued statements rebuking the resolution.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The message that is sent is that the town of North Smithfield does not care about police brutality and racial inequality,” NAACP Providence President Jim Vincent told The Herald. “They do not care about issues that affect people of color.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s also political grandstanding,” Vincent added. “Using a town council to express your personal views is just an abuse of power and a waste of taxpayers time and money.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have so many prominent issues to deal with. … Frankly, spending time on this (Nike Resolution) is asinine,” said North Smithfield School Committee Member Arthur Bassett during the Town Council meeting Monday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have worked too hard to let anything compromise our community values or to let anything distract us from working towards what’s best for our students, and that’s what we as a School Committee will continue to do,” wrote School Committee Member Jean Meo in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">North Smithfield is not the first place to ban Nike products — the town of Kenner, Louisiana and the Mississippi police force have also passed similar resolutions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We can only hope that a town as far away from the Mason-Dixon line as North Smithfield, Rhode Island will not be the third,” R.I. ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown wrote in an open letter to the Town Council in the lead-up to passing the Nike Resolution.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The R.I. ACLU has since commended Beauregard for reconsidering the decision. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “If rescinded, this will be a major victory for those who spoke out in favor of freedom of speech!” the R.I. ACLU tweeted. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recalling the resolution will allow the Town Council to move past the issue and reaffirm its community values, according to School Committee Member Paul Jones.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We believe in freedom of speech and we believe in being an all-inclusive community,” Jones told The Herald. “This resolution doesn’t define us and it never should have.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Neither Beauregard nor North Smithfield Superintendent of Schools Michael St. Jean could be reached for comment.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Raimondo proposes universal pre-K</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/19/raimondo-proposes-universal-pre-k/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gov. Gina Raimondo has announced that she will realize an initiative to fund universal state pre-kindergarten if she is elected for a second term. The announcement was made in a preschool classroom in Pawtucket’s Heritage Park YMCA Sept. 10, two days before Raimondo defeated Matt Brown and Spencer Dickinson in the primary.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Investing in pre-K is about improving K-12 education in Rhode Island. Pre-K is the most cost effective way to make significant improvements in K-12 outcomes,” wrote Communications Director of the Rhode Island Democratic Party Emily Samsel in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raimondo’s plan would add approximately 70 state pre-K classrooms per year over a five-year period, totaling about 6,000 additional seats for four-year-olds, according to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gina.raimondo/videos/269588430431210/">video of the announcement</a>. Expansion on this scale would mean nearly a 600 percent increase in the number of seats available. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As of September 2018, Rhode Island offers 1,080 state-sponsored pre-K spots, which are distributed across the 11 of Rhode Island’s 47 school districts with the highest rates of low-income students: Central Falls, Cranston, East Providence, Johnston, Newport, North Providence, Pawtucket, Providence, Warwick, West Warwick and Woonsocket. Among eligible students, there was a state pre-K waitlist of approximately 750 students this year, wrote Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Communications Director Meg Geoghegan in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raimondo estimated that, though expansion would cost $15 million per year, the initiative would “(save) a lot of money down the road,” she said in the announcement. In her email to The Herald, Samsel also cited a <a href="https://exceed.ri.gov/Docs/InvestingEarlyInSchoolSuccess.pdf">study</a> suggesting universal pre-K might save $126 million in pre-K through grade 12 education funding by 2030. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhode Island’s expanded state pre-K program would continue to follow a “blended model” that allows community centers and early childcare centers to compete with public schools for grants to fund pre-K classrooms, wherein grants for setting up pre-K classrooms are awarded to the programs that best demonstrate their ability to meet the state’s quality requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhode Island first created a state-funded pre-K program in 2009, which served 126 students, according to the Rhode Island Department of Education <a href="http://www.ride.ri.gov/InstructionAssessment/EarlyChildhoodEducation/StatePre-K.aspx">website</a>. In 2014, Rhode Island received a $19 million federal grant to expand state pre-K over the course of four years from 17 classrooms serving 306 children to 60 classrooms accomodating 1,080 students. “We knew that this would be the final year of scaleup” funded by the federal grant, Geoghegan said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whereas the existing state pre-K program received both federal and state funding, Raimondo’s proposed pre-K expansion would be solely funded by the state budget, Geoghegan wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Rhode Island pre-K program ranks among the best in the country. “There are three times more four-year-olds from low income communities participating in Rhode Island’s public pre-K program today than when the Governor first took office,” Samsel wrote. Rhode Island was ranked 19th for state spending and fourth for overall spending on pre-K education, according to the <a href="http://nieer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Rhode-Island_YB2017.pdf">State Preschool Yearbook 2017</a> published by the National Institute for Early Education Research. The report also shows that Rhode Island is one of only three states whose pre-K program meets every NIEER benchmark, earning it a 10/10 quality ranking.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Expanding the pre-K program “is a policy that makes a lot of sense from both an economic and a policy perspective,” said Elizabeth Burke Bryant, executive director of the educational non-profit Rhode Island KIDS COUNT.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While R.I. KIDS COUNT does not endorse candidates, the non-profit would strongly favor implementing Raimondo’s proposal. “Rhode Island KIDS COUNT has been a strong supporter of state pre-K for a number of years because we know what a difference it makes in leveling the playing field,” Burke Bryant said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In explaining the longstanding consistency of her commitment to early childhood education, Raimondo referenced her focus on expanding access to all-day kindergarten during her first term: “The first thing I did as governor is bring about all-day kindergarten, for every student in every public school in Rhode Island.” Prior to her initiative, “about 25 percent of kids in Rhode Island didn’t have access to all-day kindergarten,” she added. If the program were realized, Raimondo would expect approximately 70 percent of eligible students to take advantage of it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raimondo is “sure there will be resistance” to the proposal, especially from those who would consider it too expensive. Both Geoghegan and Burke Bryant suggested space might also pose a challenge to the initiative. It will be necessary to “ensure that there are adequate facilities available,” Burke Bryant said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raimondo’s opponents’ perspectives on universal pre-K vary.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cranston mayor and Republican gubernatorial candidate Allan Fung disagreed with the initiative and called it a “political Hail Mary,” according to the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180910/raimondo-vows-universal-pre-kindergarten-if-reelected">Providence Journal</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Independent gubernatorial candidate Joe Trillo expressed support for the idea of universal pre-K but took issue with Raimondo’s budgeting. “The Governor’s claim this will cost $15,000,000 annually is un-evidenced and comes at a time when government spending is already out of control,” he wrote in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Compassion Party gubernatorial candidate Anne Armstrong expressed concern with how “our public schools are failing older students in so many ways right now,” she wrote in an email to The Herald. Rather than expanding public pre-K, she would “give each family the ($12,000) per child this would cost and allow them to choose high-quality private pre-schools such as Montessori or Suzuki,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moderate Party gubernatorial candidate Bill Gilbert pointed out in an email to The Herald that universal pre-K had been part of his party’s platform since July. “An early start is essential. We are glad that (Raimondo) now agrees with us even if it is for political expedience.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gubernatorial candidates Allan Fung, Rebecca McLaughlin and Luis-Daniel Muñoz did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HOPE creates legislative guide for housing issues</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">As Rhode Island continues rebuilding </span><span class="s4">from the Great Recession of 2008, the key issues of homelessness and housing affordability remain a problem for many in the state, according to a study published by HousingWorks RI in 2017. In order to address and raise awareness around this issue at the legislative level, the University student group Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere created the Model Housing and Homelessness Policy Platform to share with elected officials and community homelessness activists. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">According to the HousingWorks RI study, some of the issues driving current housing instability include a lack of diverse, quality housing, an aging housing stock, high housing cost burdens and few affordable quality houses for low-income households. In 2016, “more than 4,200 Rhode Islanders spent at least one night in a shelter bed or transitional program” and 8,500 eviction cases were filed. In 2015, “half of all Rhode Island renter households, more than one in three homeowner households with a mortgage and one in five homeowner households without a mortgage (were) cost burdened,” meaning they spent over 30 percent of their annual income on housing, the study found.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In order to address these issues, HOPE’s policy platform lays out a series of short- and long-term priorities centered on supporting community members facing housing instability. In the short-term, the document recommends passing various pieces of legislation, from prohibiting landlords from discriminating against renters with government rental assistance to waiving fees for obtaining identification and records for those in danger of homelessness. In the long-term, the platform focuses on large-scale reforms to address the affordable housing dilemma. The recommendations, supported by a list of concrete steps to help achieve them, include increasing low-income housing development and creating greater housing stability. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Nathaniel Pettit ’20, a co-director of HOPE, the platform not only provides an actionable list for elected officials, but also functions as HOPE’s own set of priorities. “We’d be really happy to see this be used as a starting point for conversation … amongst the bigger housing advocacy community,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4">The document, which HOPE started writing in July, went through a series of discussions and revisions with homelessness advocacy groups throughout Rhode Island, Pettit said.</p>
<p class="p4">Because students are temporary residents of Rhode Island, it’s important for community advocacy groups to be involved in HOPE’s work, said Dhruv Singh ’20, communications director of HOPE. These groups include Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, Direct Action for Rights and Equality, Housing Network of Rhode Island, House of Hope CDC, HousingWorks RI and Signs of Providence.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Throughout the platform’s development, HousingWorks RI collaborated with the students of HOPE to help raise awareness around the policy issues and to shift toward solution-oriented conversations, said Brenda Clement, director of HousingWorks RI. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For Signs of Providence, collaborating with HOPE provided an opportunity to work with the students around policy initiatives to address eviction in the state, said Oscar Dupuy d’Angeac ’17, co-founder of Signs of Providence. “Rhode Island has three times the evictions … of Massachusetts,” he said. Currently, there are few protections for renters regarding sudden rent rises and abrupt housing changes that result in eviction, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4">After drafting the platform, HOPE presented the final platform to the housing and homelessness policy group at United Way, Pettit said. The next step of the process, sending out the final platform to elected officials, will take place in the next few days, he said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ultimately, Pettit hopes that this platform will help create a sustained advocacy effort around housing issues. “Many of us will be here for four years,” Pettit said. “We want to make sure that whoever takes over for us can continue a long-term vision. … That’s why it’s so important for us to embed our efforts amongst our community partners.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the 2018 Rhode Island gubernatorial race, Gov. Gina Raimondo has spearheaded college affordability with the proposed expansion of her key initiative, Rhode Island Promise. Her toughest opponent in the race, Republican Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, does not make a mention of the issue on his platform. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Island Promise currently provides two years of free tuition to students entering the Community College of Rhode Island who meet certain requirements. The plan requires students to be recent high school graduates, take full-time classes and maintain at least a 2.5 GPA. The governor’s original proposal from 2017 intended to guarantee two years of free college for in-state students attending the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College, as well as CCRI, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/06/gov-raimondo-proposes-two-years-free-tuition-state-colleges/">previously reported</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the full extent of this proposal was rejected by the legislature, in her re-election campaign Raimondo has reiterated her commitment to expanding the free tuition plan. Her full campaign promise includes making the last two years of school at RIC and URI free for recent high school graduates who sustain a good academic record and can graduate in four years. She has also promised to offer free tuition to all adults studying at CCRI, according to her <a href="https://ginaraimondo.com/updates/universal-education-job-training/">campaign website</a>. The proposal is estimated to cost around $35 million, according to the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180723/raimondo-promises-push-to-expand-free-tuition-to-uri-ric">Providence Journal</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On Sept. 18, Nick Mattiello, speaker of the House, questioned the program’s impact thus far and Raimondo’s plans for its expansion, according to <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/news/new-study-finds-free-college-programs-have-no-effect-on-whether-students-go">Go Local Prov</a>. The state is currently grappling with a $200 million deficit, he said, adding that the initiative could exacerbate its fiscal woes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While some may remain skeptical of her ability to expand Rhode Island Promise, “in terms of funding for the expansion of RI Promise to RIC and URI as well as adults at CCRI, the Governor will find room in the budget, just like she did for the current Rhode Island Promise program, and present a balanced budget to the legislature,” wrote Emily Samsel,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the communications director for the Rhode Island Democratic Party, in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The expansion of Rhode Island Promise has been met with support from the education community in Rhode Island. “We need to do more to make college accessible and affordable to all students, especially those who feel like it’s out of reach because of circumstances beyond their control,” wrote Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education in Rhode Island Ken Wagner in an email to The Herald. “By extending Promise to RIC and URI, … we could keep more students on track to graduate college and keep those students here in Rhode Island,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dean Libutti, vice provost for enrollment management at URI, also highlighted the motivation the program could provide to students. “It provides an incentive for students to work hard; it would certainly help more students stay on track” to graduate from college, he said, especially as “students and families (are) concerned about loan debt and that increasing cost of college.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">CCRI reported an increase of <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180723/raimondo-promises-push-to-expand-free-tuition-to-uri-ric">47 percent</a> in the number of full-time students enrolled just after graduating high school since the start of Rhode Island Promise. Supporters of Rhode Island Promise cite the increase in enrollment as a key sign of the program’s success. “We’ve seen already a positive enrollment increase at CCRI, and I think extending Promise would have a similar effect on RIC and URI,” Wagner said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The College Crusade of Rhode Island, a college readiness and scholarship program for students in low-income areas, has a similar take on the governor’s plan. President and CEO of The College Crusade Andrew Bramson said the program is beneficial not only because it has increased community college attendence but because it “communicates the fact that there is a college seat waiting for every student in Rhode Island that wants to work for it.” He added that “the impact of the program availability is just as important as the attendance.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Candidates in the gubernatorial race place different emphasis on the issue of college affordability. Mayor Fung makes no mention of the issue on his <a href="https://www.allanfung.com/we-can-do-better/">campaign website</a>, and did not respond to a request for comment on the issue by press time. Under his plans for Rhode Island’s future, he highlights veterans affairs, economic development and government reform.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The first gubernatorial debate in the race for the Rhode Island State House will take place tomorrow at the Bristol campus of Roger Williams University. Incumbent Democrat Gov. Gina Raimondo, Republican Mayor of Cranston Allan Fung and former Deputy Minority Leader Joseph Trillo, who is running as an independent, will take the stage at 7:00 p.m. Current polling from <a href="https://bit.ly/2Dxmh5h">WPRI</a> shows Raimondo seven points ahead of her closest challenger, Fung, with Trillo only receiving support from seven percent of the respondents. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Eyewitness News reporter Tim White and reporter Ted Nesi will moderate the debate which will be hosted by Danielle North, anchor for Eyewitness News This Morning, as reported by <a href="https://www.wpri.com/politics/wpri-12-to-host-first-ri-governor-debate-release-new-poll/1457805805">WPRI</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the questions in the debate have not been released to the public, there are various issues that could arise. The three candidates offer different perspectives on the future of Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of Raimondo’s major campaign goals is to grow the free tuition program Rhode Island Promise, as The Herald <a href="https://bit.ly/2OaalKW">previously reported</a>. The plan currently gives in-state students who meet certain requirements free tuition for two years at the Community College of Rhode Island. Raimondo hopes to extend the two years of free tuition to both the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College. Additionally, Raimondo has proposed universal pre-Kindergarten by creating about 70 new classrooms over the next five years, <a href="https://bit.ly/2OOPmdz">as reported by The Herald</a>. Estimates show that the Rhode Island Promise could cost approximately $35 million, according to the <a href="https://bit.ly/2v48zQE">Providence Journal</a>, and Raimondo has said the expanded pre-K program would cost approximately $15 million per year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung referred to Raimondo’s pre-K proposal as a “political Hail Mary,” according to the Providence Journal, while Trillo expressed concern over public spending while the state faces a budget deficit, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/19/raimondo-proposes-universal-pre-k/">previously reported</a>. The state currently faces a deficit of $158 million projected for the 2019 fiscal year, according to WPRI.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung plans to make Rhode Island “the land of startups and small businesses,” according to his <a href="https://bit.ly/2NGfdIj">campaign website</a>. To accomplish this goal, Fung proposes waiving first-year fees for start-ups and ensuring that licensing, permits and incorporation fees are the “lowest in New England.” Additionally, Fung’s platform suggests increasing school safety by putting a resource officer in every school. His campaign plans to reign in “overspending in other departments,” to fund this aim. Moreover, Fung plans to create an Office of the Inspector General to reduce waste, inspect for fraud and put term limits on state legislators.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Trillo’s<a href="https://bit.ly/2IgkpN0"> campaign website</a> lists a slew of policy positions, which include reducing taxes, reducing the size of the state government, increasing infrastructure spending and stopping the construction of the Burriville natural gas power plant. Trillo, like Fung, has also prioritized the need to make Rhode Island friendlier to small businesses.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rhode Island codifies DACA recipients’ right to obtain driver’s licenses</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/26/rhode-island-codifies-daca-recipients-right-obtain-drivers-licenses/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 21-year-old Rhode Islander Rodrigo Pimentel, driving is an essential part of life. Pimentel is the only member of his family with a driver’s license, so without one, “doing anything in life would be complicated,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Every job that I’ve had has required driving,” Pimentel said, adding that “Rhode Island is very car-dependent state. A car ride that takes 20 minutes could take an hour on the bus.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pimentel is a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows eligible undocumented immigrants to study and work lawfully in the United States. He has fought to maintain his driver’s license by advocating for the codification of license eligibility for DACA recipients. In June, the actions of Pimentel and local advocacy groups culminated in the Rhode Island General Assembly’s vote to pass a bill to protect DACA recipients’ current ability to obtain a license — even if the DACA program were to end. This legislation comes in the wake of threats from the Trump administration to end the DACA program altogether. Gov. Gina Raimondo signed the bill into law June 18. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The legislation, to be enacted Dec. 3, was sponsored by Rep. Shelby Maldonado (D-56) and Sen. Michael McCaffrey, D-Warwick. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By passing a law to protect DACA recipients’ right to procure licenses, “we have given these youth a level of certainty that ensures their valuable contributions to the Ocean State will continue for years to come — no matter what happens in Washington,” McCaffrey wrote in a statement to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pimentel attended and spoke at the bill’s signing in June. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s a common-sense issue,” he told The Herald,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>explaining that licensing drivers will allow people to purchase car insurance and receive more driving instruction, leading to safer roads. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to a Roger Williams University study, traffic fatalities and car insurance rates are lower in states where undocumented immigrants can obtain a driver’s license.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pimentel praised Raimondo for her role in the bill’s passage, saying that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“the governor showed real leadership here by doing this, as well as the General Assembly.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Raimondo did not respond to The Herald’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The bill will only effect the small portion of the undocumented community in Rhode Island who have or had DACA status. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s a nice gesture,” said Carl Krueger, a staff attorney at Dorcas International Institute of Rhode Island, who believes that the state still needs to push legislation that gives all undocumented people the opportunity to get a license. Currently, Rhode Island requires a social security number from driver’s license applicants. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Driving is not a “privilege, it’s a necessity for most people,” Krueger said, adding that anyone who can prove residency and pass a driver’s exam should be able to drive in the state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, 12 states and the District of Columbia allow undocumented people without DACA status to apply for driver’s licenses, including Vermont and Connecticut, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ultimately, Pimentel sees the recently passed legislation as an important “first step.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“One of the greatest things we have is storytelling,” Pimentel said. “Appealing to logic, appealing to emotion, and telling your story is a tool that you can use to orchestrate change. … You can actually change people’s minds by telling your story.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re looking for a good coat for the impending winter, you will no longer have to go further than Thayer Street. The doors of the mountain-style clothing company Denali are open for business following a Sept. 15 launch party. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We supply people with knowledge and products to go on different adventures no matter where they’re going,” said store manager Kevin Devine, “whether it’s around the corner from the house, or if they are traveling overseas to go hiking or backpacking.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University’s real estate subsidiary Farview, Inc. leased 271 Thayer to Denali, replacing City Sports, wrote Director of News and Editorial Development Brian Clark in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“As a key commercial district that intersects campus, what’s most important to Brown is that Thayer Street is an attractive, clean and safe retail corridor where members of the University community can visit and local merchants can thrive,” Clark wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 271 Thayer property lay vacant for around two years while the University’s Real Estate Office searched for a suitable tenant, said Vice President of Real Estate John Luipold. The University did not want to subdivide the building or bring in another restaurant, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We took a very thoughtful approach,” Luipold said. “We like (Denali’s) mission to help the environment, and we wanted a tenant that we thought would be a draw from beyond the immediate College Hill area.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Denali sales associate Melissa Monteiro-Lopes emphasized Denali’s relaxed and welcoming atmosphere as its defining feature. Denali’s live garden of ferns and other plants running up its two floors, along with trees serving as support columns, provides customers with a refreshing vibe. The apparel on display ranges from outdoor classics like Patagonia and The North Face to sturdy Merrell footwear and high-end Kühl fabrics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We throw everything together,” said Monteiro-Lopes, a Cranston native. “We have the rugged, the classy, then everyday wear for people who are leisurely but always on the go. These are pieces that are going to last for a very long time.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Thayer Street Denali store wants to find ways to connect with the surrounding community by hosting free clinics to teach outdoor skills like orienteering and day hiking safety, Devine said. Of Denali’s 14 employees, nine are from Rhode Island, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Denali also plans to work with local organizations like Save the Bay and the Brown Outing Club to help publicize environmental awareness and clean-up campaigns, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The Brown Outing Club for a long time has been trying to give back more for the community,” said Ethan Taswell, a member of the BOC. “We’re looking to expand beyond Brown, (and) we’re hoping to develop a partnership with companies on Thayer Street like Denali.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">In the first televised debate of the gubernatorial election, incumbent Democrat Gov. Gina Raimondo went head-to-head with Republican nominee Allan Fung and independent candidate Joe Trillo at Roger Williams University Sept. 27.</p>
<p class="p4">Target 12 reporter Tim White and Eyewitness News reporter Ted Nesi moderated the tense, hour-long debate that aired on WPRI, questioning candidates on issues such as gun control, proposed tax cuts and economic growth. The debate was hosted by Danielle North, anchor for Eyewitness News This Morning.</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo faced tough questions on Unified Health Infrastructure Project, her controversial computerized health care and benefits program, and the PawSox’s <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/04/pawsox-move-worcester-ma/">decision to move to Worcester, Massachusetts</a>. She touted her policies promoting small business investment and school safety through gun control reform, as well as her willingness to stand up against the policies of the Trump administration.</p>
<p class="p4">Cranston Mayor Fung refused to disavow the Trump administration explicitly, though he opposed its policy of separating immigrant families.</p>
<p class="p4">Fung criticized Raimondo for her failure to keep the PawSox in Pawtucket and difficulties in implementing UHIP. He repeatedly charged that she was an “insider” influenced by corporate donations. When asked about his own track record, Fung acknowledged responsibility for his role in a case of corruption in the Cranston police department in 2015. Fung told the audience that, if elected, he would focus on “common sense” polices such as implementing stronger work requirements for able-bodied adults on welfare.</p>
<p class="p4">Trillo, a former R.I. State House deputy minority leader and ardent Trump supporter, highlighted his self-funded campaign and ability to fight — without partisan allegiances — on behalf of taxpayers against lobbyists. He attacked the proposed Burrillville natural gas power plant and promised that public tax dollars would be spent more efficiently under his administration. Trillo, who is trailing considerably in the polls, took fire from the moderators for not actively opposing Raimondo’s UHIP initiative in the past.</p>
<p class="p4">“What I hope happened tonight is that voters got a chance to see where candidates stand,” White told The Herald. “That’s the purpose of these debates — to try and cut through the noise and get to the signal of what people are saying.” Raimondo and Fung refused to participate in pre-primary debates in order to “coast through the primary,” which was a “disservice to voters,” White added.</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo led Fung 43-36 percent<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>points with a 4.8 percent margin of error in a WPRI/RWU poll conducted earlier this month. In the same poll, Trillo came in at 7 percent. There are three more independent candidates in the gubernatorial race — Bill Gilbert, Luis-Daniel Muñoz and Anne Armstrong, none of whom were invited to participate in the debate.</p>
<p class="p4">Here’s where Raimondo, Fung and Trillo stood on some key issues:</p>
<p class="p6"><b> The economy</b></p>
<p class="p4">“When I began, Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate in the country,” Raimondo said. “Today, we are at the lowest unemployment rate we’ve had in 20 years, … and last year, Rhode Island had the highest wage growth in the country.”</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo asserted that her economic policy — built on investments in small business and infrastructure through programs like Rebuild RI — has created thousands of jobs.</p>
<p class="p4">White pressed Fung on whether his tax plan would require cuts from social services and education sectors. In response, Fung promised to root out fraud in state government and reshape Rhode Island commerce by ending the “culture of corporate welfare” that he accused Raimondo of nurturing.</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo stated that her economic policies have not been influenced by campaign donations.</p>
<p class="p4">Trillo proposed reducing taxes for Rhode Islanders. To balance the books, Trillo said he would “go through every state department with a scalpel” to reduce inefficiencies. His experience in construction would help him avoid wasting tax dollars on development, he said.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>PawSox</b></p>
<p class="p4">Both Fung and Trillo criticized Raimondo and the State House for not doing more to keep the PawSox in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s a failure of leadership on all parts,” Fung said. “They all should have been at the table. That’s what I would have done.”</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo said she lamented the loss of the team as much as anyone and that she had done all she could do in putting together a deal the team said they would accept. Instead, she blamed the legislature for taking “a year and a half” to act on her proposed deal as the PawSox found a more attractive offer.</p>
<p class="p4">“I won’t rest until McCoy (Stadium) is full,” she said, referring to the PawSox’s old stadium in Pawtucket.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Renewables and climate action</b></p>
<p class="p4">To varying degrees, all candidates consider protecting the environment a priority, pointing to renewable energy as a potential way to meet the challenges of climate change.</p>
<p class="p4">“We need to move as fast as we can toward 100 percent renewables,” Raimondo said. Under her term, Raimondo added that she oversaw the creation of an offshore wind farm.</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo has previously endorsed the polarizing $1 billion Burrillville natural gas power plant, which is in the midst of a legal dispute with the Conservation Law Foundation.</p>
<p class="p4">Fung also said he supported renewable energy but that it “can’t be forced down people’s throats.” He highlighted Cranston’s solar project developments as evidence of his successful environmental policies. Fung is against the Burrillville plant, as he "support(s) local control" and claims that the town’s residents oppose the plan.</p>
<p class="p4">Trillo hesitated in his support of renewable energy, endorsing it with some qualifications. “I would only support it if the rate to the tax payers is going to be very competitive with what it is right now for fossil fuel,” he said. “If the rate is higher and the impact on our fishing industry is too great, then I can’t support it.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>School safety and gun control</b></p>
<p class="p4">All candidates agreed on the need to create safe school environments for children in light of recent national and local school shootings, but they differed on which policies would create safer schools.</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo is vocal in her support of gun control and has pushed for bans on military-style weapons and high capacity magazines. However, she defended her position against putting metal detectors in schools. “Schools shouldn’t look like prisons,” Raimondo said.</p>
<p class="p4">Fung championed a plan to put additional security guards and retired police officers on school campuses to increase safety. “Unlike the governor, I don’t believe in having a piece of paper saying no guns in school — that’s not going to stop criminal acts,” Fung said, referring to Raimondo’s “red flag” executive order enacted earlier this year to remove guns from individuals deemed a threat to public safety.</p>
<p class="p4">Trillo pushed for teachers to receive special concealed carry permits to prevent school shootings and stressed that guns are not the only way to cause violence in a school, listing bombs and knives as potential dangers.</p>
<p class="p4">“There’s a fallacy out there that guns are the problems,” Trillo said. “If there is a shooter in a school and I’m a teacher and I have a gun and I know how to use it, I’ll take the person out.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Health care</b></p>
<p class="p4">The moderators pressed Raimondo on UHIP,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a computer system intended to integrate social services and health care for hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders. UHIP has been plagued by technical issues and has cost the state approximately half a billion dollars.</p>
<p class="p4">“UHIP has had its share of struggles, but we have turned the corner,” Raimondo said. “Having said that, mistakes were made, which I own.”</p>
<p class="p4">The other two candidates remained firmly against UHIP.</p>
<p class="p4">“I’m not sure if UHIP is ever going to be fixed,” Fung said. “On day one, I will pull the plug.”</p>
<p class="p4">Trillo said that he fought against UHIP and has tried to protect taxpayer dollars from being wasted.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Kavanaugh Confirmation</b></p>
<p class="p4">Every candidate agreed that the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh should be paused following the testimony yesterday by Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. All candidates stated they believe the claims warrant an independent investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 2018 Rhode Island gubernatorial race, four third-party candidates are challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. Gina Raimondo and her Republican opponent Cranston Mayor Allan Fung.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A r<a href="https://www.wpri.com/politics/wpri-12rwu-poll-raimondo-re-election-lead-grows-whitehouse-far-ahead/1462303524" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecent survey by WPRI/RWU</a> found that 20 percent of R.I. voters are either backing an independent candidate or undecided. Independents have run successful campaigns in the past 30 to 40 years, said Richard Arenberg, visiting professor of the practice of political science, citing <a href="https://www.ri.gov/election/results/2010/general_election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lincoln Chafee’s win</a> in the 2010 R.I. gubernatorial race.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Third-party candidates can be very influential in the outcome of an election,” Arenberg said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even in cases when independent runs are not successful, the votes garnered by these candidates can have a direct effect on who is elected, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moderate Party candidate Bill Gilbert claims that his party’s 2014 bid —<a href="https://www.ri.gov/election/results/2014/general_election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> which received 21.4 percent of all votes</a> — propelled Raimondo into office. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Moderate Party — which aims to retain 5 percent of voters in the R.I. election — leans conservative in its emphasis on small government but has a libertarian approach to social issues. The Moderates leave these issues up to individual candidates rather than having a particular party standard, Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unlike the Republican party, for example, Gilbert believes in the need for a “safety net” that provides government assistance to those most vulnerable in society.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The party was officially recognized in 2009 and is the only political party on voting ballots in Rhode Island besides the Democratic and Republican parties.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m trying to affect politics and win,” Gilbert said. “But I’ll settle for affecting the political game by trying to present credible, honest and issue-driven dialogue.” He added that third-party candidates can raise issues that are not being discussed by the nominees of major parties.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, gaining such exposure can itself be a challenge. Independent candidate Luis-Daniel Muñoz — who is advocating for lower taxes, trade school programs and education and health care reform — believes several R.I. media organizations purposely excluded him from news coverage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For example, Muñoz said WPRI’s criteria for choosing candidates to cover and participate in debates has been inconsistent. While WPRI continues to report on Gilbert and independent candidate Joe Trillo, who previously served as a state representative, he was not “given the same opportunity,” Muñoz added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Muñoz’s campaign held a silent protest in Bristol last night — right outside of the WPRI and Roger Williams University debate that only Raimondo, Fung and Trillo participated in.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The media, in making decisions about who they are going to let into debates, … can have a great deal of influence” on an election, Arenberg said. “If the third-party candidate is excluded from a debate, for example, it makes it all that much harder to be taken seriously.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Independent candidate Anne Armstrong of the Compassion Party believes that the state should implement ranked-choice voting, which was most recently implemented for state-level elections in Maine. Armstrong also advocates for a plan called reGenerative Funding, which aims to fund social services, and is a proponent of the health and economic benefits of cannabis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trillo could not be reached for comment. Trillo is focused on eliminating what he considers wasteful public spending. In Thursday night’s gubernatorial debate, he said he wants to reduce taxes and “shed the image of (Rhode Island as) a sanctuary state.” He insisted that he was “in this race to win it.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rhode Island unemployment at 20-year low</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/30/rhode-island-unemployment-20-year-low/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Rhode Island unemployment rate is down to 4 percent for the month of August and closely trails the national August rate of 3.9 percent, according to a recent <a href="http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/annavg.htm">report</a> released by the R.I. Department of Labor and Training. There are 8,900 more employed residents than there were exactly a year ago.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s been significant progress recently to come down and be right on level with the national unemployment rate,” said Nora Crowley, chief public affairs officer for the R.I. Department of Labor and Training. She added that the R.I. unemployment rate is currently the lowest it has been in 20 years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Great Recession in the late 2000s left Rhode Island with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. The state had the nation’s highest unemployment rate of 9.3 percent in 2013, but it has since improved to 30th, according to the R.I. Department of Labor and Training. This trend should continue to improve in the coming months, Crowley said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The department pays particular attention to middle-waged industries — which are in sectors such as manufacturing and construction — because these fields provide opportunities for middle-class families. Through efforts such as the business-led partnership program Real Jobs Rhode Island, which connects employers to potential employees and provides training programs, the state has invested in these sectors because they have been slow to recover from the recession, Crowley said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the past year, the state <a href="http://www.dlt.ri.gov/News_Releases/NR092018.htm">added</a> 1,800 jobs in the Professional and Business sector, 400 in the Financial Services sector and 1,500 in Health Care and Social Assistance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Real Jobs Rhode Island plans to go further in developing “robust industries” such as technology and hopes to double its training efforts in those fields. The program surpassed its projected annual target of placing 3,500 trained employees by 200 as of Sept. 1, Crowley said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“A thriving economy in Providence and in Rhode Island is certainly good for the greater community and the state’s residents,” wrote Director of News and Editorial Development Brian Clark in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But CEO of Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity Mike Stenhouse believes that a downward trend in unemployment in the state still does not provide a full picture of Rhode Island’s economic climate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“A lot of people check in the box that they worked a few hours,” Stenhouse said. “But if you really look at whether or not they’re prosperous, the answer is no.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the state does offer lower-paying jobs, its high-tax and regulatory policies continue to drive away business owners and further investments in high-end industries, Stenhouse said. “Compared to the money people are making and … the taxes they are paying, it is not a good environment for a business to be established and grow.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For Brown students, these job prospects may push them toward moving elsewhere after graduation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In his job search, Kevin Argueta ’17.5 found that Rhode Island’s highest paying jobs are predominately in software and not in engineering, his intended field. The engineering firms he encountered were focused on expanding outside of the state. Argueta, a R.I. native, relocated to Virginia to pursue a job offering in electrical engineering.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Senior Ryan Miller ’19, a double concentrator in architectural studies and urban studies, is also looking beyond Rhode Island for employment.“While I know of some very interesting smaller architectural firms in Providence, I don’t have the impression that it’s a huge field in Rhode Island,” Miller said. “I think that the specialties that I’m interested in related to design are more likely to be active in larger cities than Providence.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">As the Nov. 6 election approaches, the Swearer Center for Public Service is working with the Brown College Democrats, the Brown University Republicans and the Brown Progressive Action Committee to mobilize student voting in an attempt to improve the 13 percent student voter turnout of the 2014 midterms.</span></p>
<p class="p4">The Swearer Center’s voter registration drives now use TurboVote, an online service that helps citizens register to vote and sends absentee ballots to their mailboxes. Over 400 students have signed up for TurboVote since Aug. 1, said Director of Student Development at the Swearer Center Betsy Shimberg.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Swearer Center will also sponsor a workshop Oct. 9 with R.I. Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, Shimberg said, adding that Gorbea will bring voting machines with mock ballots with her “so students can actually practice filling in the bubbles and putting (the ballots) in the machines,” which “kind of demystifies ‘What is this voting thing?’” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shimberg also plans to invite elected officials running for office in uncontested races to speak and meet with small groups of students. Her goal, she said, is to get at least 26 percent of students to vote in this midterm election, which would double the 13 percent of students who voted in the 2014 elections.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University ranks among Washington Monthly’s <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/september-october-2018/americas-best-colleges-for-student-voting/">“America’s Best Colleges for Student Voting,”</a> a list published in Sept. 2018 of 58 schools that includes Tufts, Northwestern and Harvard. Every school featured on the list satisfied four criteria: participation in Tufts University’s National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement; enrollment in the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge; release of <a href="https://www.allinchallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/Brown-University-NSLVE-2016.pdf">NSLVE data</a> and publication of an <a href="https://www.allinchallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/Brown-University-Action-Plan-2018.pdf">ALL IN action plan</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Swearer Center published a draft of its ALL IN Challenge action plan in May, which focuses on registering and mobilizing voters for the midterm elections, integrating voting and civic engagement into student life and educating the Brown community on “liberal democracy and civic engagement.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Based on the NSLVE data for 2014 and 2016, the Swearer Center decided to devote special attention to graduate students and all students in STEM disciplines, “though our 2014 midterm participation was so poor that any generalized turnout efforts will help improve,” according to the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In 2016, 52 percent of Brown undergraduates voted, while only 39.3 percent of Brown graduate students voted. That same year, 33.2 percent of students studying business voted and 40 percent of students studying engineering voted. Those studying environmental sciences and English literature ranked among the highest, with 65.2 percent and 60.1 percent voting participation, respectively, according to the University’s published NSVLE data set.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“People are registered to vote; that’s not it. It’s that they have to care and feel connected in order to vote,” Shimberg said. “How do we educate people so they feel confident in how they’re voting? That’s really on you as a citizen. That’s your privilege.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brianna McFadden ’20, secretary of No Labels at the University, said that students “want to be truly informed” before voting, adding that she has noticed “a slight sense of … apathy. … To me what’s important is civic engagement and making sure people are involved in the political process and feel like they have a space to be involved in the political process.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Julia Kirschenbaum ’19, chair of BPAC, emphasized the importance of viable candidates who connect with young voters in bolstering civic engagement. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It can be hard to get out and vote when you feel like you don’t identify with the platforms of any of the candidates represented on the ballot. So I think that goes back to ensuring people are running for office who represent us,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kirschenbaum also urged out-of-state students who register to vote in Rhode Island to remember that they are likely “transient members of this community,” adding that “we have to listen to the people who actually live here and have been affected by the policies here for years and years and years.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shimberg stressed that students, whether they can vote in Rhode Island or not, can create change in the Providence community. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Voting is one small part of civic engagement,” Shimberg said, adding that the Swearer Center developed a Beyond the Ballot campaign with Generation Citizen to encourage students to stay involved by calling policymakers, attending political board meetings and engaging in conversations with people with whom they might disagree, among other initiatives.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Panel talks role of media in Trump era</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Discussion of America’s rapidly changing media landscape alternated between heated arguments and unanimous agreement among panelists at the Joukowsky Forum in the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs yesterday. The talk, entitled “An Inside Look at Election Coverage,” featured debate on topics ranging from President Trump’s contentious relationship with the press to the media’s coverage of sexual allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.</p>
<p class="p4">While the panelists — David Corn ’81, Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones and on-air analyst for MSNBC; Karen Finney, a political commentator and former senior advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2016; Mary Katharine Ham, CNN contributor and senior writer at The Federalist; and Rich Lowry, Fox News commentator and editor of The National Review — represented positions across the political spectrum, all four agreed that Trump’s dishonesty is unlike anything the country has seen from a president before. “It’s pretty remarkable that one fact we can all agree on is that he lies,” Finney said.</p>
<p class="p4">“All White Houses have conflict and tension with the media,” Corn added. “Trump does something different than anyone else. That is not just that he has a war on the media — he has a war on truth.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Washington Post counted 5,001 false statements made by Trump in the first 18 months of his presidency, Corn said. While previous presidents sometimes made misstatements, “no one comes close to this record,” he said. “It’s hard for the media to cover somebody who says so many things that are untrue.”</p>
<p class="p4">Ham agreed that the media is easily distracted by Trump’s actions. “We end up covering whatever it is that he was tweeting instead of talking about policy,” she added. “He has a sort of savant-like ability to get to the press and turn the press into a tool of his in this giant drama that he is creating every day.”</p>
<p class="p4">Though Lowry said the press is “openly hostile” to Trump’s presidency, he argued that media outlets benefit from their coverage of Trump. “This is a deeply symbiotic relationship” between Trump and the media, he said. “The press, at the same time it’s outraged by everything he does and says, covers him obsessively and enjoys all the new subscriptions and all the audience ratings that come from this reality show we’re living in.”</p>
<p class="p4">Trump has also altered the media’s traditional role as an intermediary between the people and the government, Finney said. “The media and reporters are a channel to get information out,” she said. “In this day and age, we have multiple channels — including Twitter and social media — where you can have a direct line to the president.”</p>
<p class="p4">This flow of information — which allows people to engage in immediate and public debate on any topic — is a new feature of the media landscape, Corn said. “It used to just be information in one direction: us to you,” he explained. “Now there is a different dynamic that goes on. It can be painful at times, but ultimately it breaks down the barrier” between citizens, the media and the government.</p>
<p class="p4">Lowry sees the increase in different news sources as a positive development. “It used to be that there were three networks where you got your news,” he explained. “They were referred to — somewhat ironically, but seriously — as ‘the voice of God.’ For me, that is not a good media environment. What we have now has downsides, but it’s better.”</p>
<p class="p4">The internet also makes primary sources much more publicly accessible than ever before, Ham added. “You can go search out the full video of someone saying something. You can go search out the full transcript,” she said. “That is something we did not have at our disposal not very long ago.”</p>
<p class="p4">Because of this access to primary sources, media coverage is less important today, Corn said. Twenty percent of households tuned in to last Thursday’s Senate hearing involving Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, and many more people likely watched the hearing online, he noted. “We can nitpick about things that people have gotten wrong or false narratives, but basically everybody got to see the two primary actors make their best cases and judge for themselves,” he said. “This is all happening so much in the glare of public attention that I think it’s hard for the media to (mess) it up.”</p>
<p class="p4">“But they have,” Lowry and Ham both replied. The panelists launched into a lengthy debate on the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh that drew some aggravated responses from audience members. Lowry and Ham argued that the media has been unfair in its coverage of Kavanaugh, while Corn and Finney countered that Kavanaugh’s recent and past behavior has broken traditional standards of judicial temperament.</p>
<p class="p4">One audience member, Alan Flink ’49, entered the panelists’ debate on Kavanaugh. “This is not a court of law,” he said. “This is not a question of who’s right or who’s wrong. The question should be whether Brett Kavanaugh is an appropriate person to sit on the highest court in the United States.” Flink went on to argue that Kavanaugh’s highly partisan and belligerent behavior in the hearing disqualifies him from the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="p4">Flink told The Herald he was unsurprised that the panel argued extensively over Kavanaugh. But he was surprised that all four panelists “agreed that the president is a consummate liar.”</p>
<p class="p4">“Lying can’t be acceptable and shouldn’t be acceptable,” Flink said. “It’s damaging, and it should be subject to the strongest condemnation. It’s unworthy of the United States of America.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Students stay in Providence over summer through University programs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Swearer Center for Public Service is partnering with over 100 local nonprofits that are looking to attract student interns over the summer — increasing the number of partner organizations affiliated with the Swearer Center fivefold over the past couple of years, said Director of Student Development at the Swearer Center Betsy Shimberg. The Swearer Center also assists students hoping to intern in Providence over the summer through the iProv Summer Fellowship Program, a program in conjunction with Careers and Life After Brown that awards 20 undergraduate students $3,500 stipends to pursue full-time summer internships with nonprofit organizations based in the greater Providence area.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Swearer does a lot of work to generate these employer partnerships and then we sort of run an application process where students will apply to iProv,” said Director of CareerLAB Matthew Donato. “These are very popular internships.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to programs run through the Swearer Center, students who choose to stay in Providence can fund their summer through the BrownConnect LINK Award Program, which grants selected students $3,500 for domestic internships. Last year, 20 percent of LINK award recipients chose to intern in Providence,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Donato said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Computer science students intent on spending the summer in Providence can also turn to Bears@Work, a program that connects computer science students to R.I. tech companies through a variety of internship opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since the University has historically matched motivated students to local companies, demand for interns has burgeoned and companies work to entice<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“talent to stay in the state long term,” Donato said. For students, Donato attributed the popularity of interning in Providence to access to campus facilities and the affordability of the city, among other explanations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students who stayed in Providence this summer enjoyed some of these perks, referencing positive experiences using their free access to Rhode Island Public Transit Authority to explore Newport Beach and Cranston, taking advantage of gym and library access and finding local spots like<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Coffee Exchange, AS220, Xaco Taco, White Electric and a wealth of farmers markets that appear during the summer months.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shell Yang ’19 developed software for Utilidata in downtown Providence through Bears@Work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yang said she developed a stronger connection to Providence through her experience living near campus. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Elana Hausknecht ’21 interned at Southside Community Land Trust over the summer with funding from iProv. She said that spending time in Providence after her first year helped her realize that as a student at the University, she has a responsibility to the greater Providence community. Hausknecht now is a head of Winter Break Providence, which allows students to spend the winter in the city. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alexander Philips ’21, who received iProv funding to intern at the R.I. Department of State Elections, said his summer experience helped him figure out his career goals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“As my first job in the public sector, I gained valuable experience working with the public on important civic issues,” he wrote in a reflection piece for the Swearer Center. “The internship made me consider pursuing a career serving the public in a governmental position.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Director of the State Government Internship Program Bea Lanzi said she hopes to increase her on-campus presence, attracting students to work at the Statehouse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rose Lang-Maso ’20, who worked on Aaron Regunberg’s ’12 lieutenant governor campaign<span class="Apple-converted-space"> with a LINK award</span>, urged students to engage in life outside of College Hill. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We have a lot of institutional privilege here at Brown and a lot of resources, and I think we should be using those to sort of advocate for the folks in Providence in the ways they want to be advocated for, and the first step of that is to get off the Hill,” she said, adding that spending time at local establishments over the summer, in particular the coffee shop White Electric, allowed her to build a relationship with people outside of the University’s community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lang-Maso continued to work on Regunberg’s campaign into the academic year — an experience that highlighted the disconnect between her life at the University and the events happening in its surrounding areas, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last month, Lang-Maso left her office approximately three hours before a shooting nearby outside of the Providence Career and Technical Academy. “That’s when I really had this strong moment of okay, Brown’s really separated from things … that was a really stark example of that for me. Things happen beyond here that matter.”</span></p>
<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that <span class="s1">Rose Lang-Maso ’20 worked on Aaron Regunberg’s ’12 lieutenant governor campaign<span class="Apple-converted-space"> through iProv. In fact, she did so with a LINK award. The article also stated that Lang-Maso left her office approximately an hour and a half before a shooting nearby outside of the Providence Career and Technical Academy. In fact, she left her office around three hours before the shooting. The Herald regrets the errors. </span></span></strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Resources available for off-campus housing</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/04/resources-available-off-campus-housing/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deciding to live off-campus — whether through University-owned auxiliary housing or renting property from a third-party landlord — can seem daunting. There are leases to sign, off-campus lotteries to enter and kitchen appliances to buy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first wave of applications for off-campus housing opened Sept. 25. For students trying to navigate the process of moving off-campus, there are tips and resources that can help to ease the transition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Office of Residential Life’s website has a “quite robust” volume of information to make sure students are well-versed in their rights and responsibilities, according to Richard Hilton, associate director for operations of ResLife. Students who intend to move off-campus are required to review a set of slides on housing codes, Hilton said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Auxiliary Housing Office also has information on its website, including a “<a href="https://www.brown.edu/offices/real-estate/auxiliary-housing/campus-housing-service/guide-living-campus">Guide to Living Off-Campus</a>,” which includes information on the responsibilities and rights of both tenants and landlords as well as fire and street safety. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the past, ResLife and the Auxiliary Housing Office have held information sessions before the off-campus lottery started, but Hilton said they were often “poorly attended,” so the University decided to allocate resources elsewhere. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Auxiliary Housing Office website also hosts private listings. The properties listed must comply with codes and city standards or risk being taken off the list, according to Tracy Mansour, director of auxiliary housing. For a 60-day-long advertisement, Auxiliary Housing charges $125.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have had situations where we’ve considered taking listings down,” Mansour said, referencing cases where the listing is a scam or when property is advertised by someone other than its owner. The office does issue a disclaimer that both landlords and potential renters are the responsible parties in the transaction and that the University can’t be held liable for any claims.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I have seen students that have been taken advantage of when looking for off-campus housing,” wrote Campus Police Officer Kelly Mitchell, adding that students should work through reputable companies and owners and never pay money without actually seeing the housing. “I understand it is probably your first off-campus or away-from-home apartment. Don’t settle,” Mitchell wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If students choose to rent auxiliary housing from the University, they have the option of paying rent through Banner. The Department of Facilities Management is also responsible for the maintenance of auxiliary housing, Mansour said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Providence housing stock in the city is older than housing stock in other parts of the country, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/25/rhode-island-struggles-address-lead-poisoning-problem/">previously reported</a>. Older housing stock can mean the presence of fewer renovations and more lead.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Providence Water, the source of on-and off-campus water, has tested high lead levels in 2016 and 2017, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/25/rhode-island-struggles-address-lead-poisoning-problem/">previously reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Stephen Morin, director of the Office of Environmental Health and Safety, the University is testing water in its buildings this year. After testing for lead in 2007 and 2008, the University “provided signs indicating the issue and Facilities Management provided five-gallon bottles of water for building occupants” in buildings that tested above the EPA action levels for lead, Morin wrote in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For auxiliary housing that tested positive for high levels of lead, tenants were informed of the risk and water filters were provided to students. “The bottled water and water filters continue to be provided in these buildings,” Morin wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Office of Environmental Health and Safety also provides fire safety evaluations for Residential Security Vulnerability Assessments, which are available to students living off-campus in private housing on request. Assessments check for safe smoke and CO2 detectors as well as fire escape, electrical and heating safety. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To request a vulnerability assessment, students need to fill out a short questionnaire on the Brown Department of Public Safety’s website. A DPS officer will then contact the student for scheduling.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The vulnerability assessment program began in July 2016 and aims to enhance housing security by assessing entrance points, locks, lighting and surrounding neighborhood features such as street signs, paving and fencing, according to Mitchell. The “walk-through” assesses risks and makes recommendations, but it is up to students to act on suggestions, Mitchell wrote in email to The Herald. Common mistakes Mitchell sees students make include not locking common doors, first floor windows and basement access. </span></p>

		<title>Whitehouse talks Kavanaugh, partisanship, sexual assault claims</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, has represented the state in the U. S. Senate since 2007 and currently sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Before being elected to the Senate, Whitehouse was the Rhode Island Attorney General from 1998 to 2003. On Friday, he sat down with The Herald to discuss the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, Christine Blasey Ford’s statement as well as today’s final confirmation vote.</span>

<b>Herald: If there’s anything you could say about the investigation and how thorough it was, what would you say?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitehouse: I would say that I found it incomplete, and that if the FBI had sent me a package like that when I was (a) United States Attorney, I would have sent it back for further investigation.</span>

<b>The New York Times reported that about nine pages of the report were about Mark Judge. Do you feel he made a significant impact in his statements?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are in a strange situation on the witness summaries that we were provided by the FBI because there are quite strict rules about not discussing publicly any of the content. … (It’s) a little bit frustrating because the Republicans are saying things about the contents of the witness summaries in what seems to me to be a violation of those rules. And I’m not sure what I’m permitted to do in (the) wake of their having broken the rules, but my inclination is to stay within the rules. So, that very much limits what I can say about the contents of the witness summaries. One technical thing: What we were provided with was a series of witness summaries of interviews. There was not something that would be properly considered a report.</span>

<b>Do you think the investigation will ever be made public or will be made public soon considering there is a vote today?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I doubt that it will be made public. I guess I’ll just stop there.</span>

<b>Would there ever be a push to try to make it public from the Democrats?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the opening push should be for a complete, thorough investigation. That’s the key step. Making public witness summaries — or sections of witness summaries — that came out of a process that appears to me more designed to step around the truth than find the truth is not as helpful as actually getting a sincere and thorough investigation completed.</span>

<b>How will you vote today?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was an early ‘no,’ right after the first Judiciary Committee hearing, when I had a chance to see Kavanaugh in action before the committee. </span>

<b>What factors led you to that ‘no’? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest factor for me is the array of indicators that he would be a highly partisan Supreme Court judge and contribute to what is a very distressing trend at the Supreme Court of five-to-four partisan Supreme Court decisions that yield big victories for big Republican interests.</span>

<b>Following the second portion of the hearings, after Blasey Ford’s accusation came out to the public, what do you think … Kavanaugh’s (statements) revealed about his character and also his temperament?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To me, it confirmed concerns that I had about his temperament and his truthfulness and his partisanship. I thought the most telling part of his statement was when he called up the Clintons as participants in some kind of a conspiracy against him. To me, that seemed like (a) very far out conspiracy theory. And the fact that he was willing to go there was, to me, a very disturbing signal. It’s one thing to be angry, it’s another thing to have your anger take you into the land of conspiracy theory and false blame. False blame is a particularly dangerous thing from somebody who wants to be a judge. </span>

<b>What did you make of the Republicans choosing to have a prosecutor question Blasey Ford?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think they were concerned about the appearance of the all elderly white male makeup of the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee. This was a vehicle for getting a female face into the equation.</span>

<b>Republicans had originally said they would yield all their time to a prosecutor, and then (starting) with Lindsey Graham, … comments from came from Republican Senators themselves. What do you make about some of the anger that came from those Republican Senators?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think at some point in the day there came a realization that their strategy to hide behind a prosecutor was a complete failure and that Blasey Ford was, as President Trump himself said, a credible and compelling witness. They basically needed to change the narrative as urgently as possible. </span>

<b>What do you say to the Republican argument that Blasey Ford’s accusation and other accusations that have come out are really just an excuse to extend the confirmation process?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an argument that doesn’t align with the facts. Particularly the facts about Ford having made so many prior, consistent statements corroborating her accusation of Kavanaugh and (having) begun to try to get information about the assault to the Judiciary Committee before Kavanaugh was even the nominee.  </span>

<b>Going back to last Friday, when there was the decision to start an investigation, can you describe some of the confusion or the atmosphere when Sen. Flake had what some are calling a ‘crisis of conscience’ that day?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think there was indeed a crisis of conscience on the Republican side. I think Sen. Flake was the most visible and significant figure in all of this. But I do think our persistent and forceful arguments about the failure to reopen the background investigation for these new allegations were having an effect on other Republicans on the committee and on other Republicans watching from their offices.</span>

<b>Were there any personal experiences that you’ve had that affected your decision to vote against Kavanaugh or affected your reaction to Blasey Ford’s accusation?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most personal reaction that I have had in this episode since Blasey Ford came forward was to the incredible outpouring of support from Rhode Islanders and particularly from a group of women who each separately wrote me from a wide variety of backgrounds, from college students to grandmothers, who tell me about sexual assaults they had experienced.</span>

<b>Do you think these hearings will affect the midterm elections? Is there anything you have to say to Brown students or students in general about the democratic process following these hearings? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there’s a very simple reason that the Republicans were able to get away with all the many violations of Senate rules, Senate norms and simple decency in the rush to confirm this nominee and that is that there is no countervailing power in Washington against the monopoly on power that Republicans hold in the House, the Senate and the White House. And however strong your feelings are about what has happened in this process, I would hope the response is to get more engaged rather than to disengage, because the basic condition that allowed this to happen was a one-party monopoly on power and zero accountability as a result. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can I say one other thing? … I’m stuck again by these women who wrote about their own experiences. Often in the letters they said they told no one, or they said they only told their husbands, or they only told a small circle of friends. And they were sharing this private experience — something often held by them for decades — because they’ve wanted me to believe Ford because her memory and her reaction were exactly consistent with their memories and their reactions to their sexual assaults. I think that many people coming forward — which has never happened to me before, (which I’ve) never seen before and which a lot of my other colleagues in other states are seeing as well — gives us the opportunity to really make this a moment so that, as one woman said to me, her daughter and her granddaughters don’t have to grow up in a world in which these sexual assaults have be held private and kept secret because of the culture around them. We can move on in that, that’s the one really decent and even potentially beautiful thing about this wretched episode.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In anticipation of his lecture in Salomon Auditorium Wednesday, former secretary of state and long-time senator John Kerry P’97 spoke with The Herald about recent events in foreign policy, the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and his upcoming speech at the University.</span>

<b>Herald: You played an instrumental role in the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal) and recently urged Foreign Minister of Iran Javad Zarif to stick to the deal. You’ve been highly critical of President Trump’s decision to pull out of the agreement. Is there a viable future for the United States to rejoin the deal, or have we lost credibility to stick to an agreement?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kerry: I think the challenge here is President Trump’s credibility, not the United States’. I don’t think that we should just think about a simple rejoining. I think the situation is now such that it may require some kind of a follow-up agreement. We could rejoin the current agreement but we would have to work out some additional issues.</span>

<b>Any indication on what some of those issues might be?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it’s not going to happen in the near term because I believe it’s going to be very, very difficult for the Iranians to come back to the table under the current circumstances.</span>

<b>President Trump has done a lot to undermine much of the work you did as Secretary of State: the JCPOA, the Paris Accords and more generally, the demeanor and tone of the United States to the outside world. Do you see U.S. foreign policy continuing down Trump’s belligerent path or reversing the trend over the next couple of years?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It depends a lot on what the next couple of years bring us. If it’s certainly Donald Trump’s current policy with unilateralism, his willingness to pick a fight with our allies, divorce America from some of the most important initiatives that we were engaged in, then I think we’re going to have some problems. It’s hard to predict, however, what it’s going to be, but the current trend from the speech that he gave at the United Nations indicates that he intends to pursue a very different set of relationships. And I think it’s going to be very complicated because the world is demanding greater leadership from the United States and from countries as a whole because of the types of challenges we face on a global basis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many things can’t be resolved without engagement with other countries and also without leadership from the United States. This is a very difficult period for a lot of reasons. When you look at the climate change issue, for instance, Donald Trump may have pulled out of the agreement, but the vast majority of countries are staying in the agreement and trying to keep it. It’s a loss to the United States, but it’s also a loss to the world because as every new piece of data is indicating, the challenge of climate change is getting much more difficult, not easier. Paris was never calculated to get the job done completely; it was a start to get the job done. Getting the job done will require major leadership in our country and Donald Trump is moving in the opposite direction.</span>

<b>In the </b><b><i>New York Times Magazine</i></b><b> this summer Nathaniel Rich wrote an essay entitled “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/01/former-secretary-of-state-john-kerry-on-trump-tariffs-the-chinese-do-not--react-well-to-bludgeoning.html_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Losing Earth</a>”</b><b> arguing that democratic societies aren't suited to mitigating climate change because the incentives just aren't there. How would you respond to this position?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s right that the incentives aren’t automatic and easily there, which is why you require leadership. But in fact, the incentives are there, if you are presented with the proper set of choices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealing with climate change is one of the greatest market opportunities we’ve ever had because the solution to the problem of climate change is energy policy. If we would make the right choices about our energy policy, then we could begin to grow our economy in virtuous ways. For instance, getting off of coal-fired power plants to produce electricity is imperative and doable by moving to any number of options including nuclear, which is 100% clean. It’s safe and you could move faster to deal with the problem of climate change. There’s an urgent agenda that is actually job-creating, very good for our economy and good for American economic leadership.</span>

<b>You mentioned on Monday on CNBC that the Chinese “do not react well to bludgeoning” and that the U.S. will have a difficult time negotiating with the country over tariffs</b><b>. What tactics do you feel would be successful in negotiating a trade deal with China?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that tariffs as a last resort can be useful after you have approached a number of different ways to bring the Chinese on board less publicly than beating them over the head because that tends to not get the result you want. Specifically, if the United States were to lay the groundwork with our European allies, rather than alienating them — bringing Europe together as a trading block with the United States and with some others — then you have an enormous amount of economic clout. If you work that together with the WPO, you’re going through a process that makes it easier for the Chinese to respond.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they don’t respond to that, then you always have the virtue of having exhausted a legitimate channel or remedy and taking other action becomes far more understandable, acceptable, palatable and functional. I think that there are other ways to at least exhaust other steps, but if you just leap into a tariff and start to publicly put the Chinese in a corner, it’s harder for the leadership of China to respond in a way that you want them to.</span>

<b>Some have criticized that the Kavanaugh nomination process has displayed how the Senate has strayed from its norms. What are your opinions on the nomination and how do you see the Senate handling future confirmations?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been an extremely unfortunate process. It’s done great damage to the Senate and I think both sides actually bear responsibility for that. I don’t think anyone’s without blame. Neither Christine Blasey Ford nor Brett Kavanaugh were protected in this process and things leaked out that should have been handled more privately.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also think that the abuse by the Republicans of the process itself in terms of timing (and) pressure to rush the nomination with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">out</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> properly investigating it is inexcusable. There’s room for everybody to be upset, and they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upset. Both sides of the aisle, all across political thinking, people are angry about this process.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s done harm to the institution. It’s done harm to the Supreme Court itself, no matter the outcome. It will particularly do harm if Kavanaugh is bum-rush passed and goes to serve.</span>

<b>You’ve hinted several times that you may not be done with politics yet. Are you going to make a run for the 2020 Democratic nomination?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t ruled anything out. I’m really focused on 2018 right now. We have an election in 32 days which is a possibility for a major course correction in this country. We have some terrific candidates running around the country, and I think it’s absolutely vital that people are focused on it. I don’t think (I) ought to be talking about 2020 until we get past this November.</span>

<b>How can the Democratic party engage young people? Do you think there’s a place for a younger leadership within the party?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think younger leadership is absolutely essential not just to the party but to the country. Everything that I saw in my life, which I write about in the book, is a reflection of young people, myself included, being involved in change. We grabbed the mantle of leadership at a period of time where we pushed the civil rights movement, we pushed the peace movement, we pushed environment movement, we pushed women’s ability to break many ceilings and be treated as equal citizens in America. We tried to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Most of the leadership on many of these issues came from young people.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time I’ve done anything in political life, young people have been at the core of those initiatives. One of the things I want to talk about when I come up to Brown is that you can’t ignore the power that is in your individual hands to deal with new things and to get things done.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of the important things that have happened in recent years in our country that have made things better, young things have been at the center. Look at the Parkland students. Look at what happened on guns. Adults walked away, were standing back. It took some young folks to come back and remind people what was really at stake. That’s power. That kind of power can be taken a lot further than it is being right now. We need to talk about that.</span>

<b>Last time you came to campus in 2005 you <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/09/20/kerry-criticizes-bush-response-to-katrina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused your speech on Katrina</a>, among other topics</b><b>. You’re coming to the University on Wednesday — can you give me a preview of what your remarks will look like?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going to talk about the challenge to our democracy and the way in which we’re going to be able to restore what we want in this country. I intend to talk about my book, “Every Day is Extra,” which plays out a roadmap for how we restore what we need to to make things function in America.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve got serious problems, and I’m going to talk about those problems. There’s a level of corruption in our system. There’s excessive ideological extremism that is robbing us (of) the ability to make good decisions, or any decisions. We face very serious global challenges that are not being addressed. I think people are really angry at what is happening because there haven’t been responses to the transformations taking place culturally and economically, and in terms of security.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s just as much on the table as I’ve ever known in political life and I’ve been 28 years in the Senate, four years as Secretary of State. We have to talk about these things and people need to start to mobilize and get active. There are ways and reasons to do that that I intend to talk about when I come to campus.</span>

		<title>Whitehouse, Flanders square off in first TV debate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Incumbent Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse and Republican challenger Robert Flanders ’71 faced off last night in the first televised debate of Rhode Island’s 2018 Senate race. Whitehouse and Flanders answered questions about the economy, President Trump and the recent hearings of Surpeme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh hearings in the WPRI Eyewitness News debate moderated by Ted Nesi of WPRI and Tim White of Target 12.</p>
<p class="p2">The most recent polling favors Whitehouse. Fifty-seven percent of likely voters would vote for Whitehouse, compared to 33 percent for Flanders, according to the <a href="http://app.providencejournal.com/global-assets/scripts/document-cloud-embed.htm?id=4999232-Projo-RIPR-ABC6-RI-Election-Poll-First-of-Three&amp;_ga=2.167522110.1085825041.1539128088-41213093.1533606763">University of New Hampshire Survey Center</a>.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The two candidates enter the playing field with differing levels of prior political experience. Whitehouse was first elected to the Senate in 2006 and has held his seat ever since. Flanders, a former Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice, is running for the Senate for the first time and has never held elected office.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Much of the debate revolved around the Trump administration and the polarized nature of political discourse in Washington. The debate began with questions about Kavanaugh’s recent confirmation hearing. Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was an “early no” vote in the hearing process, The Herald previously reported. Flanders claimed Whitehouse’s performance during the hearings was “an approach of political flatulence,” adding that Whitehouse owed Kavanaugh and his family an apology. Whitehouse fired back, saying that the allegations brought forward in the testimony by Christine Blasey Ford, professor of psychology at Palo Alto State University and research psychologist at Stanford University, warranted serious consideration and questioning.</p>
<p class="p2">The candidates also traded blows over the Trump administration’s foreign policy. Whitehouse said Trump has undermined the country’s position in the international sphere, while Flanders praised the administration’s work to repair the United States’ relationship with North Korea.</p>
<p class="p2">The opioid crisis was also a major point of the debate. Whitehouse touted his ability to work across the aisle, citing the 2016 passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which sought to curb the rising opioid epidemic. Flanders claimed that Whitehouse wasn’t serious about solving the opioid epidemic and alleged that he was receiving major contributions from drug companies.</p>
<p class="p2">The majority of Whitehouse’s donations come from lawyers and law firms, according to the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00027533">Open Secrets Center for Responsive Politics</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Flanders also claimed Whitehouse was guilty of insider trading, referencing a 2012 TV commercial that made the same accusation. The commercial claimed that Whitehouse was given prior information about the 2008 financial collapse and only acted to protect his own financial interests.</p>
<p class="p2">The commercial was funded by People’s Majority, a super PAC formed to oppose Whitehouse, according to Politifact. The organization rated this accusation “<a href="https://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/nov/03/peoples-majority/super-pac-peoples-majority-says-us-sen-sheldon-whi/">Pants on Fire</a>” on its scale of truthfulness.</p>
<p class="p2">The debate also raised local issues, including the construction of the Burrillville power plant. Flanders emphasized his opposition to the plant, citing community concerns about truck traffic and water usage, according to the<a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180906/flanders-opposes-proposed-burrillville-power-plant"> Providence Journal</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">In January 2016, Whitehouse described the Burrillville Power Plant as a necessary solution to a “choke-point” issue of inadequate natural gas supply “in Southern New England,” according to the Providence Journal. But Whitehouse is a longstanding vocal critic of natural gas and fossil fuels. During the debate, he declined to take a side on the power plant, focusing exclusively on national climate policy rather than local issues. This pivot to national policy has been Whitehouse’s stated position on the Burrillville Power Plant since July 2016.</p>
<p class="p2">Flanders said he would not be a strictly partisan vote in Washington. “I’m not going to vote with any party that doesn’t help Rhode Islanders, including the Republican Party,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Whitehouse claimed that Flanders “lines right up with Trump,” and “supports (Trump) on all the things that would hurt Rhode Islanders the most.”</p>
<p class="p2">The general election is set for Nov. 6.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Mayor Jorge Elorza announced plans to resolve the ongoing disruption of student transportation to Providence Public Schools at a press conference Wednesday afternoon. For over a week, Providence school bus drivers — represented by the Teamsters Local 251 union — have been on strike against First Student, the busing company with which Providence previously had a contract.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The bus drivers are on strike to gain pension plans from their employer First Student, according to WPRI. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To put pressure on the Teamsters drivers and First Student, Elorza, along with City Council President David Salvatore, School Board President Nicholas Hemond and Providence Public Schools Superintendent Christopher Maher, stated the city will seek to replace either the drivers or the busing company or both by issuing requests for proposals if a compromise is not reached by the end of the week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Officials will issue three requests for proposals. The first request would seek a company to manage vehicles, personnel and operations; the second would only seek to lease a fleet of school buses; and the third would seek a management company to cover operations and drivers but not buses. The requests for proposals would not include “any mention of the pension,” Elorza said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We cannot continue to put this burden on our community, and it is not fair that our children are being used as collateral in this private dispute,” Elorza said. “We’re hoping that putting out these RFPs is the necessary pressure (to reach a solution) so that … the strike can end, and we can get back to transporting our 9,000 kids everyday.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union initiated legal action against the Providence Public School District on behalf of students with disabilities earlier Wednesday. In response to the ACLU’s class administrative complaint, Maher said, “We believe that the ACLU and Rhode Island Legal Services are acting with our students’ best interest at heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elorza acknowledged that the strike amounts to a crisis, one that would take 150 buses or 150 drivers to solve. Elorza said that no state organizations, universities or private entities could meet the demand for drivers or vehicles. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If the parties do not reach a resolution, an RFP for a new busing arrangement could take months to fulfill. Both First Student and the Teamsters Local 251 drivers could lose the Providence Public School District as a client. “Potentially everybody loses,” Elorza said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We need to find a vendor that can render the services that the kids need,” Hemond said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providence officials have begun conversations with other districts in New England to prevent similar situations from occurring. “I’ve heard the grumblings that ‘It’s Providence this day,’ but this is a dispute that might be played out in maybe other cities potentially in-state and out of state as well.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Low- and middle-income high schoolers in Rhode Island public schools can now earn up to $2,000 as they prepare for college with Rhode2College, a new statewide program that aims to incentivize students to pursue higher education. Over 1,100 students will have received their acceptance letters to Rhode2College from Gov. Gina Raimondo by the end of this week, said Public Information Officer of the Rhode Island Department of Education Meghan Geoghegan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Rhode2College is really about … giving an added push, and sometimes that’s all it takes to get students to the next level to help them consider different possibilities for the future,” Geoghegan said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The new initiative uses students’ PSAT scores in the 10th grade to determine the top 25 percent of students in the Free and Reduced Lunch program across the state, wrote Professor of Economics and International Affairs Justine Hastings in an email to The Herald. Her nonprofit, Research Improving People’s Lives, worked with Raimondo, the Rhode Island Department of Education, the College Board and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative over the past two years to develop Rhode2College.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4">“Rhode2College is designed as a step-by-step, achievement-focused program that breaks down the process of getting to college from a large, daunting task into achievable milestones,” Hastings wrote. “Then it rewards students for achieving those milestones.”</p>
<p class="p4">Rhode2College scholars receive an immediate payout of about $500 in the form of a gift card when they are first admitted to the program. They can get up to $1,500 more over their junior and senior years by taking proactive steps to prepare for college. For instance, students can take free courses to study for the SAT, complete an individualized college plan and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to indicate progress toward their higher education goals, Geoghegan said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An interactive bot texts students with reminders, advice and updates about their earnings for each milestone, which could take the form of a gift card or added money to the scholars’ college savings accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Even though they’re small incentives, … it can actually make a pretty huge difference,” Geoghegan said, adding that the program’s dual approach of offering immediate and long-term payouts should be effective in keeping students on track.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While developing the project, Rhode2College’s creators drew on research in economics and behavioral science that indicates that “individualized assistance and even low-cost incentives … can have comparable results to large-scale scholarship programs,” Hastings wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chair of Education Kenneth Wong said that the initiative is aligned with the state’s “bipartisan commitment” to education and understanding of the phases of “cognitive and social development” of children.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m seeing a system of student support from early childhood all the way to career and college readiness,” Wong said. “This program is situated in that whole landscape of commitment.” He added that Raimondo is now turning her focus from early childhood to high school education<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>through initiatives such as Rhode2College and the Rhode Island Promise Scholarship, which aims to make higher education more affordable.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wong did express concern regarding Rhode2College’s accessibility to students from Rhode Island’s urban school districts, which tend to have large immigrant and first-generation populations. Given the achievement gap that exists between English Language Learners and other students in the state, there’s a risk that low- and middle-income students in urban areas will be underrepresented in the program if they compete with native English speakers, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of the 1,150 eligible students this year, 333 students were accepted from Providence, East Providence and Woonsocket alone — with more scholars from Providence than any other school district. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Currently funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Rhode2College could be implemented as a permanent state-funded program if it is successful in its two-year launch period, Geoghegan said. The state will be paying close attention to the number of participants enrolled in college in order to evaluate Rhode2College’s success.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s an exciting time to be a high school student in Rhode Island,” Geoghegan said. “There’s a lot of opportunities available that weren’t there five years ago.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Student luxury housing developers to save $19 million over 20 years</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On Oct. 4, the Providence City Council approved the use of a tax stabilization agreement for the construction of a new “mixed-use” apartment complex, Edge College Hill II. This agreement will save developers Steeple Street RI, LLC $19 million in taxes over the next 20 years, said Jacqlyn Blatteis ’19, co-director of the student group Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere. The complex, located on Canal Street, will be next to student housing complex Edge College Hill and is advertised as “luxury student apartments,” according to the developers’ website. The building will include 163 studio and one-bedroom apartments, while the first floor will be dedicated to commercial use, according to the Providence Journal. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ben Smith, deputy director of communications for Mayor Jorge Elorza, noted several benefits of the new development and accompanying tax agreement in an email to The Herald. He wrote that tax stabilization agreements are a tool that the city uses to incentivize new development by phasing in taxes “over a number of years, rather than all at once.” Even with the tax agreement, Edge College Hill II is a tax-paying development, and the complex concentrates student housing in high-density zones, which may “alleviate some of the issues associated with students living in lower-density residential areas,” Smith wrote. The city has seen strong growth in student-oriented housing development, “indicating a high demand,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The development and tax agreement have prompted backlash from members of the Providence community. Direct Action for Rights and Equality, a local advocacy group,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>wrote a letter Oct. 4 to the Providence City Council voicing opposition to the tax agreement. The letter urged the City Council to return the proposed tax stabilization agreement to the finance committee for further review. Though the letter was signed by a sitting city councilor, two councilors-elect, the local carpenters union and community advocates and organizers, the Council ultimately approved the tax agreement. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Malchus Mills, vice-chairperson of DARE, has been vocal about the lack of affordable housing in Providence and the city’s inability to address this problem. “Not only here in Rhode Island, but nationally, there is a housing crisis,” Mills said. “We just don’t have enough houses here in Rhode Island, … and we haven’t been building affordable houses for a while,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Mills, with tax stabilization agreements, developers are supposed to pay into a fund to assist low-income residents in the city, but they have failed to do so. “The city is just giving away money because they do not push these large developers to do something for the low-income folks,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“More than 40 percent of Rhode Islanders are housing cost-burdened, meaning that they spend over 30 percent of their income on housing,” Blatteis said. The approval of the tax agreement for Edge College Hill developers “is really indicative of the city’s priorities.” Instead of investing in solutions to help solve the state’s housing crisis, the city is choosing to prioritize “increasing access to luxury student housing,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Katherine Kerwin, who was recently elected to the Providence City Council in Ward 12, signed DARE’s letter. College Hill, which will host the new complex, does not fit the profile of a neighborhood requiring tax stabilization agreements, Kerwin said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tax stabilization agreements are intended to boost economic development; however, the city is using them “not as tools for economic development in communities where we need to be boosting the economy,” but rather to attract “and appease developers in communities that frankly do not need the economic development,” she said. Kerwin said that these tax agreements basically allow developers to evade taxes, “even though our schools are falling apart, our streets need repairing and there are so many basic city-level services that we need to be attending to.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown and the Rhode Island School of Design also play a role in the growth of these expensive developments, as many of the luxury apartments are geared toward their students. “Brown is one of the gentrifiers that has been happening to Providence,” Mills said. In neighborhoods like Fox Point, housing that caters to Brown students is increasingly unaffordable for people who used to live there, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Blatteis also emphasized the impact of the University on the Providence community. She noted that while “as students we might benefit individually from increased off-campus housing options, it’s really important to acknowledge that ultimately student housing displaces permanent Rhode Island residents.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Blatteis urged the University to try to expand off-campus housing options in a way that is transparent with the community as well as “mindful and intentional.” She also hoped students would “not only think about this stuff and be conscious of it,” but also “look for ways to hold Brown accountable,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Blatteis and Mills urge action from the city as well. “The change has to be in the way these (tax stabilization agreements) are enforced. … They’re not adhering to the rules. If the City Council stays the same, I’m afraid it’s always going to be business as usual: The big developers get the tax breaks and the people that are homeless are in poverty,” Mills said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Census dry run faces lack of funding, publicity</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/14/census-dry-run-faces-lack-funding-publicity/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The 2020 Census’ first and only dry run was <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/23/providence-county-test-census-underway/">conducted</a> in Providence County earlier this year. The test run included a new ability to respond to the census through an online survey but did not include the controversial “citizenship question,” which would ask respondents about their U.S. citizenship status. The results from the test will not be published until early next year, according to Census Bureau Public Information Officer Daniel Velez.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In previous years, there has been more than one test before the census roll-out. Originally, the Census Bureau had planned to do three full dry runs — one in Providence County and two others in Washington and West Virginia. Because of years of underfunding, the Bureau had to scale back to one dry run and had no available funds to publicly advertise the census in Providence, said William O’Hare, president of O’Hare Data LLC and Demographic Services.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">City and state officials in Rhode Island were concerned about the lack of preparation and public education for the test run last April, the Providence Journal previously reported.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The City and state of Rhode Island have much to lose should our population fall as a percentage of the national whole; including federal funding for seniors, roads and educational programs, and the state’s representation in Congress could be affected,” wrote Ben Smith, deputy director of communications for Mayor Jorge Elorza, in an email to The Herald. He believes that there will be more advertising when the fully funded census rolls out in 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Facing a lack of funding, national and local organizations — including the Providence Complete Council Committee — stepped up to try to inform the public of the dry run. Among the members of this committee was Secretary of the Portuguese-American Leadership Council of the United States Marie Fraley, who helped troubleshoot problems the test census encountered. Fraley said she used social media and both print and online publications to inform and encourage those in the Portuguese community to participate in the test. She hopes to use the outreach model on a national level in 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providence Complete Council Committee member and Executive Director of Common Cause Rhode Island John Marion said that underfunding is cause for concern. During an event he held last June, Marion asked the Census Bureau for brochures to hand out but was told instead to print out information from the Bureau’s website, as no literature had been prepared.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the Bureau attended all committee meetings and answered all the questions it could, “what was frustrating from the common view point was that they weren’t allowed to do a robust outreach effort,” Marion said. “The community is going to have to stand up and be counted and not wait for the census to come count (them).”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Over half of Providence County responded to the census without a phone call or home visit, and 61 percent of those who responded filled out the census online, according to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2018/dec/providence-rhode-island-thank-you.html">Census Bureau report</a>. Both the response rate on first attempt and internet response rate were higher than the Bureau expected, according to the report.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the online response format will save the Bureau money, some have questioned its effect on rural areas.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There’s a lot of data that shows that rural areas are less likely to be connected or have high speed internet, and so there’s some concern among rural advocates that (by) pushing the internet response, … some people in rural areas may be missed disproportionately,” O’Hare said, adding that it’s a concern for people in any type of community that have limited or no internet access. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The dry run also had a significant omission: the citizenship question. After the test run began in Providence, the Trump administration announced that the question, which asks everyone living in the United States whether they are citizens, would be included in the 2020 Census. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There was a lot of confusion among the public in Providence County about whether the citizenship question was included on the test, which it wasn’t,” Marion said. “The timing was very poor for the purposes of the test.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O’Hare said he worries that the citizenship question could have significant effects on the number of responses to the 2020 Census. In a published report, O’Hare found that since 2010, fewer people have been responding to the citizenship question in the annual American Community Survey, which is also conducted by the Census Bureau. He also found that Hispanic, Asian and non-citizen populations, among others, are <a href="http://www.georgetownpoverty.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GCPI-ESOI-Demographic-Profile-of-People-Who-Do-Not-Respond-to-the-Citizenship-Question-20180906.pdf">less likely to respond</a> to the question. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“My study shows that there is much higher sensitivity to the question on citizenship than there is to other kinds of questions that will be on the 2020 Census, and that sensitivity is very likely to lead to more people not responding to the census,” O’Hare said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Population Studies Michael White said that although the Bureau prepares years in advance for the decennial census, their preparation for the use of the citizen question is inadequate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“From my point of view, I’m quite concerned that this effort was made to include (the citizenship question) in the 2020 Census without testing it fully,” White said, adding that citizenship information can be gathered from other sources. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The census will roll out in April 2020.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University community usage of RIPTA declines</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The University is entering its tenth year as a participant in the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s UPass program. Since the program came to Brown in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2008/05/14/ripta-free-ride-program-a-big-hit-so-far/">2008</a>, students, staff and faculty alike have had free use of RIPTA buses on any route in Rhode Island with a simple swipe of their University ID. The UPass program has provided over 37,000 individuals in the Brown community with almost 3.8 million rides over the course of the past decade.</p>
<p class="p2">The UPass program was created out of necessity to the University, according to Elizabeth Gentry, the assistant vice president for business and financial services. Before UPass, “the University used to subsidize RIPTA ride(s) for a (set) percentage” of the fare, Gentry said. At the time, the University had also recently reduced the number of on-campus student parking spots from around 400 or 500 to 50. “It was time that we provided other options for transportation,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">The University’s agreement with RIPTA stipulates that RIPTA share data on the number of unique riders who use UPass and the total number of rides taken by members of the Brown community. “The numbers (of total riders) are still pretty high, but this past year was the lowest we’ve ever seen,” Gentry said. But the total number of rides taken has increased slightly in the past year from its lowest point in the fiscal year 2016-17.</p>
<p class="p2">Faculty and staff usage numbers also declined considerably in the fiscal year 2016-17; the number of unique riders dropped by over 100 in the past year. Overall, the number of unique riders has consistently declined since fiscal year 2013-14.</p>
<p class="p2">These RIPTA usage numbers can possibly be attributed to the rise of ride-share programs like Uber and Lyft, Gentry said, but she could not confirm if that was the sole reason behind the decline. In The Herald’s spring <a href="http://datascience.heraldweb.org/projects/spring_2015_poll/BDHpoll-spring2015/data/RideSharing/RideSharing.html">2015 poll</a>, 10.9 percent of students polled reported using Uber or Lyft multiple times a week; 20 percent reported using them once a week, while 30 percent reported using the ride-share apps once a month.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite the fall in rider numbers, the University does not foresee a time where they would cancel the UPass program. The old process was “archaic,” Gentry said.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown is not the only school in Rhode Island to take part in the UPass system. “We have UPass agreements with … most private colleges and universities in the state: Bryant, Johnson and Wales, (the Rhode Island School of Design), Roger Williams and Salve Regina,” wrote Director of Public Affairs for RIPTA Barbara Polichetti in an email to The Herald. State schools are currently in discussions with RIPTA for ride programs, and a pilot program opened at the University of Rhode Island in 2017.</p>
<p class="p2">The decline in ridership does not affect RIPTA on a financial level, Polichetti wrote. “RIPTA is a public, nonprofit agency, so all revenue is important. But revenue from ALL fares (not just colleges and universities but all fare revenue generated) represents less than 20 percent of our total revenue. So it’s important because it’s revenue, but fare revenue is less than a quarter of our total revenue stream.”</p>
<p class="p2">While RIPTA may not be financially reliant on students, student ridership is still important because it enables the agency to offer more route options and is “a great way to introduce young adults to public transit use,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">Betsy Shimberg, director of student development at the Swearer Center for Public Service, said she believes RIPTA use is invaluable to a Brown education. “It a) gives you a perspective and lets you understand more about our city, and b) it gives you a chance to reflect on your privilege. You are taking this bus for free. Other people have paid,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">Shimberg emphasized how important RIPTA is for students who engage in direct service within the Swearer Center. Approximately 500 students engage in Swearer Center Community Corps programs, such as Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere, Brown Elementary Afterschool Mentoring and Connect for Health. “They’re engaging in direct service all over the city,” she said. “The privilege … for Brown students to ride the bus for free … really eliminates barriers for people to participate.”</p>
<p class="p2">Former Swearer Center fellow and frequent user of the RIPTA Devra Levy ’19 said she plans on staying in Rhode Island post-graduation. “Losing access to free RIPTA won’t affect my frequency of use because it’s a necessity, but I will have to pay for it which is unfortunate,” she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You don’t realize how much of a privilege it is. We take it for granted.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Trump’s disapproval rating increases in R.I.</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/16/trumps-disapproval-rating-increases-r/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">President Trump’s disapproval rating in Rhode Island hit 61 percent this September — increasing from 46 percent at the start of his term — according to data from Morning Consult. His approval rating suffered a smaller but significant drop from a high of 47 percent in April 2017 to 35 percent this September. The margin of error for the poll is not greater than 3 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Rhode Island is historically a blue state, a trend which continued in the 2016 election. Providence led with an overwhelming turnout of 45,690 blue votes, greater than the total number of red votes from the three biggest cities in the state — Providence, Warwick, and Cranston — according to the New York Times. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In Pawtucket, the fourth largest city in the state and one with a heavy democratic majority, City Councilman Albert J. Vitali Jr. “absolutely, unequivocally” anticipates more voter turnout in the coming elections. The councilman described his constituency as “not very happy” with the Trump administration, citing the Kavanaugh hearing as a touchy subject especially among women in the area. Policies that run counter to their values “would ensure they’re gonna vote Democratic,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Situated in the middle of the Republican bloc in the western part of the state, Coventry<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— the sixth largest town in the state — is also the largest town to have presented a Republican majority in the 2016 presidential election.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Council President Glenford Shibley in Coventry, an R.I. resident since 1969, said he had not personally heard anything negative about the President. He went on to describe Rhode Island as unique, very blue and resistant to change: “I would like to think things are going to change but probably they won’t.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In Burrillville, a Republican majority town, City Councilman John F. Pacheco III expressed a sense of political isolation: “I don’t even watch the news, I don’t pay attention to it, it doesn’t affect me out here.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Chairman of the Burrillville Democratic Town Committee Stephen Mulcahey described possible turning points for local opinion of the President. “I think there’ve been a lot of little ones that’ve led up to the dissatisfaction. I think his war on women has been a very serious issue.” </span></p>
<p class="p2">The town of Johnston also went with the red ticket in the 2016 presidential race. When asked about how the rise in disapproval in his area and how change in public sentiment might affect the coming election, Town Councilman Robert Russo said, “I think you’re definitely gonna mobilize more people.” Russo described issues with the way in which Trump does things. “I think that’s what’s catching up with people. Now (voters are) saying ‘you know what, this is shocking.’”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Superman building has some competition as an icon in the city skyline if New York developer Jason Fane receives approval to build the Hope Point Tower, a 46-story luxury apartment building proposed for downtown Providence. Since January, the City Council and numerous Providence community members have been divided on the subject, questioning the tower’s economic and societal contributions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The proposed location for the tower was once a part of the I-195 highway, but when the highway was moved, land was made available for development. The I-195 Commission recommended that Fane move forward with the project in January, but the proposal is now in the hands of the City Council, said Peter McNally, executive director of the I-195 Redevelopment District Commission. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The area slated for construction is zoned for 100-foot tall buildings, but the Hope Point Tower would be close to 600 feet tall, McNally said. As a result, the Hope Point Tower would require a zoning change, which requires City Council approval, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This zoning change has been a point of controversy for the tower. In July, the City Council’s Committee on Ordinances voted to deny recommending the change, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180718/another-no-vote-for-proposed-46-story-tower-in-providence">reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition, some residents question if there is a market for the luxury apartment complex in Providence. A feasibility study by New Jersey-based Real Estate Solutions Group found that Fane will have to price the luxury apartments at higher than typical Providence rates to make a profit, which suggests that Fane might struggle to find tenants and get a return on his investment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following the findings, Fane said at a I-195 Commission hearing that “we strongly dispute its conclusions.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Marty Saklad, broker at Samson Realty on Wickenden Street, would like to see development of the downtown Providence area and believes the desire to invest is a positive sign for the city, he wrote in an email to The Herald. But Saklad worried that there isn’t a market for more luxury housing in that area.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Maybe we’re wrong and he’ll get a return,” McNally said, “but it’s his money.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dante Bellini, a spokesperson for Fane, said the argument that there is not a market for the luxury housing is “hollow” and perpetuates the false idea that “no one else has the … ability to come into the market” besides those who already own luxury apartments.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“Perhaps a better use could be found for the space,” Saklad wrote. “There are many landlords on the East Side and downtown who may be hurt by excess development that may cannibalize instead of expanding the market.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Professor of American Studies and Urban Studies Samuel Zipp also questioned whether downtown Providence can support multiple luxury apartments. “In general, it would be better for the city if the state kept working toward encouraging housing and business development from the ground up rather than trying to score big projects like this one,” Zipp wrote in an email to The Herald, adding that he would like to see the project push more affordable housing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Including affordable housing in the project is “not on the table for us” and is not right for this project, Bellini said, adding that tax revenue taken from the development would help the city.“The ripple effect (from) this will be quite extraordinary,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Typically, “building more housing brings prices down,” McNally said, adding that the tower could help lower rents in the city.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Overall, McNally does not believe the increase in residential properties itself will spur economic growth. The interest of the commission is to “develop good buildings” with mixed uses, he said. Generally, the commission would be more animated about proposals that facilitate “the creation of knowledge-based industry jobs and advance the buildout of the Innovation District,” McNally wrote in a follow-up email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In the end, it wouldn’t be the end of the world if the tower is built, but I also wonder if it might never get built even if it were approved,” Zipp wrote, describing the project as an “over-the-top scheme” and “obviously out-of-scale” with its surroundings. </span></p>
<p class="p2">“We have a silly history of falling for moon-shotty, one-size-fits-all ideas in economic development when a more human-scaled, gradual and achievable program would be much more successful — if only it could find funders and political sponsors,” Zipp wrote.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When the Superman building was built, it was too big for the area,” Bellini said, adding that it’s still standing today.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Moving forward, the Fane Organization will hold a presentation explaining how their project promotes economic development and the City Council Committee on Ordinances will oversee a public hearing on the project Oct. 22 at City Hall.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs hosted a panel of political commentators Thursday night to discuss the Rhode Island midterm elections. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Visiting Assistant Professor of Education Hilary Levey Friedman moderated as Assistant Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University at Newark Domingo Morel PhD ’14, Adjunct Professor of International and Public Affairs Robert Hackey PhD ’92 and WPRO radio host Dan Yorke discussed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>key election races and Rhode Island’s loss of the Pawtucket Red Sox, among other topics. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The governor’s race and the senate race both seem “pretty safe right now for the Democrats,” Morel said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hackey, Yorke and Morel agreed that should the speaker of the House change as a result of the midterm election, Rhode Island politics could change significantly. “The speaker really has control of the purse strings, and the speaker really dictates what happens to the governor’s agenda,” Hackey added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The incumbent Rhode Island Speaker of the House Nicholas Mattiello has struggled to preserve a “conservative flavor of the Democratic party … against the progressive left,” Yorke said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hackey suggested that the midterm election is “really hinging upon” the status of the Rhode Island economy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the announcement of the loss of the PawSox to Worcester in August — which has largely been blamed on Gov. Gina Raimondo by her Republican challenger Allan Fung — Hackey noted that he doesn’t “see a lot of finger-pointing happening” among officials running in the upcoming election. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Panelists also discussed the implications of the recently resolved Providence bus driver strike on local politics. When confronted with demands from the bus driver union for pensions, “What do you do as a mayor or as a governor?” Yorke asked, “The state pension issue has been somewhat resolved. The real ticking time bomb is the municipal pension problems that exist.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An imminent challenge facing the state is the fact that Rhode Island’s population is decreasing, Hackey said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friedman noted that Rhode Island risks losing one of its two seats in the House of Representatives if the population does not stabilize. As of December 2017, Rhode Island was within 157 residents of losing a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>House seat, WPRI reported. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The midterm election is set for Nov. 6. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Research reveals Providence socioeconomic divisions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3"> Whether by confirming visible disparities or exposing new ones, a new data-based map titled “Opportunity Atlas” uses decades of income data on residents to illustrate the difference a neighborhood can make on a child’s future income — in Providence and throughout the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Researchers investigated how a low-income child’s neighborhood — isolated from parental income, education or other factors — can predict their average annual household earning as an adult, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/11/opportunity-insights-helps-craft-policy/">previously reported</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Over the course of 18 months, Associate Professor of Economics John Friedman co-led a team of researchers from the University, Harvard and the U.S. Census Bureau that broke down income predictions on the level of a tract, a geographic area that contains an average of 4,000 people as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Opportunity Atlas’ dataset, Providence exemplifies national trends in urban inequality.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Sociology John Logan said the study “reinforces patterns that we were familiar with” but adds a new perspective by focusing on the mobility of children over time — and doing so with an extensive dataset from the Internal Revenue Service.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Inequality in Providence has a long history: Its manufacturing industry began to deteriorate in the 1950s, which burdened the city’s economy, Logan said. The city then “became a magnet for immigration because of the high vacancies and the low rent,” he added. Over time, these economic and demographic changes have compounded so that Providence’s poverty center has “deepened.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Altogether, “Providence, despite this progressive political base, is among the most unequal cities in the country,” Logan said. While many other cities have also seen declines in manufacturing industries and increases in immigration over the last decades, Providence is one of the few to have simultaneously experienced growth concentrated in prosperous areas — such as College Hill and the East Side, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The data show that very few children from low-income families live on College Hill at all — just 12 out of 207 children are from low-income families in the tract west of Thayer Street, and about 21 out of 152 reside in the tract to the east. These numbers are too low for conclusive income predictions to be made for low-income children inhabiting these tracts. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For children from middle-income families on College Hill, where they grew up with respect to Thayer Street makes a difference to their economic prospects. While students from middle-income families west of Thayer Street are predicted to make $68,000 in annual household income, the prediction stands at just $42,000 immediately to the east.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Data on income predictions from families at all socioeconomic levels capture the division between the peak affluence on College Hill and the bleaker prospects of the rest of the city. In the tract that includes many of the University’s and Rhode Island School of Design’s academic buildings, children are predicted to make $72,000 in annual household income. In the neighboring tract, on the other side of North Main Street that includes Providence Place Mall, the Rhode Island State House and Kennedy Plaza, chances are that children will grow up to make $41,000 (though this estimate is based on only 60 children).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The dataset “doesn’t allow us to identify the causal effects of university mobility,” said Harvard predoctoral fellow and Opportunity Atlas researcher Jack Hoyle. He added that this could be an area for future research.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University “can be perceived as a progressive force, helping to revitalize the city, or it can be seen as participating in a kind of growth whose benefits will be reaped by some kinds of people and not others,” Logan said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providence’s downtown neighborhoods offer children the worst chances for future incomes in the city, especially further south, according to Opportunity Atlas. The lowest estimate corresponds to a tract in downtown Providence, just south of Federal Hill, where 758 children from low-income families, defined as at or below the 25th percentile for income, are predicted to have $23,000 annual household salaries as adults. In an adjacent tract, just single street south, that prediction rises to $29,000, based on data from about 2,100 children. Many adjacent tracts have disparities of about $2,000, which is approximately the margin of error of Opportunity Atlas general income estimates. Predictions tend to stay below $30,000 throughout downtown Providence tracts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The most drastic disparities can be found northwest of the city, where hard lines between tracts trace divisions as great as $10,000 between some affluent suburbs and the rest of the city. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Divisions between tracts and minimum predicted income become more stark when accounting for differences in ethnic groups, both locally and nationally. In Providence city center, black low-income residents of Smith Hill are projected to make $28,000, compared to just $12,000 in adjacent Federal Hill. Low-income Hispanic children in Elmhurst have a predicted household income of $69,000, whereas in Wanskuck the prediction for Hispanic children amounts to less than a third of this at $22,000.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nationally and locally, no single explanation exists for divisions between neighborhoods. While some suggest that schools are determining factors, Hoyle stressed that they “don’t explain everything.” He noted that Providence has a school choice system which means neighborhoods do not necessarily directly correspond with specific schools.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Logan hypothesized that neighborhood disparities are influenced by “our usual measures of advantage and resources, which are the quality of the elementary school the children who live there go to, the crime rate in the very local neighborhood, the poverty rate, the percent of residents who have a college degree or a high school degree, the racial composition, the percent who are immigrants (and) the percent who speak English well,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The interests of those who control public policy could complicate attempts to unite behind the new data for progressive change, Logan explained. “Those who are advantaged in the current system have no incentive to change it, and those who are disadvantaged have no influence over policy. So there’s a lot of talk about it, but not very much action,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“You may change the neighborhood and get rid of some poor people and replace them with more affluent people, but it’s not exactly attacking poverty,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hoyle said academics and municipal leaders have expressed interest in the study and its implications for concrete policy action. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Mayors throughout the country will tell you that there is a growing concern about income and wealth inequality in cities throughout America, but for too long we have been lacking the tools to meaningfully measure how our cities fare in terms of mobility,” wrote Deputy Director of Communications for Mayor Jorge Elorza Ben Smith in an email to The Herald. He added that the new available data will help inform Elorza’s team when making decisions regarding “deeper investments in initiatives that promote social and economic mobility here in Providence.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The responsibility for disparities belongs to “all levels of government,” Logan said. He cited housing vouchers, an increase in construction of affordable housing, combating discrimination in housing and investment in schools as starting points for improving poor neighborhoods. Moving people to better neighborhoods should supplement these strategies, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This study “increases the pressure; the more visibility it gets, the better,” Logan said. “I’m so glad they did this study; I’m so glad it got reported in the New York Times. There should be more.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Carlos Carrillo, a 29-year-old former Uber driver, was charged with the second-degree sexual assault of Vanessa Garcia ’20.5 hours after reportedly assaulting her during an Uber ride near campus Aug. 2. Carrillo has posted bond is currently in the midst of pre-arraignment counseling, according to court records. Carrillo has a No Contact Order with Garcia.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Herald does not typically name alleged survivors of sexual assault, but Garcia requested that her name appear in this story as a sign of empowerment and an acknowledgement of her work as an advocate for survivors of sexual assault. With Garcia’s guidance and involvement, the University released “Tips for using Uber and Lyft” Oct. 1. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I want to give a face and a voice to the ‘anonymous 21-year-old victim’ that people were victim shaming in the WPRI article about my assault,” Garcia wrote in a statement to The Herald on her decision to have her name appear in this story.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Herald interviewed Garcia in August but delayed publication of the story in an effort to reach Carrillo for comment. Garcia criticized The Herald’s decision to contact Carrillo at a rally Sept. 29, The Herald previously reported. It is The Herald’s policy to reach out to those charged with serious crimes for comment when reporting a news story in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of events. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Carrillo’s only listed contact information is his residential address. He did not respond to a letter from The Herald requesting comment. His public defender, Jason Ollman, refused to comment. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Garcia reported being “inappropriately touched” by Carrillo, according to police records. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“What the rider reported to police is appalling and wrong. This driver no longer has access to the app, and we will support the police investigation,” a spokesperson for Uber wrote in an email to The Herald, adding that Carrillo had no previous reports “of this nature.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Uber drivers are expected to comply with the company’s <a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/community-guidelines/us-en/">community guidelines</a>, which include a clause forbidding sexual contact when using the platform. “As a reminder, Uber has a no sex rule. That’s no sexual conduct between drivers and riders, no matter what,” the guide reads. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/30/technology/uber-driver-sexual-assault/index.html">CNN investigation</a> in April revealed that at least 103 Uber drivers in the United States have been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers in the past four years. At least 31 of these drivers have been convicted, according to the investigation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Providence Police Public Information Officer Lindsay Lague wrote in an email to The Herald that the incident between Garcia and Carrillo is one of the first complaints about an Uber driver in relation to a student in recent memory. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Garcia’s ride began at 12:24 a.m. from Thayer Street and was a two-destination trip. At the first stop, Garcia allowed Carrillo to use her bathroom while she waited outside for him, according to the report. As the ride resumed, Carrillo “insisted on her sitting in the passenger seat,” Garcia told the police.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While she was in the front seat, Carrillo asked her if she had a boyfriend and began to “stroke her legs and chest area,” according to the report. Garcia told him to stop and he started “touching her groin area.” He then stopped the car and attempted to climb on top of Garcia. She cried no repeatedly and Carrillo responded “Okay, I won’t,” according to the report. He returned to his seat but rested his hand on her chest area as he drove, the report stated. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Carrillo then drove Garcia to her final destination. As she fumbled with her belongings before entering the house, Carrillo came up behind her on the doorstep, grabbed her from behind and began “grinding against her” while feeling her chest, according to the report. After she opened the door, Carrillo “demand(ed) her phone number,” the report stated. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Garcia said she gave Carrillo a five-star rating after the incident to avoid filling out the comment box that is required if dolling out a low review — and to keep herself safe. “If I rated him one star, his rating would go down and he knew where I lived. I just wanted him out of my life,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The investigation transferred from the University’s Department of Public Safety to the Providence Police that night. “The student initially contacted Brown DPS. Once the department was made aware of the circumstances, they contacted the Providence Police Department to investigate,” Executive Assistant for Brown DPS Kate Felder wrote in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DPS refers the “majority of serious crimes occurring on campus and streets adjacent to the campus” to the Providence Police, DPS Deputy Chief of Police Paul Shanley wrote in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following the incident, Garcia has struggled to find her new normal, she said. She has worked with a Sexual Harassment and Assault Resource and Education advocate to find new forms of transportation and to discuss how to best work with a detective. She no longer uses Uber “because I have trauma from using rideshare apps and can no longer trust strangers like that,” Garcia said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Garcia decided to be named in The Herald despite comments on previous media coverage that blamed her for the assault, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Comments blam(ed) me for getting assaulted because I agreed to sit in the front (seat), and statements (claimed) that if I were to be raped in my own house because I let him use the bathroom, that would also be my own fault,” she wrote in a follow-up statement to The Herald. “I am sick and tired of people 1) thinking that it is in any way MY fault or burden to bear as a survivor and 2) that those comments don’t affect anyone. After reading these comments in the detective’s office, I remember bursting out in tears and wanting to just disappear from this society. Your blaming of victims matters and it hurts. Do better.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Garcia hopes her experience helps University students stay safe when using ridesharing apps. “Tips for using Uber and Lyft” suggests avoiding riding in the front seat, among other pieces of advice. “At a bare minimum, don’t take rideshares alone,” Garcia said. “Use safety apps so you can send tracking to your friends, and don’t get in the front seat if you get bad vibes from someone.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University recommends The Brown Guardian Mobile Safety App, which was updated June 27 and includes instant location sharing and streaming, a two-way text option with Public Safety and a content portal for University Campus Safety information. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Brown community members affected by sexual assault can call the Sexual Assault Response Line at 401-863-6000 or visit the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/health/services/sexual-assault-resources">Health Services website</a> for more details.</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A large crowd of people spilled into the hallways of Providence City Hall at Monday night’s City Council meeting to discuss the biggest news in town — the proposed 46-story Hope Point Tower project that has divided the city.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The City Council’s Committee on Ordinances held a public hearing to give Jason Fane, the building’s developer, and the people of Providence a chance to speak about the project. The tower — which will host luxury apartments, restaurants and retail stores — is slated to be the tallest building in the city and would be built on former I-195 land downtown. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Monday’s meeting was only a public hearing, but the Committee will make a recommendation to the City Council on whether or not to approve a zoning change that would be necessary to construct the building. Fane is attempting to build the 600-foot-tall building in a lot designated for 100-foot-tall buildings. This maximum height restriction was set by a <a href="https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Planning-ProvidenceTomorrowFinal_November2014.pdf">comprehensive zoning plan</a> completed three years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At Monday’s meeting, the crowd was vocal and divided. Committee Chair Terrence Hassett from Ward 12 warned the crowd several times that he would have to ask people to leave if they were too loud and pounded his gavel often throughout the meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">People wearing safety green windbreakers, Carhartt sweatshirts and work boots were prominent among in the crowd. Dozens of union laborers turned out in support of the building because Fane has committed to using one hundred percent union labor for the project. The tower is projected to create 15,000 jobs, according to Edward Mazze, professor of business administration at the University of Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mazze gave a presentation in support of the tower, saying that he believed it would be a positive addition to the city. “First of all, this could make Downtown Providence’s economy boom. Second, it could make Providence more vibrant,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mazze acknowledged that many of the jobs created would be in construction, which would result in a temporary boost to the economy. But the building will create jobs long after its completion in building management, retail and hospitality, he noted. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Only 3.7 percent of Providence’s rental units are unoccupied, Mazze said. This indicates that there is a market for the tower’s apartments, which could cater to college students and recent graduates. The building will contribute huge revenue for the city, Mazze added, saying non-property tax revenue during construction is estimated to amount to $12.7 million.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Think of what that would do for Providence,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Following Mazze’s presentation, Friedrich St. Florian, architect of the WWII memorial on the National Mall, spoke in favor of the current design and height of the building. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Florian noted that mid-sized cities, and university cities in particular, offer a high quality of life that could attract a wealthy demographic. In his opinion, many attributes of Providence could draw people to the city, including hospitals, restaurants, walkable streets and the “bicycles and scooters,” a nod to jump bikes and ride-sharing scooters. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He urged the Council to change the zoning ordinance. “City ordinances are indeed useful planning tools to safeguard public interest as a vision at the particular time for the foreseeable future, but they are not cast in stone. They are scaffolding.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fane’s land-use attorney William Landry said that the building was in accordance with the spirit of the comprehensive zoning plan, even if it required a change to the zoning ordinance. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While critics of Fane’s proposal have cited it as an example of spot zoning — when zoning laws are circumvented for the benefit of a single development — Landry said that the City Council has discretionary power to decide the height of buildings. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Landry reminded the audience that the building’s aesthetics were not the subject of the hearing. “Design is an issue for another day,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Fane presentation concluded with words from Jason Fane himself, who said that he believes the building would benefit the city by bringing housing, tax revenue, jobs and economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I have great faith in Providence,” Fane said, adding that he would invest $300 million from his personal funds to realize the project. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After the Fane Organization’s 50-minute presentation<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>—<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>which was originally supposed to be a half hour — the floor was opened to the public. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The majority of the speakers were against the tower.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I see the appeal of a large investment. … However, I strongly urge you to vote no for this proposal in its current location,” said Executive Secretary of the Fox Point Neighborhood Association Amy Mendillo. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mendillo asked the Council to respect the comprehensive zoning plan. “The comprehensive plan is working” and incorporated the community’s vision for the city, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">James Hughes, founder of Boston Andes Capital, said that his firm has invested money in projects in the city but will leave if the tower is built. Other investors — who, like Hughes, have had to comply with the comprehensive plan in the past — will leave with him, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Hope Point Tower “has the ability to arrest other developments,” Hughes said, since apartment units in the tower will likely be priced much higher than other housing in the city. “We don’t want to reinvent Providence, we want to restore it.” </span></p>
<p class="p4">Paul MacDonald, president of the Providence Central Labor Council, which represents 29,000 union workers, said that he supports the project and feels that it is a move toward progress.</p>
<p class="p4">Mentioning the Dunkin Donuts Center, Providence Place and even the Superman building, MacDonald said that people had previously been worried of large, new construction, but that they ultimately proved to be positive projects. “If we’re not going to build, we’re not going to move,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">MacDonald wasn’t the only one to make mention of Providence’s most iconic building. Several individuals pointed out the Superman building’s vacancy, and asked Fane and the city to reinvest in the 90-year-old building to grow the economy instead of building something new.</p>
<p class="p4">The meeting took a different turn when Al Sapienza, star of The Sopranos and Brotherhood, got up to speak and introduced himself to Hassett with the words, “I played your mayor on Brotherhood.” Sapienza explained that he currently lives in Fane’s most recent project in Toronto.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Calling Fane a “great guy,” he said it’s not often that you become friends with the developer of the building you live in. Sapienza said that the project in Toronto faced community criticism too, but that after it was built it changed the neighborhood. “I think it’s a gift to have somebody come to your city … and want to build,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many people advocated a for a compromise on the design, including Dianne Witman, independent candidate for governor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We should not say no because of the current design’s shortcomings,” Witman said. “I believe a compromise can be struck. We must not stand in the way of progress.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The three-and-half hour meeting went “as expected,” said Dante Bellini, a spokesperson for Fane. They were “happy about what they presented,” which were the facts, he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When asked if Fane would consider changing the design of the building, Bellini said, “We have no obligation to build something that somebody else wants.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>R.I. mail-in ballots increase from 2014 to 2018 gubernatorial election</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Forty-one percent more voters applied for regular mail-in ballots in 2018 than in the 2014 gubernatorial election, the Rhode Island Board of Elections reported Tuesday. Since the last gubernatorial election, use of emergency mail-in ballots, which can be applied for up until the day before the election, has increased by 107 percent.</p>
<p class="p4">The Board of Elections attributes this spike to the allowance of “no-excuse” mail-in ballots. Prior to a 2012 policy change, Rhode Island required that voters provide justification to receive a mail-in ballot. Some of the limited excuses considered valid included illness or impairment of mobility, confinement to a hospital or nursing home or being temporarily absent from the state. Now, voters first send in a ballot application with a signature and mailing information, then receive their ballot in the mail.</p>
<p class="p4">Populations who may have trouble getting to the polls or being present on election day, such as those who work two jobs or lack access to reliable transportation, can more easily access voting via mail-in ballots, said Vice Chairman of the Board of Elections Stephen Erickson.</p>
<p class="p4">“A lot of campaigns have figured out that mail ballots are a way to ensure that populations that may have some difficulty getting to the poll have an opportunity to vote,” Erickson said. “When you tie together the mail ballots and what we’d like to see (from) early voting, what we’re doing is trying to expand the universe of ways in which people can make sure that they can exercise their franchise.”</p>
<p class="p4">Though the Board of Elections does not collect voter demographics, members suggested that Rhode Island natives who attend universities far from their home polling locations could benefit from the mail-in ballot.</p>
<p class="p4">“Especially for students who are still registered back at their home addresses, this is a very effective way to make sure that they can participate in the franchise,” Erickson said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An Exeter, Rhode Island native, Brianna McFadden ’20<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>noted that her hometown’s polling station does not have a RIPTA line accessible from Brown. McFadden would have to rely on her father to drive her for 30 minutes to the polls without a mail-in ballot. </span></p>
<p class="p4">“I (used a mail-in ballot) in the 2016 election too,” McFadden said. “For me at least it was a pretty simple process.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Rhode Island Secretary of State’s office secured funding this year to pay the return postage for all mail-in ballots to decrease the strain on voters even further, said Robert Rapoza, executive director of the Board of Elections. The mail-in ballots can also prevent long wait times and extreme lines at the polling stations, especially if the ballot in question is lengthy, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">“We had one town two years ago that had over 40 referendum questions on the ballot,” Rapoza said. “If you weren’t prepared, you would be at that polling place a long time, and it would back up the voting because people are in the voting booth. What the town did was they mailed (mail-in ballot) applications and the questions to the voter encouraging them to do mail-in ballots.”</p>
<p class="p4">McFadden attested to lines as well: Even in a 6,000 person town at 6 a.m., when she went to vote at the primaries in high school, the line was long. Not by “Providence standards,” she said, “but for me it was kind of a long line. Like, ‘I hope to get to school on time.’”</p>
<p class="p4">But mail-in ballots pose their own difficulties. Voters must also be sure to correctly fill out the ballot envelope, which asks voters to include their own signature along with the signature of either two witnesses or a notary, said Miguel Nunez, deputy director of elections. In 2014, almost 1,100 ballots were voided because of a problem with these parameters.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’ve had notaries notarize non-existent signatures,” Rapoza said. Some voters forget witness or notary signatures, and others still submit mail-in ballots with signatures on the ballot itself that do not match the application for the ballot.</p>
<p class="p4">“It was very clear in a number of cases that somebody’s parent had signed the application to send the ballot to school somewhere,” Erickson said. “That’s a no-no. Make sure you sign your own ballot application.”</p>
<p class="p4">New 2018 rules and regulations institutionalize a process that returns faulty ballots to voters and gives them seven days to correct their ballot and return it before Nov. 6, Nunez said.</p>
<p class="p4">Officials tested the ballot correction process during the September primaries, but the Board of Elections reported that few voters took advantage of the opportunity. Two hundred thirty-eight voters were alerted of the need to fix their ballot, and the Board of Elections received 13 back.</p>
<p class="p4">The Board of Elections made multiple other efforts to facilitate voter participation and reduce wait times at polling stations. During the primaries, each precinct used one DS-200, an electronic machine that tabulates paper ballots. The most heavily populated precincts will have two or in rare cases three machines for the general election. To expedite voter check-in, the Board of Elections also deployed electronic poll books in place of paper ones. Nunez said that 131 field technicians will also work on election day — a 323 percent increase in field technicians used since 2014 — to ensure that increased dependence on technology will not go awry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ed. Department receives $2.5 million grant</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/25/ed-department-receives-2-5-million-grant/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The U.S. Department of Education awarded the Rhode Island Department of Education a federal grant of $2.5 million last week to finance measures to meet public school students’ social and emotional needs. The grant complements a $9 million federal grant awarded in early September to expand mental health resources, said RIDE Communications Director Megan Geoghegan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Grants of this size do not come around “that often. This is pretty big money,” Geoghegan said. While it is more common for the department to receive grants ranging from $500,000 to $1 million, “to get in the multimillions is not super common,” she explained. Every state tends to apply for federal grants, which creates competition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chair of Education Policy Kenneth Wong noted that the grant adds statewide support to the Providence Public School Department’s investment in social and emotional learning.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The federal grant provides critically important and timely resources for PPSD’s SEL initiative, given the need for professional support in this area,” Wong wrote in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The grant’s focus on social and emotional learning reflects the state’s increased attention to how student well-being impacts academic outcomes. Social and emotional learning “is something that is getting a lot more attention now than in the past few years,” Geoghegan said. “A lot of state education agencies (and) a lot of school districts are paying attention to it, so I’m not surprised that it would be a competitive landscape with this particular grant.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both national and statewide surveys show “that students (now) tend to be more stressed than they have in years past,” Geoghegan said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This grant was written so that there would be a particular focus for children with or at risk of behavioral health issues, including substance use disorders,” Geoghegan added, though ideally it will benefit all students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Office of Student, Community and Academic Supports within RIDE obtained the grant, Geoghegan said. The team crafted a proposal and received approval within just four weeks, she added in a follow-up email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">RIDE will distribute funding to districts rather than to individual schools, a decision meant to create robust infrastructure that will endure after the grant’s money dries up, Geoghegan said. RIDE has not yet determined how it will distribute this funding across districts or which districts will be selected, she wrote in a follow-up email to The Herald, adding that these processes would be clarified around the beginning of November.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Different districts will have different needs that must be individually assessed and addressed, Geoghegan added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She hopes some of the funding will be used to expand programs already in place, such as Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, which structures “positive reinforcement and how you reward good behavior. … So, those programs already exist; however, we’re going to scale them up,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">RIDE partnered with the Center for Leadership and Educational Equity and the Northern Rhode Island Collaborative to design a proposal for the grant. Through this proposal, the collaborators will primarily aid “professional development,” an initiative that will likely account for “a really significant piece” of how the grant is used, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">CLEE will be working with nine schools across districts to explore different approaches to social and emotional learning measures, said CLEE Executive Director Donna Braun. CLEE will begin by working with groups of students who have been underserved and “then start to move … to the larger school community,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Braun explained that CLEE’s idea of professional development has its own twist: Whereas traditional professional development involves workshops and discussion where participants “are learning from content,” CLEE works to bring “teams’ leaders together in more of a networking format for people to learn from each other,” Braun said. She added that this technique helps schools discover their own problems and solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The most challenging aspect of improving SEL in schools is not figuring out which programs to implement, but figuring out how to change everyday practice, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is “incredibly significant for Rhode Island,” Braun said, because it acknowledges the quality of what the state’s educational institutions already have to offer. CLEE recognizes teachers as “highly skilled professionals who have an immense, endless capacity to learn and improve together.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Support of social and emotional education is essential to improve the quality of students’ academic experiences, Braun said. “The things we can do to improve social-emotional learning and mental health are the things that will help students” with their academic performances, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Geoghegan concurred. “There’s a recognition that if we’re not caring for the whole student, then we can’t possibly support them academically. If a student doesn’t feel safe, if they don’t feel supported, if they’re anxious all the time, that’s going to affect their achievement as well; really, one has to come with the other, and there’s a growing recognition of that,” she said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nordstrom to close at Providence Place</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nordstrom announced last Tuesday that it will be closing its Providence branch Jan. 4. The first store to open at Providence Place Mall and one of the mall’s remaining anchor stores, Nordstrom will be replaced with Boscov’s, a family-owned department store, which will open in fall 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We look at our business market-by-market to understand where we have opportunities to grow … while also being as efficient as possible in serving our customers,” President of Stores Jamie Nordstrom said in a press release posted to the Nordstrom’s website. “When we look at our business in the Providence market, we determined it made most sense to end our Providence Place lease.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Providence Place Nordstrom store opened in August 1999 and was the mall’s very first tenant. The store’s closure will affect approximately 187 non-seasonal employees, according to the press release. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve been fortunate to serve customers here for nearly 20 years and have built meaningful relationships with our customers and community in that time,” Nordstrom said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The company’s decision to close the location is “really about how we can best serve customers in the Providence market,” said Nordstrom Spokesperson Emily Sterken in an interview with The Herald. The Nordstrom Rack in the Warwick Mall will remain open, and customers can continue to shop on Nordstrom’s website. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Boscov’s department store will move into the mall next fall, said Lindsay Kahn, a spokesperson for the Chicago-based real estate firm and Providence Place owner Brookfield Properties Retail Group, as reported by WPRI. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When an opportunity presents itself, it just makes sense to go into a market that we feel would like a Boscov’s,” said Boscov’s Chairman and CEO Jim Boscov to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Boscov’s is based in Reading, Pennsylvania, with locations in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Providence Place location will be the first in Rhode Island. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Boscov said that the company is distinctive for its mission “to be a member of the community.” The store’s prices are “sharper than anything people have seen in the past,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re still your neighborhood family store,” Boscov said. “We believe that having people there to help provide excellent service is what differentiates us from the others.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Upon opening, Boscov’s will hire about 300 local people who “know what the community needs,” Boscov said. The company has a vested interest in community involvement and lasting partnerships with local nonprofit organizations, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The closing of Nordstrom is part of a larger trend in retail, Deputy Director of Communications at the City of Providence Benjamin Smith wrote in an email to The Herald. As more customers shop online, brick-and-mortar stores will have to continue to adapt, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“As a city, we’re encouraged by the fact that there is already another tenant in place and believe that shows that Providence is a place where people want to live, work and play,” Smith wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Former mayor of Providence Joseph Paolino said that Nordstrom and major retailers like it were key to attracting tourists and shoppers to Providence. “With Nordstrom leaving, I think it’s a fatal blow to the Providence Place Mall,” Paolino said. “Replacing it with another retailer isn’t the solution because it’s the wrong retailer.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Boscov maintains that the store will appeal to a wide range of consumers and enhance the vibrancy of the mall. “We carry all the famous labels, … but we carry a much broader range of products, which means that we’ll appeal to a much broader range of individuals,” Boscov said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before Providence Place was built, Paolino, then-mayor Vincent “Buddy” Cianci Jr. and then-governor Bruce Sundlun went to Seattle — where Nordstrom is based — to convince the Nordstrom family to bring the store to Providence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This was the first time in many years that Providence was going to be the home of major retail,” Paolino said. When Nordstrom leaves, Macy’s will be the mall’s only remaining flagship establishment before Boscov’s comes in. Nordstrom’s departure reflects a negatively changing city dynamic, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Providence is a downtown you can celebrate,” Paolino said. “But when you see a store of Nordstrom’s caliber closing, … it’s going to definitely change the feel of the city.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Paolino also criticized the city administration’s lack of involvement in working to keep Nordstrom in Providence. “This is what being Mayor is all about,” he said. “(Nordstrom’s closing) should not have happened. … When you don’t communicate with people, things happen that you don’t expect.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When asked how the Mayor’s office works with local retail owners, Chief of Communications and Senior Advisor to the Mayor Emily Crowell wrote that the administration communicates with Providence Place Mall owners and tenants “when necessary,” in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The city was not informed of the closure or reason for closure,” she wrote.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Electric scooters made their return to Providence earlier this month with rideshare companies Bird and Lime. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last July, Bird’s surprise overnight debut encountered pushback after the scooters interrupted traffic flow and obstructed sidewalks. Bird subsequently discontinued the service to be compliant with Department of Public Works policy while the department began work on new regulations for electric scooters in the city. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The department’s new rules — released in August — regulate the placement and use of electric scooters over the course of a year-long trial period. According to the policy, there can be no more than 300 active scooters within the city, and the “fleets” must be distributed evenly throughout Providence’s five districts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The City tried to “ensure that the zones pushed scooter companies to provide mobility access to Providence residents with an eye to both racial and income equity,” wrote Ben Smith, deputy director of communications for Mayor Jorge Elorza, in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These goals tie into the affordability programs offered by the services; Lime and Bird both have discounts available for those who participate in any state or federally run assistance program, according to the company websites. Bird’s programs, also available to active and retired military personnel, eliminate the $1 flat-ride fee, so a ride would cost $0.15 per minute. Lime’s program cuts the cost of scooter rides by 50 percent, which allows for cheaper long rides, and participants may pay in cash at PayNearMe locations, according to its website. “Improving access to low-cost transportation solutions and reducing costs associated with car ownership are essential to reducing household transportation costs for Providence residents,” Smith wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Department of Public Works’ policy also re-iterates ordinances against obstructing the public right-of-way to prevent scooters from being parked and tipped over in front of residences and businesses. Scooters are now equipped with instructions on proper parking and outfitted with tip-over sensors. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In line with the policies introduced with the bike-share programs, Lime and Bird also “must agree to share all data with the City at no cost in order to be eligible for authorization,” Smith wrote. This data is important for developing apps such as the Transit App, ensuring companies comply with regulations and informing future planning decisions on public use of the scooters. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, 90 percent of the city’s emissions come from diesel and gasoline, but Elorza has set a goal for Providence to become carbon neutral by 2050. As the trial period for the scooters moves forward, environmental groups in the city will assess the scooters’ effect on carbon emissions. The Office of Sustainability of the City of Providence is looking to update their greenhouse gas inventory for next year and will be able to assess the impact of the ridesharing services in greater detail after the report is released, said Municipal Energy Manager Dino Larson. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bird and Lime spokespeople could not be reached for comment by press time. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Interfaith vigil mourns Tree of Life victims</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following the recent mass shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, hundreds of Rhode Islanders gathered in an interfaith vigil outside the Jewish Alliance of Greater Rhode Island headquarters Monday evening. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Impassioned Jewish, Muslim and Christian leaders led prayers and disavowed hateful rhetoric but also implored politicians and their community members to take action to implement gun control reforms. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I am haunted by this question — what else can the faith community do?” said Rev. Donnie Anderson, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches. “In the spirit of our prophetic tradition … I ask our political leaders to be leaders of courage … (and) to pass meaningful gun legislation that might mitigate the American tragedy of gun violence.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The crowd stretched across Elmgrove Avenue, cupping flames of candles in their palms and murmuring assent to the messages of love and communion that flowed from the speakers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Look at everyone here, all around you, bearing light,” said Rabbi Sarah Mack of Temple Beth-El synagogue. “This is how we combat hate. By standing together, from across our communities, with unity. Together, we move forward to spread love and pursue peace.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Projecting the ethos of solidarity, Mufti Ikram Ul-Haq represented the Masjid Al-Islam mosque in Smithfield, Rhode Island. “I would like to say to my Jewish brothers and sisters, when someone expresses animus toward you, it is directed toward all of us,” Ul-Haq said. “When someone attacks you, it is an attack on all of us. We will always stand by you, in good times and bad.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jakob Wells ’19 and several other students who were part of congregations that met at the Tree of Life synagogue lit candles for the 11 members killed in the shooting. The lights represented individual victims like Bernice and Sylvan Simon, who were married 60 years ago at the synagogue. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Events like this one tonight have given me the conviction that we as communities can overcome and rise against the hate and bigotry with compassion and move forward and survive and heal together” Wells said as a member of the Dor Hadash congregation. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Representatives for organizations including the Anti-Defamation League, Dorcas International and the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence were on hand to offer resources inviting vigil participants to become involved and offer support.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We really wanted to make sure that we were able to offer opportunities to the community … to prepare to take action,” Jewish Alliance CEO Adam Greenman said. “Coming together to pray was important, but coming together to act was equally important.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Some disagreed that the vigil should be accompanied by political calls to action. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Is this a political rally?” screamed Alan Gordon, jumping onto stage during Rev. Anderson’s speech. “I’m a Jew and I am offended by this politicization of our time of mourning.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But many politicians present — including Gov. Gina Raimondo and State Senator Joshua Miller (D-28) — emphasized the fact that future tragedies like the Tree of Life shooting could be prevented through gun control reform. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You can’t take the politics of gun control out of an incident where an automatic weapon was used as part of the incident,” Miller told The Herald. “They’re inevitably tied — you cannot untie that. So, if there’s something more to be done to make communities that don’t feel safe feel safer, that’s part of what we do on behalf of the victims of violence.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We should all be able to agree there are too many guns in society,” Raimondo told The Herald, “and you shouldn’t have to be afraid of going to school or church or synagogue, and we need some better common sense gun safety.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Linda Finn, President of the R.I. Coalition Against Gun Violence, stressed that her organization and policymakers like Sen. Miller have pushed for gun control laws for the past five years. But laws such as bans on the AR-15 assault rifle and high-capacity magazines, along with a “Safe Schools Act” preventing concealed carry permits in schools, have all fallen through in the State House. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It is a politicized issue in that it’s politicians that make laws that can affect outcomes,” Finn said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the candles dimmed, those gathered at the vigil expressed the spirit of resilience and change through one last song.</span></p>

&nbsp;
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We may never see this moment or place and time again,” the crowd sang at the vigil’s conclusion. “It will take a change of heart for this to mend. If not now, tell me when.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Nationally, climate change is a partisan issue with clearly assigned camps. The Democratic National Committee addresses climate change 24 times in its 2016 platform, while the Republican National Committee makes only three mentions. But in Rhode Island, gubernatorial candidates are defying partisan expectations in reference to one contentious piece of fossil fuel infrastructure: the proposed natural gas-burning power plant in Burrillville.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Republican candidate Allan Fung<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>opposes the power plant, while Democrat Gov. Gina Raimondo lauded the plant upon its plan for construction in 2015, though her rhetoric has become more neutral in recent months. Independent Joe Trillo has also spoken out against the plant.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For some Democrats in Burrillville, Raimondo’s wavering stance is causing them to think twice about the party they will support in the upcoming gubernatorial election. Since 2015, the town of Burrillville and the Conservation Law Foundation have vehemently fought against the plant’s ability to get a building permit from the Energy Facility Siting Board, which has yet to make the decision and continues to hold hearings on potential construction. The initial 2015 press release by Invenergy, the company building the plant, stated that construction would begin in 2016, but no ground has been broken.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s a land issue, it’s an open space, clean water, clean air issue,” said Paul Roselli, president of the Burrillville Land Trust. “With climate change being more and more prevalent, each and every one of us has to oppose anything to do with fossil fuels.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Roselli ran as a Democratic candidate for the Senate seat representing the 23rd district of Rhode Island in this year’s primary and strongly backed Democrat Matt Brown in the gubernatorial primary. This presents Roselli with a quandary when he enters the ballot box on Nov. 6: Should he vote for his party’s representative if she hasn’t taken the same strides as her Republican opponent to block the plant?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“To be bluntly honest, I don’t know (who I’m voting for),” Roselli said, adding that he is not enthusiastic about any candidate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Environmental Studies and Sociology Timmons Roberts has already pledged his support for Raimondo, but he believes the power plant puts liberal voters in an “uncomfortable position.” Roberts testified to the EFSB in 2016 and 2018 that the power plant would make it impossible for the state to achieve its carbon emission reduction goals.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo could not be reached for comment, but in recent months, she has backed off from her previous support of the power plant and emphasized the autonomy of the EFSB in its decision to grant the power plant a permit.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m not going to ram the decision through. I trust the process and respect the outcome that they come up with,” Raimondo said in a general election debate hosted by ecoRI News. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Throughout her time as governor, Raimondo has prioritized environmental issues, rolling out a plan to increase renewable energy production by 100 percent by the end of 2020. She has emphasized that the EFSB should take into account the recent growth of renewables, like offshore wind, when considering the need for the new plant.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Despite the EFSB being an independent “quasi-judicial body that should be ruling like a judge rules,” Burrillville residents have expressed concern that the process is political, said Jerry Elmer, senior attorney for CLF. Many worry that two of the three EFSB board members, who “sit at the pleasure of the governor,” feel implicit encouragement to allow a permit because of Raimondo’s history of support for the plant, Elmer added. Donna Woods, a Burrillville resident, voted in 2014 for Raimondo, who she saw as “a woman and a Democrat (I) thought was supporting my own beliefs.” But Raimondo’s unwillingness to oppose the power plant drove Woods to look elsewhere for the 2018 election. Since the primaries, Woods has been organizing “town hall forums” for prospective politicians to pitch their platforms to Burrillville residents. She hosted Fung Oct. 25.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Woods does not conduct official polls, but she sees residents’ interactions with the various contenders and receives feedback on candidates. Though Burrillville residents feared Fung would be aligned with President Trump’s environmental policies, they found he would diverge from some of the traditional Republican policies, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung advocated for communities to have “local control” over infrastructure projects like the power plant. Woods has now made up her mind to vote for Fung — and, according to her, she’s not alone.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are painfully aware that the governor says one thing but does another on the environment, but we have been afraid of the national implications of voting for Fung,” Woods said. Yet, “more people than not are saying that they will lean toward voting for Fung now” after his town hall forum, Woods said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown students involved in Rhode Island Sunrise, a chapter of a national youth movement to stop climate change, have shown up to multiple EFSB hearings and rallies in opposition of the power plant, said Lauren Maunus ’19, a member of the group. Maunus saw a connection between Raimondo’s stance on the power plant and the money she has received from fossil fuel companies, including a $250,000 August donation from oil and gas company Samson Energy Company. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But for Maunus, Fung’s opposition to the power plant isn’t sufficient to earn a vote.“I never will approach fossil fuel money or climate change as a single issue, and I think it’s very dangerous to put that before other human rights and social justice and civil rights issues,” Maunus said. “I would not say that just because Fung is opposed to the power plant, he should have any more attraction or any more support for candidacy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Roberts agreed with Maunus. While Fung and Trillo may oppose the power plant, he predicts their actions on climate change issues would be insufficient or even stifling to the plans already in place.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The two other candidates are just totally unacceptable,” he said. “On climate and many, many other things. They have not expressed any leadership or concern (on) the issue of climate change and would be at the head of dismantling what state agencies we have to deal with issues like climate change.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even after three years of hearings on the power plant, Burrillville residents will continue to wait on a decision from the EFSB into the new year. More hearings are scheduled throughout January, Elmer said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Andrew Augustus resigned as a spokesperson for Mayor of Cranston Allan Fung’s gubernatorial campaign after misogynistic and racist tweets from his time at Rhode Island College were discovered this week.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Upon hire, an inspection of (Augustus’s) social media account was conducted, but obviously not six or seven years back,” wrote Fung Campaign Manager Andrew Vargas Vila in an email to The Herald. “While Andrew is a different person now, and is extremely embarrassed by this, he does not want to reflect poorly on the Mayor or distract from any part of this campaign.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One tweet from Jan. 2, 2012, read, “Lucky to be where I am in life, I have the balls to say what others are thinking(.) I am going to get a tattoo on my chest saying No Fat Chicks.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Another tweet posted 11 days later read, “Black people + ice skates = hilarity.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Other tweets included language of a sexual nature, making fun of women, black people and politicians.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Huffington Post originally <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/allan-fung-rhode-island-press-secretary-tweets_us_5bd88883e4b0dee6eecea3c0?ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067">reported</a> on the tweets and Augustus’ resignation Tuesday after they were discovered by digital strategist and Cranston native Lindsay Crudele. Screenshots of the deleted tweets were posted by Crudele to Twitter and are included in the Huffington Post article. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“What does South Carolina have in common with #NewtGingrich? They both like being full of whores,” he wrote that same January 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The tweets were written during Augustus’ time at RIC from 2008 to 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before working on Fung’s campaign, Augustus was a press associate at Providence City Hall under Mayor Jorge Elorza. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Crudele found the tweets after seeing that one of her followers criticized Augustus for a misogynistic tweet. When she tried to see the mentioned tweet, she discovered that it was already deleted and resorted to a Boolean search to find it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">She found the original tweet and others like it. “It’s just how he tweeted, all the time, for a couple of years spread. Not a fluke, but a trend,” Crudele wrote in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Crudele has been keeping up with the race because her parents still live in Cranston, she wrote. Crudele’s mother, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, called Augustus and asked about Fung’s position on health care to provide information to an MS support group but never received an answer. Still needing an answer, Crudele tweeted at Fung asking about his position on healthcare and was then blocked by him. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“You can imagine how it feels for me to realize that I have been posing serious policy questions to a team whose spokesperson publicly joked about ‘No Fat Chicks,’ and made other dehumanizing remarks,” Crudele wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Joseph Trillo, independent candidate for governor, took to Twitter to criticize Fung for Augustus’ hire. “Allan tried to sweep this under the rug. THIS is the type of people working on his campaign,” Trillo posted to Twitter with a link to the Huffington Post article.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“BAD leaders hire BAD staff,” he wrote in another tweet Tuesday night.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By press time, The Herald was unable to confirm Augustus’ replacement.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Last week, Cranston Mayor and Republican candidate for Governor of Rhode Island Allan Fung released a television advertisement attacking incumbent Gov. Gina Raimondo for mismanaging the United Health Infrastructure Program, a Department of Human Services and Executive Office of Health and Human Services initiative.</p>
<p class="p4">An integrative online portal that combined 15 programs was launched in September 2016 as the UHIP program expanded to distribute health care, food stamps and benefits to over 300,000 eligible citizens. UHIP, created in 2011, had successfully implemented a health exchange program to a more limited base in the first phase of its implementation.</p>
<p class="p4">The online portal suffered significant technical failures, which meant that some benefit recipients were unable to access the web page. Eligibility was incorrectly evaluated under the new guidelines, benefits were delivered late and thousands of applications were not processed at all.</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo endorsed the integration of welfare services through a single platform at the time, but Fung has taken issue with the program’s flawed implementation and ballooning costs.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>History of the program</b></p>
<p class="p4">Then-Governor Lincoln Chafee ’75 P’14 began UHIP to integrate social programs, save the state money and save benefit recipients time and effort.</p>
<p class="p4">In 2012, the Affordable Care Act incentivized states to overhaul their benefit systems by requiring “updates to technology and an integrated eligibility system for federal funding,” wrote Department of Health and Human Services Chief Public Affairs Officer Alisha Pina in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">Federal funding would “cover up to 90 percent of digital infrastructure costs,” according to a 2015 EOHHS press release. Rhode Island was among several states to seize this opportunity to modernize, and the state began replacing its 30-year-old collection of computer systems, Pina wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s about government efficiency; it’s about customer service and ease; and it’s about continuity of coverage. If it functions right, it has a lot of benefits,” said Anya Wallack, professor of the practice of health services, policy and practice. Wallack, a former UHIP steering committee member, also formerly served as HealthSource RI chief and Medicaid director for Raimondo’s administration.</p>
<p class="p4">“The idea was to have a unified system,” Wallack said. She applauded the idea but cautioned that “there’s a fair amount of risk involved” in any revamp of that scale, especially one that is<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>time-sensitive and heavily reliant on a single vendor.</p>
<p class="p4">Chafee signed a state contract with private contractor and consulting firm Deloitte to build the online system.</p>
<p class="p4">It is standard for states to hire external experts for projects that require specific technical knowledge. The government often lacks the resources to “properly staff and oversee these projects because they’re often so strapped and so sensitive to the taxpayer burden,” Wallack said.</p>
<p class="p4">“States don’t pay like high-tech firms do, so attracting and retaining the kind of talent that you need to oversee enormous information technology projects is just a real challenge for state governments,” she said. This issue is “not in any way unique to Rhode Island,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">The state divided UHIP’s implementation into two phases. During the first phase, which the state launched in 2015, Rhode Island set up a health insurance coverage exchange by creating a portal intended only to process “simple Medicaid” requests, making the care available to people below a certain income level.</p>
<p class="p4">UHIP outperformed equivalents in other states, including Vermont, in timeliness and accessibility at this stage, Wallack said.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>UHIP’s roadblocks in Phase II</b></p>
<p class="p4">Phase II was launched in autumn 2016, two years after Raimondo’s election. This second stage was much more “complex,” since it served as a joint platform for other benefits and increased the number of people it served. Unlike “simple Medicaid,” which requires only a certain income level to establish eligibility, Phase II’s Medicaid component covered a wider base.</p>
<p class="p4">Federal overseers warned Rhode Island to wait before it rolled out Phase II, but Deloitte and the state deemed the program ready for expansion.</p>
<p class="p4">The Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has co-sponsored two lawsuits against UHIP. The ACLU filed the first with the National Center for Law and Economic Justice in December 2016 because applications to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were not being processed in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="p4">The ACLU will continue to monitor the state until it demonstrates that it has processed 96 percent of applications on time over the course of 11 to 12 months, The Herald previously reported.</p>
<p class="p4">“They have yet to make it to 96 percent on either (expedited or non-expedited application rate processing), a whole year beyond where they are supposed to be. So we have been very actively involved,” said Lynette Labinger, an attorney for the ACLU. “They’re still processing around 4,000 applications a month.”</p>
The state and Deloitte have implemented significant technical improvements to the system, Pina wrote.
<p class="p4">The second lawsuit was filed in January 2018 on behalf of customers whose health insurance access was blocked by a computer glitch, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/09/committee-oversight-reviews-lawsuits-insurance-food-stamps/">previously reported</a>.</p>
<p class="p4">Besides experiencing technical failures, the program has also exceeded its budget. Originally intended to save the state “<a href="http://www.eohhs.ri.gov/Portals/0/Uploads/Documents/FederalFundingForComprehensiveEligibilityPortal.pdf">over $90 million a year</a>,” the current total projected cost of UHIP is $647.7 million, according to <a href="https://www.wpri.com/target-12/uhip-system-s-projected-cost-jumps-to-647-million/1342179692">WPRI</a>. The program is expected to be completed in 2020.</p>
<p class="p6"><b> Program progress</b></p>
<p class="p4">According to the most recent EOHHS Oversight report, dated Oct. 19, the number of reported issues with the online system has dropped from 7,649 in December 2017 to 2,217 as of Sept. 29 this year, which is “a 71 percent decrease.”</p>
<p class="p4">At least 90 percent of SNAP applications have been processed on time over the past six months, Pina noted, compared to 56.5 percent in November 2017. Timeliness for all programs stands at 77 percent, she added, compared to 66 percent nearly a year ago.</p>
<p class="p4">“Rhode Island has one of the lowest uninsured rates in the country at 4.3 percent. The state is third in the nation for children’s health coverage, with 98 percent of children covered,” she wrote, crediting UHIP and its online portal as “an important factor.”</p>
<p class="p4">But the difference between a 90 percent timely processing rate and a 96 percent rate is “still a significant number of households,” said Greg Bass, senior attorney for the National Center for Law and Economic Justice.</p>
<p class="p4">“Our top priority has always been ensuring people have access to benefits,” Pina wrote. While the platform has “largely stabilized and is not affecting access for the majority of customers, we remain focused on ensuring all Rhode Islanders have timely access and on bringing the system into compliance with all federal rules and regulations.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Program oversight</b></p>
<p class="p4">Many individuals employed by the state and Deloitte share responsibility for UHIP, Wallack said. “Deloitte is actually building the system, but state people are involved to try to make sure that they’re adhering to the state specifications and building the system so that it works,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“Every governor ultimately bears responsibility for what’s going on within their government when they’re the boss,” Wallack said. Even so, “any governor that undertook this worthy project would find it difficult because it’s a difficult project,” she added. “The project was laudable – many parts of it went well, and I think every state that got into this space faced challenges to a greater or lesser degree.”</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo has apologized repeatedly for UHIP’s unanticipated failures. “Mistakes were made, which I own,” she acknowledged in the first gubernatorial debate, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/27/gubernatorial-candidates-face-off-debate/">previously reported</a>.</p>
<p class="p4">In comparison to the rest of the country, “the scope (of UHIP) is broader than most states, … and the success is probably about average,” Wallack said. Other states either did not implement programs that were as ambitious as Phase II or also experienced significant technical issues,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Deloitte has partnered with other states including Georgia, according to Bass.</p>
<p class="p4">Outcomes have varied, Wallack said. “Some Deloitte states went disastrously, and some Deloitte states went really well. … It’s hard to blame it on any particular vendor in different circumstances,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Raimondo “continues to hold Deloitte accountable to delivering the system we asked for,” Pina wrote. “We are in a much better place today than we were at go live. This past year, for instance, we had the largest year-over-year growth of insured Rhode Islanders through the state’s health exchange.”</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Looking toward election day</b></p>
<p class="p4">“The governor should be directly involved in contractual negotiations related to high costs and high risks projects, which have a direct impact on the lives of thousands of Rhode Islanders,” wrote independent candidate for governor Luis-Daniel Muñoz in an email to The Herald. “The governor also has a role in establishing leadership and structuring initiatives within EOHHS. The governor also sets forth expectations around project management and project outcomes.”</p>
<p class="p4">More transparency and piloting of the program were called for, Muñoz added. Nevertheless, he supports the idea of an integrated system for benefits, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">“Whenever comparing technology solutions, it is important to measure success on the basis of whether we’ve improved the lives of those using the solution, and based on the challenges resulting from the UHIP system, I think that we still have a lot of work to do,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">“I believe in small, local implementation of community self-help, and my ReGenerative Funding plan will eliminate the need for centralized software of service providers which are too big and too easy to corrupt,” wrote Compassion Party gubernatorial candidate Anne Armstrong in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">Candidates Raimondo, Fung, William Gilbert and Joe Trillo did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<em><strong>Correction: A portion of a quote attributed to Lynette Labinger about technical improvements to UHIP has been removed over concern that it was misleading. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>In race for City Hall, school funding takes center stage</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The final week in the race for Providence mayor has highlighted key differences between the candidates in their stances on the Providence school system and potential funding solutions. Incumbent Democratic candidate Jorge Elorza, who bested his two primary challengers in early September, will face two Independent candidates, Dianne “Dee Dee” Witman and Jeffrey Lemire, in the Nov. 6 general election.</p>
<p class="p4">Elorza ran his first successful mayoral campaign in 2014, beating former Providence mayor Vincent “Buddy” Cianci Jr. and Republican Daniel Harrop, according to the Rhode Island Board of Elections. Witman, who has never run for public office before, previously sat on the city commission for the Providence Public Building Authority and was a political fundraiser, according to her campaign website. Lemire, who has lived in Providence for the past eight years, works in construction and has not previously run for public office.</p>
<p class="p4">With less than a week to go before the general election, the candidates have raised over $1 million in total. Only Elorza and Witman have reported raising funds to the elections board. Witman’s campaign coffers sit at $439,000, about $200,000 behind Elorza’s. Witman is the first to present a serious fundraising challenge to Elorza, who out-raised his primary challengers by large amounts, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/16/mayor-elorzas-campaign-funds-exceed-competitors-half-million/">previously reported</a>.</p>
<p class="p4">In total, there have been three debates for the mayor’s race, covering a host of issues. Front and center of these debates has been the Providence public school system. The three candidates have presented vastly different visions for Providence’s future. Providence schools face major infrastructure issues, school teachers have been without a contract since August 2017 and the bus drivers union recently ended an 11-day strike, according to WPRI.</p>
<p class="p4">Teachers union contract issues have still not been settled. Elorza expressed his frustration with the negotiation tactics the teachers union has used, such as the union’s decision to have all members under <a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/providence/providence-teachers-will-start-school-year-in-work-to-rule/1407366107">work-to-rule status</a>, where employees only perform the basic duties required by their employer. “I think it’s a position they’ve taken intentionally because it hurts children,” Elorza said during the Oct. 9 debate.</p>
<p class="p4">In an interview with The Herald, Witman stressed the importance of sitting down and talking with the teachers unions and other civil servant unions in the city. “They are your civil workers, they’re on the front line,” she said. “How do you dare … not talk with them? You can be sure I would.”</p>
<p class="p4">Witman also pointed to Elorza’s handling of the firefighters union as another strike against his ability to work with unions. “He was really caught with his pants down on that one. That was failed leadership,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Lemire voiced his admiration for the teachers of Providence. It’s “the toughest job in the city,” he told The Herald. Lemire said he did not have a solution to settle a contract with the teachers union. “I have no idea what these teachers want. We don’t know!”</p>
<p class="p4">Providence schools also face financial troubles. Elorza recently wrote a letter to Providence citizens stating that the School Department will face a $37 million deficit over the next five years because of federal funding cuts and other decreases in funding, according to the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20181026/providence-mayor-jorge-elorza-city-schools-facing-37m-deficit-in-next-5-years">Providence Journal</a>. “That means really dramatic cuts that we’re going to have to make in our School Department over the coming years,” he said in the Oct. 9 debate.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Witman echoed that sentiment. “We have a population that has more needs than any other city in Rhode Island … in terms of funding,” she said. She added that solving this issue would require undoing some of the decisions made by the Elorza administration, and the city would have “to do more with less.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">An independent report commissioned by the School Building Authority at the Rhode Island Department of Education estimated $627 million was necessary to bring R.I. schools up to the standard of “warm, safe and dry.” The report said it would take a further $1.59 billion to bring the schools to the highest standards outlined in the assessment.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Elorza has suggested leasing the city’s Water Supply Board, which was valued at $404.2 million in 2017, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/04/elorza-reiterates-call-lease-providence-water-supply-board/">previously reported</a>. The money would be used to help ease the financial troubles facing schools and help pay for the city’s pension liabilities, which have exceeded $1 billion. “Unless we do something, the city’s going to die a slow … and painful death, so something has to be done,” he said in the Oct. 9 debate. The National Resource Network, which advises cities on how to address economic issues, suggested that Providence sell or lease city assets to cure its budget woes.</p>
<p class="p4">Leasing the Water Supply Board would be authorized through the Municipal Water Supply Systems Transactions Act, which would allow the board to <a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/dan-mcgowan/mayor-elorza-again-seeks-to-monetize-providences-water-supply/1140886374">contract with other public and private entities</a> without oversight from the R.I. Public Utilities Commission.</p>
<p class="p4">“We believe that monetization of our water system is a viable and sustainable solution,” wrote Victor Morente, press secretary for the office of the mayor, in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">Witman agrees that the city should be allowed to profit off of the Water Supply Board, but selling the board outright is “not going to happen” if she were to be elected, she said. Witman said she and her campaign were thinking of inventive ways to address the issue, but that she was “not at liberty” to explain them. “We sell our water to other cities,” she said. “We sell it, but we’re not allowed to make a profit on it.”</p>
<p class="p4">Lemire, however, was staunchly opposed to monetizing the Water Supply Board. “We can’t sell it,” he said. “If I’m elected mayor, everybody that’s in the Providence Water Department on the Board of Directors is fired.”</p>
<p class="p4">Another potential solution for Providence schools’ funding disparities lies in Rhode Island referendum question one and local Providence referendum question four. Question one would allow the state to issue a quarter of a billion dollars in bonds to fuel school infrastructure spending across the state. Question four would allow the city of Providence to issue up to $160 million in bonds for school improvements for fiscal years 2019-24.</p>
<p class="p4">Witman was reluctant to support the passage of question one. “I hope a lot of money goes to Providence, (but) I’m not sure it will,” she said. She stressed the importance of supporting schools statewide. Despite her reservations about question one, she supports referendum question four. “We certainly need to do (it) for city schools.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Lemire was not in favor of the local Providence referendum. “We don’t need to borrow any money,” he said. Lemire added that he worries the money would leave the state through contract hiring outside the city of Providence or even the state. “The money’s going to go so fast you aren’t even going to realize it,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Elorza could not be reached for comment on this particular issue.</p>
<p class="p4">Megan Geoghegan, communications director for RIDE, recognized the impact that improving school building quality would have on school culture and student performance. After “a complete and accurate evaluation of the state of our school buildings, … we believe this once-in-a-generation investment is necessary for our students,” she wrote in an email to The Herald. Geoghegan said that RIDE played a supporting role in drafting the language used in question one.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">When Alyssa Cohen enrolled in Providence College she expected a conservative campus because of its Catholic affiliation. But she said she was not anticipating the difficulties that accompanied her liberal views.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s hard sometimes,” said Cohen, who is now a sophomore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“People can be very judgmental in knowing that you’re liberal. I have a pin on my backpack that says ‘Betsy DeVos Can’t Read’ and I get dirty looks all the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cohen’s story is just one of many from students across the Ocean State, who, regardless of their political persuasion, are navigating the biases, assumptions and partisanship that come with trying to voice an opinion on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">PC students are increasingly interested in politics, according to President of PC Republicans Jeff McCormac. “This year we have almost 500 people registered for the (Republicans) club,” he said, adding that he hopes to bring more conservative speakers to campus. Earlier this month, Republican gubernatorial candidate Allan Fung visited PC’s campus. The group also organizes a trip to the Conservative Political Action Conference every year. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Adjunct Lecturer in International and Public Affairs Bob Hackey, who serves as the chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at PC, said he has seen “limited involvement” on PC’s campus in terms of political activism. Many students, instead, are involved with public service through the Office of the Chaplain, which partners with nonprofits and schools throughout the state, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve seen an increase in student activism over the past few years, but for a lot of college students, activism takes a back seat with midterms, papers and projects to complete,” Hackey said. “Brown students are atypical in that they take a larger interest in student activism.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hackey mentioned that there is a large pro-life contingency on PC’s campus, with the Office of the Chaplain sponsoring student busses to the March for Life in Washington D.C. each January.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though they are in the minority, PC Democrats have organized protests in light of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings, in addition to marches against racial bias in campus security incidents. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There was a march on campus for survivors of sexual assault, and in the past there has been a lot of protesting and student activism surrounding race relations on campus,” said Caleigh Rockwal, a senior at PC. “We’ve had several instances over the past four years of racial bias, especially when it comes to our campus security, so that’s been an ongoing presence of activism on campus.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to national events, controversies on campus over the past year have drummed up political participation and interest, McCormac said. Last fall during Halloween, a group on campus invited “stressed” students to stab a “Trumpkin,” a pumpkin with President Trump’s face drawn on it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Micol Striuli, a member of PC’s College Democrats, said that liberal students on campus feel frustrated with the political climate.“I don’t think the majority of the students realize how much recent events will affect them or other people,” she said. “It’s kind of hard to accomplish anything. It’s kind of demoralizing. People are either not willing to learn or not willing to take part.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Savannah Plaisted, a sophomore at PC, said she has seen a discrepancy in funding between the College Republicans and Democrats. According to PC Student Congress documents for the 2018-19 school year, Student Congress awarded the College Democrats $450 last year and the College Republicans $2,265. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“That’s coming from the administration and the Student Congress itself,” Plaisted said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the Providence College Republicans are the dominant political voice on campus, they said they want to work with the Democrats to promote constructive conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are looking to do something with them,” McCormac said. “We think that might be very constructive. Any kind of constructive dialogue is always good for both sides.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While students are active along party lines, some also are organizing around voter turnout. Rockwal has been involved with voter registration efforts on campus, working with PC’s Office of Citizenship and Off-Campus Life to run an event on National Voter Registration Day, Sept. 25. She has also worked with TurboVote to register students to vote. Over 80 students were signed up via TurboVote, according to Katrina Alicea, an administrative coordinator with PC’s Office of Residential Life.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the University of Rhode Island, College Democrats and Republicans have worked together on a variety of initiatives ­— from lobbying for funding from URI to voter registration drives, among other initiatives, said Ed Tarnowski, president of the URI College Republicans.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We had a bipartisan voter drive this past week,” Tarnowski said. “We’re also working with Bridge USA and the College Democrats to get funding for political groups.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The URI College Republicans have brought in speakers through the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a national organization that advocates for free speech on college campuses. The speakers have touched on how the URI student handbook infringes on student rights and have advocated against the lack of funding from the URI administration for political groups.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tarnowski said that the College Republicans pride themselves on the level of civil discourse and constructive conversation they have with other groups on campus, adding that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the College Democrats and Republicans held a bipartisan Super Bowl party last January.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the Rhode Island School of Design, President of the Student Alliance Sophie Chien said that while students are increasingly interested in politics, there has not been an equal increase in student activism.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think there’s a rise in people talking about (politics). I’m not convinced yet that there’s a rise in people doing stuff about it,” Chien said. “We talk a lot about politics on this campus, but it’s hard for people to vote here because I’d say maybe two percent of our student body is from Rhode Island.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chien ran voter registration drives before the midterm elections in affiliation with the Global Initiative and the Student Alliance. She emphasized the importance of facilitating absentee request forms and voter registration given the make-up of the student body. RISD is 33 percent international students, so engaging students politically can be difficult when the U.S. government is not their primary representative, Chien said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chein is unsure who<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will continue her voter registration efforts after she leaves RISD next year. “It’s really just me,” she said. “It’s a one man show. I don’t know what will happen when I’m gone.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Across campuses in the Ocean State, students expressed a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>desire for better political discourse between groups with different political ideologies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I would like to see my campus become more politically aware and engaged and … (have) more respect (for different) … genders, political persuasions and races,” Cohen said. “Something that gets lost in the thick of it is empathy.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">On Nov. 6, incumbent Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., will face off against Republican and former Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Robert Flanders ’71 in the Rhode Island Senate midterm elections. Rhode Islanders strongly favor Whitehouse, according to a recent WPRI poll that had Whitehouse 19 points ahead of Flanders.</p>
<p class="p4">The candidates differ on many key issues including climate change, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation and approval of President Trump and his administration. Whitehouse is known as a “climate champion,” according to the Rhode Island chapter of the Sunrise Movement, an environmental activism group, but Flanders calls him a “global alarmist.”</p>
<p class="p4">Over the course of his 12 years in office, Whitehouse has made climate change a top priority, taking to the Senate floor every week to discuss global warming, according to a Mashable article published in March 2018. He authored the American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act, which would instate a national carbon fee wh<span class="s5">ose proceeds would go back to U.S. citizens. Whitehouse introduced a second version of the act to the Senate in February 2018 and it was referred to the Committee on </span><span class="s6">Finance. Since then, a carbon tax has received bipartisan support. Following this proposal, “prominent Republicans who are serious about solving the challenge of climate change have endorsed a revenue-neutral carbon fee like the one I’ve proposed,” Whitehouse wrote in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s6">But not all environm</span><span class="s5">ental activists believe that Whitehouse is doing enough to address climate change. He is still “set in this establishment mindset,” said Sunrise R.I.’s Hub Coordinator Lauren Maunus ’19, adding that she wishes he would publicly oppose natural gas projects and refuse funding from fossil fuel companies. The group has criticized Whitehouse for refusing to sign the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge, which asks signatories to commit to adopting “a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, executives or front groups” of oil, gas or coal companies, the pledge states. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.T., New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and candidates for Rhode Island State Senate Melissa Murray and Bridget Valverde, among others, have signed the pledge.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">In April 2018, Whitehouse voted against confirming vocal climate change denier Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, though initially he refused to publicly oppose Pompeo's nomination. Pompeo has also accepted numerous campaign donations from the Koch brothers, Maunus said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">In contrast to Whitehouse, Flanders prefers that private businesses, as opposed to government actors, address climate change. “I have great faith in our private enterprise and I’d rather let them do their best,” Flanders told The Herald. He criticized Whitehouse’s prioritization of the issue, and while he admitted that it is important to “work around potential effects of climate change,” the United States will still need to “depend on fossil fuels for the foreseeable future,” Flanders said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">The candidates are also at odds when it comes to Kavanaugh, as Flanders sharply criticized Whitehouse’s contributions to Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing for being too partisan. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Whitehouse decided to vote against confirming Kavanaugh after the first Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/06/whitehouse-kavanaugh-sexual-assault-claims/">previously reported</a>. “The biggest factor for me is the array of indicators that he would be a highly partisan Supreme Court judge,” Whitehouse said in a previous interview with The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">During the hearing, Whitehouse called attention to Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook, reading out loud snippets from Kavanaugh’s personal page referencing beer and “flatulence.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">“I thought his performance was abysmal,” Flanders said, adding that Whitehouse’s use of Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook writings was an “exercise in character assassination and personal attack.” In the end, while Whitehouse voted against Kavanaugh’s confirmation, Flanders remains in support of the judge. Flanders said that the allegations against Kavanaugh from Christine Blasey Ford “were completely unsubstantiated and not corroborated by even the people that the accuser said were there.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Neither candidate is a big supporter of Trump, but while Whitehouse ardently opposes the president on most key issues, Flanders is more closely aligned with some of the administration’s policies. In an email to The Herald, Whitehouse pledged to protect “our shared American values from President Trump’s attacks” and wrote that “the battles ahead are going to have enormous consequences for the generation that’s just coming of age” with Trump as president.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Flanders said he would not hesitate to oppose Trump,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but “when he does things that are good for the country and Rhode Island I’ll support him.” Flanders criticized Trump’s choice to separate families at the U.S.-Mexico border, his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his “across the board tariff raises,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But on issues such as immigration and gun control, Flanders is more aligned with the Trump administration. He warned against the “caravan of thousands of Central Americans trying to storm our borders” and generally emphasizes border security as a key priority. Flanders favors “beefing up security” rather than imposing a ban on </span><span class="s6">assault weapons and is not in favor of doing anything “that would potentially be in violation of the Second Amendment,” he said. Flanders believes that rather than looking to Congress to pass legislation, the c</span><span class="s5">ountry should improve security in places like schools and other communal areas, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s5">Since March 2017, Whitehouse’s campign has raised $4.7 million compared to the Flanders campaign’s $881</span>,000, according to Federal Election Commission data. Flanders’ donors are made up of mostly private individuals, while Whitehouse has received funds from technology companies, labor unions, military contractors and energy companies, including National Grid.</p>
<em><strong><span class="s5">Correction: A previous version of this article stated that in April 2018, Whitehouse voted to confirm vocal climate change denier Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State. In fact, Whitehouse initially refused to publicly oppose Pompeo but did eventually vote against confirming him. The Herald regrets the error. </span></strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">In the final televised gubernatorial debate before voters head to the polls, the four candidates clashed over whether incumbent Democrat Gov. Gina Raimondo deserved credit for improving Rhode Island’s economy and prompted heated discussions about education, school safety and the Department of Human Services’ and Executive Office of Health and Human Services’ controversial public benefits registration system.</p>
<p class="p4">WJAR news anchor Gene Valicenti<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>moderated the debate at Rhode Island College, featuring GOP nominee and Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, independent Joe Trillo and Moderate Party nominee Bill Gilbert, along wit<span class="s3">h Raimondo. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When I started as governor (in 2015) we had the highest unemployment rate in the country,” Raimondo said. “We were struggling, … and I put in place a strategy to make it easier and cheaper to do business.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung and Trillo would dismantle her administration’s signature tax credit programs — such as Rebuild Rhode Island — that have encouraged investment in the Ocean State and created thousands of well-paying jobs, Raimondo said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Stop with the fairy tales about the economy,” Fung said in response. “This corporate welfare culture is going to stop. The governor should be fired, period.” Raimondo’s tax credits should be scrapped and repurposed as “sales tax cuts” and a “low-fee guarantee” to lower licensing and administrative fees for local businesses, Fung added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a discussion about education, Raimondo championed her administration’s investments in the state’s public school infrastructure and curriculum. “Rhode Island is one of the only states in the country where we teach computer science in every grade starting in kindergarten,” she said. “And Cranston had pretty much no pre-K programs until I became governor and brought it about.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung criticized Raimondo for having public universities raise tuition under her tenure, adding that he would end free tuition for students at the Community College of Rhode Island and instead offer them “tax credits” to pay off debt if they stayed in the state to work. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The other candidates offered their own proposals for education reform. Gilbert advocated for the creation of a large-scale vocational training program, while Trillo argued that teachers deserved more control in designing their own curricula. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Candidates also touched on the subject of gun violence in schools. In September, 15-year-old William Parsons was fatally shot outside Providence Career and Technical Academy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Raimondo urged that the state ban guns on campuses, but the other candidates scoffed at this solution. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Just passing a law that says ‘Don’t bring a gun to school’ isn’t going to help anything,” Gilbert said. “We can live with the Second Amendment and not expect people to get shot.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Trillo declared that school buildings should be made more secure, and Fung advocated for funds to let schools decide how to improve their safety — whether through metal detectors, single point entry or bulletproof glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo also came under fire for Unified Health Infrastructure Project, the much-maligned public benefits computerized registration system rolled out under her administration by the Department of Human Services, which has cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars due to faulty programming.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve made mistakes, and I’ve learned from those mistakes,” Raimondo said. “But we’ve turned the corner.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both Trillo and Fung said they would fire Deloitte, the company responsible for developing the computer software for DHS’ UHIP. Raimondo failed to show effective leadership in fixing the situation, they added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Raimondo hit back by targeting Fung’s controversial involvement in a cover up for the Cranston police department in 2015, which was revealed in a 2015 <a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/state-police-release-assessment-of-cranston-police-department/1043844101">state police report</a>. “You cannot compare an IT glitch with public corruption,” Raimondo said, referencing a report in which an unnamed officer described Fung as running the department “like the mafia.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “That’s public corruption, and that’s the culture that’s held this state back for too long,” Raimondo said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung countered that Raimondo only “cares about … six-figure jobs for cronies” and denied the corruption charges as “hearsay.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Candidates were also divided on Rhode Island’s attitude toward undocumented immigrants. In June, Raimondo signed a bill that would allow participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in the state to procure driver’s licenses. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung said that undocumented immigrants should not be allowed to receive driver’s licenses. Local police should collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to deport undocumented immigrants, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Enabling undocumented immigrants to legally drive would encourage more “illegal migrants” to move to the state, Trillo said. But Fung’s recent public announcement that Cranston will not be a sanctuary state under his watch was merely symbolic, Trillo added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung “is politicizing public safety to scare people to get votes before election,” Raimondo said. “We follow the law, we follow the constitution. ICE knows every time someone gets finger printed.” Raimondo supports licenses for all undocumented immigrants, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In their final statements, the candidates streamlined their campaign messages for voters. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m asking you for a chance to continuing bringing change and finish the job we’ve started together,” Raimondo said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung promised to bring his ethos of hard work to the job, show strong le</span>adership and avoid wasting taxpayer dollars. Trillo touted his self-funded campaign and independence from lobbyists, while Gilbert emphasized his proposal to revamp the state’s tourism industry.</p>
<p class="p4">The election will be held Nov. 6.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Speaking on the steps of the Rhode Island State House Saturday morning, Payton James, a member of Rhode Island Pride, instructed hundreds of protesters to hold the hands of the people standing next to them. The group had gathered to demonstrate support for transgender rights amid recent news that the Trump administration is considering redefining gender as the “biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth,” the New York Times previously reported. Such a decision would limit the protections transgender people could receive under federal civil rights laws. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Coordinated by trans rights advocacy groups and allies from Rhode Island and surrounding areas, the rally featured speeches from several trans rights activists and allies as well as song and poetry performances. Organizers also invited attendees to speak on protecting trans rights. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The speeches delivered during the rally included a broad range of perspectives from community organizers, writers, artists and parents of trans youth. In addition to articulating the current fears of many transgender people, the speakers addressed other issues such as the importance of voting, the rise of violence toward other marginalized communities and the meaning of strong allyship. They also highlighted how trans people have displayed resilience. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While leading the crowd in a chant of “We will not be erased,” James said the rights of trans people, disabled people and people of color could not be taken away despite the challenging political climate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Queer and trans people have long been a community bound together by struggle and survival,” said Ethan Huckel, board president of the TGI Network of Rhode Island — a nonprofit dedicated to serving the transgender, gender-diverse and intersex community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though trans people experienced progress after events like the implementation of a statewide educational directive to support transgender students in Rhode Island, Huckel added that “the progress that we have realized is not etched in stone. It is vulnerable.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Referencing the Trump administration’s ongoing discussions to legally define sex under Title IX, Huckel said, “Conflating sex with gender is factually inaccurate.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Huckel also pointed out trans peoples’ history of having to advocate for their rights by making psychological, scientific and legal cases for their identity. “Our rights have not been handed to us, we have fought for them,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These discussions intend “to dismantle those rights by denying us of our humanity,” Huckel added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">TC Rogers, the chair of Options — a Rhode Island-based LGBTQ+ community magazine — spoke about the power of voting to secure long-term progress and safety for marginalized communities. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Nothing is more important than making sure the human rights of the most marginalized people of this nation are served,” Rogers said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “The consistent marginalization and dehumanization of people needs to end,” Rogers added, noting that placing trans advocates at the forefront of the trans rights movement would help center their narratives. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Alongside the speeches, several attendees sang and recited poetry. One activist, Justice Gaines ’16, recited a spoken word poem comparing President Trump’s abuses of power to the card game Spades. Pointing out a close resemblance between the administration’s politics and the lying, bluffing and power plays of the game, Gaines said, “When I think of Trump, I think of Spades … (and) how (the administration) would rely on chance instead of strategy, how they would react instead of plan.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wendy Grossman said she attended the event to “protest the hate being put forward.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Grossman referenced her Jewish identity and added that she saw a “connectedness in all of our fights for our human rights.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Community members met in front of Providence City Hall Saturday afternoon in protest of white supremacy and fascism following the Oct. 27 massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The rally, titled<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Never Again: An Antifascist Assembly for Jewish Lives,” focused primarily on the recent proliferation of anti-Semitism throughout the country and denounced racism, transphobia and xenophobia as interrelated forms of hate. In addition to giving speeches and chanting political messages, participants recited Shabbat prayers and sang to hark back to the Shabbat service of the Tree of Life, according to assembly organizer Norra Kaplan, who said she got “chills” when she learned that the words of the Torah were likely the last words that the victims heard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re living in an increasingly fascist state,” Kaplan told The Herald. “Instead of treating our problems as distinct or isolated, or trying to mourn in private, we should mourn in public … with anger and with compassion toward everyone who is also being victimized and targeted.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kaplan drew attention to the Kentucky grocery store murder of two black people Oct. 24, which — like the Pittsburgh shooting — was a recent instance of domestic white terrorism. While the rally was primarily focused on domestic fascism, a protester pointed to Brazil and Italy as evidence of the ideology’s growing global potency.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Kaplan opened the assembly by leading blessings. Replying with ‘amen,’ rally attendees sang “Hallelujah” together before Kaplan began to read from the Torah. Kaplan dedicated portions of the song to particular community members, such as the children of immigrants and trans people. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The names of the 11 people killed in the massacre were read from a sign displayed by the advocacy organization W.I.T.C.H. Boston. One placard read, “May Their Memories Be a Blessing.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Following the rally’s march around City Hall, organizers invited attendees to speak.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Assembly organizer Lex Rofeberg showed the crowd his copy of “The International Jew,” an anti-Semitic book published in 1920 that he said he holds as a reminder of the continued presence of anti-Semitism in society. He said that Jewish community members’ anger over the massacre has not been voiced as much as its mourning. “We’re not being victimized by some abstract emotion,” he said, explaining that he was not just fighting hate in general but “fighting white supremacy” specifically.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Protestors urged community members to mobilize in support of those who are being targeted by white supremacists. Alt-right groups should not be engaged in debate but, rather, must be denied a platform to disseminate hateful rhetoric, said activist Sara Bilman. Free speech is not hate speech, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bilman has been targeted by extremist groups and has received death threats for obstructing white supremacists and their recruiting efforts, she said. Her name has appeared in a fascist publication in triple parentheses — an anti-Semitic tactic used by the alt-right to denote that a person is Jewish, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“People in this country and increasingly (around) the world” are turning “to fascism in a desperate attempt to secure a false feeling of safety and superiority by scapegoating ‘the other,’” Bilman said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The assembly also reflected on the anti-Semitism experienced by Jewish people during World War II.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’ve just been seeing my Jewish family and community frightened and threatened,” rally attendee Katherine Bogen, whose grandfather was a Holocaust survivor, told The Herald. “I wanted to show solidarity,” she said, adding that her aunt attends the Tree of Life synagogue. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Protestor Shane Matheson spoke about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising during World War II — which marked the first organized revolt against Nazi-occupied Europe — and called for rally attendees to show this same sense of unity in response to neo-Nazis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rally attendee Remi Graber recalled the story of Jewish people in Lublin, Poland, who were ordered by the Nazis to sing before being executed; they sang, “Mir veln zey iberlebn (We will outlive them).” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We did outlive them and continue to do so,” Graber said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our next steps are (to try) to band together … (and) learn how to take care of each other,” Kaplan said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Rhode Islanders showed up and went blue Tuesday, with the highest midterm voter turnout in over a decade. Voters elected a Democratic majority across every statewide and federal office and approved a $250 million bond issue to rebuild schools.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Notable Election Day victors included incumbent Gov. Gina Raimondo, who retained her seat with over 50 percent of the vote in a six-way race. Her closest contender, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, trailed behind at 38 percent. The governor’s win is sizable in comparison to the 2014 race, when she secured 40.7 percent of the vote to narrowly edge out Fung’s 36.2 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“To all the little girls out there in Rhode Island, that’s the message to you,” Raimondo said in her acceptance speech. “You can be anything you want if you work hard.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fung congratulated Raimondo on a “hard-fought campaign” during his concession speech, commending her for “(driving) out that vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a remarkably close race, incumbent Rhode Island Speaker Nicholas Mattiello edged out Republican Steven Frias to keep his seat with only 141 votes separating the two before mail ballots were counted, according to the Rhode Island Board of Elections. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Representative David Cicilline ’83 (D-R.I.) kept their seats, as did Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza. Lieutenant Governor Daniel McKee and Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea also easily defended their titles. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Islanders also voted in favor of the state’s largest bond issue ever — $250 million for school repairs. Voters also approved bonds to remodel the University of Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay Campus and Rhode Island College’s Feinstein School of Education and Human Development. They also supported $47.3 million in bonds for environmental, water and recreational projects.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As of 8:30 p.m., 346,735 Rhode Islanders had voted in the election, according to RIBOE. Voting across the state appeared to go smoothly with the exception of Portsmouth High School’s polling location, which stayed open past the 8 p.m. closing time due to an electrical issue that moved voters to a gym in a different building. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Executive Director of RIBOE Robert Rapoza told The Herald that he is “very pleased with the way the election was conducted today.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A day after the midterm elections, the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs and the Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy co-hosted “The Impact of the Midterm Elections,” a panel featuring University professors from the political science department. The event, part of Watson’s Election Series, highlighted discussion surrounding the future of American democracy with younger voters and the implications of election results.</p>
<p class="p2">Wednesday’s panelists included Professor of Political Science Juliet Hooker, Director of the Master of Public Affairs Program and Professor of Political Science Eric Patashnik and Chair of Political Science Wendy Schiller. Susan Moffitt, director of the Taubman Center, moderated the panel.</p>
<p class="p2">“Your generation is a fairly immediate-gratification kind of group,” Schiller told the crowd, but “building infrastructure politically takes time.”</p>
<p class="p2">Schiller advised progressive voters to view these election results as a success rather than a disappointment. “Say to yourself, if you’re progressive, ‘This was a very strong move forward. We’ve captured an institutional control of government, and what can we do to build on this?’” she said.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hooker spoke about “racist rhetoric” that she said pervaded the campaign trail and received little repudiation.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“One of my main takeaways from last night is that racist rhetoric won,” Hooker said, mentioning the Tree of Life massacre in Pittsburgh and other violent hate crimes that she believes are inspired by this rhetoric.</p>
<p class="p2">“There’s a real issue here with the way in which the U.S. runs its elections,” Hooker said. “The discouragement of voting for partisan gain …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is really problematic for the health and the legitimacy of U.S. democracy.”</p>
<p class="p2">Patashnik discussed the bipartisan possibilities resulting from Tuesday’s election. Bipartisan dealmaking may occur in must-pass measures, such as those regarding the debt ceiling, but the Democrats’ main power lies in the ability to block G.O.P legislation and protect the Affordable Care Act, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">“What Americans want is a government that works,” Schiller said in response to Patashnik’s prior comment noting that the division of Congress would inhibit lawmaking.</p>
<p class="p2">Even in races where Democrats did not achieve a resounding victory, Schiller emphasized the Democratic Party’s “incremental progress” in securing nominations of candidates of color such as Florida’s Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum for governor and Georgia’s State Rep. Stacey Abrams for governor. Schiller said that the Democrats’ future rests on how they will build their infrastructure by recruiting more candidates of color in order to best combat the tone of the Trump administration.</p>
<p class="p2">“Now in Washington, there will be an institution that can rebut or confront the President,” Schiller said. “The Democrats will have a huge megaphone to combat these kinds of lies that the president tells from time to time and his use of rhetoric.”</p>
<p class="p2">Even with Democrats controlling the House, a Republican majority in the Senate and the marked polarization of the nation, Schiller recognizes the very gradual processes toward progress and tolerance.</p>
<p class="p2">“If you look at individual states, you can see a lot of social progress in terms of tolerance,” Schiller said. Tolerance is “a hallmark of the democracy,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">In addition to election results, panelists discussed the notably high voter turnout, with Patashnik remarking that the turnout reflects a high level of civic engagements on both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p class="p2">Hooker spent time considering the role of the media in the election, arguing that the industry has a responsibility to counter fearmongering tactics.Hooker acknowledged that the fear of being labeled as biased “makes it difficult for there to be independent reporting that can dilute some of the fearmongering,” but emphasized that “fearmongering gets amplified” when there is no effective counter.</p>
<p class="p2">The panel then opened up to questions from the audience, which included students and faculty.</p>
<p class="p2">One question focused on the future of transgender rights with an increasingly conservative court. In response, Schiller noted the power of social media. “It’s a new arena of contestation,” she said, adding that though it facilitates the spread of white supremacy, it is also a “viable competitor for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>power” in terms of advocating for transgender rights.</p>
<p class="p2">“I appreciated the attention (the panelists) paid to race, class (and) gender equity and trying to go beyond this idea that all Republicans are white men, all Democrats are people who support minorities, because it’s a lot bigger than that,” said Sophia Giglio ’19, who attended the event. The panelists were “clearly trying to inspire some activism and prevent people from feeling discouraged, which feels important,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">William Allen, adjunct lecturer in international and public affairs, attended the event after closely following election results because he “needed someone to connect the dots,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">“There were a lot of really valuable insights today,” Allen said. “It’s not the big wave that many of us had hoped for, but it’s significant progress. The challenge, as Professor Schiller said, is to build on that. I thought that was a really good way of ending.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>City Council to vote on Hope Point Tower</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/09/city-council-vote-hope-point-tower/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Following two public hearings on the proposed Hope Point Tower project, the Providence Committee on Ordinances voted Thursday night to open the project to a full City Council vote.</p>
<p class="p4">The Hope Point Tower is a 600-foot-tall luxury apartment complex slated to be built on former I-195 land downtown. If the tower receives the necessary zoning approval from the City Council, it will be the tallest building in Providence and the tallest residential tower in New England.</p>
<p class="p4">As early as next Thursday, the City Council could vote on whether to approve the proposal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Out-of-state developer Jason Fane hopes to build the tower on a parcel of land zoned for 100-foot-tall buildings — a restriction created three years ago under a city-wide, comprehensive zoning plan.</p>
<p class="p4">The ordinances committee’s recommendation to approve the plan came down to a three-to-one vote.</p>
<p class="p4">Throughout the meeting, Ward 13 Councilperson Bryan Principe — who voted against the zoning change — voiced frustration with the proposal, saying that it did not comply with the comprehensive plan’s guidelines.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’re sticking it to developers,” Principe said, explaining that other development projects have had to follow the comprehensive zoning rules. “We’re saying to everybody else, ‘We’re for sale.’”</p>
<p class="p4">Ward 5 Councilperson Jo-Ann Ryan, who voted to move the proposal forward, disagreed.</p>
<p class="p4">“We need to say to other developers, ‘We’re here, and we’re open for business,’” Ryan said, calling the project a “once-in-a-decade opportunity.” Ryan voiced support for the tower because of its potential to create jobs, a proposition that drew laughter from some in the audience.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thursday night’s meeting was not a public hearing but an opportunity for the ordinance committee to discuss the tower and vote on whether to move the proposal forward. The event drew supporters and protesters in smaller numbers than previous meetings had.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Jeffrey Padwa, one of the Fane Organization’s lawyers, attempted to submit additional information for consideration by the committee. But Providence lawyer Nicole Martucci objected to Padwa’s prolonged speech since public hearings on the matter had already been closed.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After the meeting, Ward 12 Councilperson Terence Hassett told The Herald that projects like the construction of Providence Place Mall and the renovation of the Masonic Lodge had faced similar opposition during their approval processes but had later proved successful. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Hassett, who plans to retire in December, said that he wanted to move the project forward before he left office.</p>
<p class="p4">“I didn’t want to walk away from this,” he said, adding that he supported the proposal’s ability to create union jobs.</p>
<p class="p4">The Fane Organization’s team was pleased by the results. “We’re gratified that we received the support of the Ordinance Committee,” Dante Bellini, Fane’s spokesperson said, adding that he is looking forward to next week’s vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Protesters call for Senate to protect Mueller probe</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Community members surrounded the R.I. State House late Thursday afternoon to denounce President Trump’s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general. Over 900 other demonstrations took place across the country to protest the appointment as an obstruction to the investigation of Trump’s relationship with Russia, said rally organizer and IndivisibleRI founder Andy Acciaioli.</p>
<p class="p4">In collaboration with national progressive advocacy group MoveOn, Indivisible — a volunteer collective with over 6,000 chapters — planned the Providence rally late Wednesday after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions accepted Trump’s request to resign, Acciaioli told The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">Following Sessions’ resignation, Whitaker is now in charge of Robert Mueller’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s potential ties to Russia. In a CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/06/opinions/rosenstein-should-curb-mueller-whittaker-opinion/index.html">op-ed</a> originally published Aug. 6, 2017, Whitaker publicly criticized the probe for “going too far.”</p>
<p class="p4">As acting attorney general, Whitaker will likely either stop the investigation or defund it, said Assistant Executive Director of IndivisibleRI Shawna Rihani. Whitaker’s public defense of Trump demonstrates that he is a “Trump loyalist,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“Mueller could get fired tomorrow,” Rihani said from the steps of the State House. “We are on the cusp of a national emergency, and it is our responsibility to make our voices heard.”</p>
<p class="p4">Rally attendees shouted “Lock him up” — a jab at Trump’s 2016 campaign chant about then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton — and thrust signs into the air, some of which read “No One is Above The Law” and “Innocent Presidents Don’t Act This Way! PROTECT MUELLER INVESTIGATION.”</p>
<p class="p4">IndivisibleRI Area Director Kamila Barzykowkski called for Whitaker to recuse himself from the investigation to keep Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in control of the probe. She also demanded that the Senate pass special protections to safeguard the investigation, such as the one Sens. Jeff Flake, R-AZ, and Chris Coons, D-DE,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/08/flake-coons-mueller-protection-bill-978362">planning to introduce</a>.</p>
<p class="p4">“We are here today to … tell the Republican Senate (that) to remain silent is no longer an option,” Barzykowkski said. “They must obey their oaths to protect our Constitution.”</p>
<p class="p4">In between speeches, IndivisibleRI Advisory Board Member Steven Beleaus played the guitar and sang songs that underscored the rally’s focus, including “Heart of God” by Neil Young and a modified rendition of “Ohio” by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. “There’s an obstruction of justice comin’, we’re finally on our own. This feels a lot like Nixon,” Beleaus sang.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When Donald Trump moves to set himself above the rule of law, he is eroding our model of democratic governance,” said State Rep. Aaron Regunberg ’12. “Trump and the Republican party’s cabals of white supremacy and oligarchy are taking steps not just to drag us back further toward the oppression and inequality we’ve been fighting against since our founding, … but they’re actually moving to attack … the fundamental tools that we need to continue this American project.”</span></p>
<p class="p4">Philip Graham, IndivisibleRI advisory board member, encouraged protesters to celebrate the results of the midterm elections — Democrats now have control of the House of Representatives — but urged Democrats to begin organizing to flip Senate seats in 2020, calling for voters to oust senators such as Sens. Susan Collins, R-ME, and Cory Gardner, R-CO.</p>
<p class="p4">“We won one, but we’re not done, … 2020, here we come,” Graham chanted with the crowd.</p>
<p class="p4">While R.I. residents may take to calling their senators, they should push constituents in red states to organize, since Sens. Jack Reed, D-RI, and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, already support efforts to protect the Mueller investigation, Acciaioli said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“Our democracy is in danger,” protester Walter Reice told The Herald. “The investigation should take its course, and the American people should be informed of what (Mueller) finds.”</span></p>
<p class="p4">Other protesters pointed to the confirmation process of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford and multiple other women, as evidence of a lack of integrity in public life. Rally attendee Ella Fitzgerald held a “BELIEVE SURVIVORS” sign and told The Herald, “I don’t know if I can have complete faith in the Federal Bureau of Investigation based on their interviewing process of Dr. Ford.”</p>
<p class="p4">Looking forward, Acciaioli anticipates IndivisibleRI will join other Indivisible chapters around the country in calling senators and visiting Washington to fight Whitaker’s appointment.</p>
<p class="p4">“We have so much work to do. I guess this is the beginning of 2020, right?” Rihani said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>R.I. gun safety working group to inform governor&#039;s decisions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The October findings of Gov. Gina Raimondo’s Working Group for Gun Safety — the 43-member collective that worked to study gun violence in Rhode Island for over six months — are informing many of the Governor’s conversations in preparation for the start of the January legislative session, wrote Deputy Press Secretary of the Governor’s Office Audrey Lucas in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p4">The group was first convened by the Governor in February following the Parkland Florida shooting and included health professionals, law enforcement, educators and other community members.</p>
<p class="p4">Members met five times over several months and worked across six different subcommittees to examine current gun safety measures and to provide future suggestions for the Governor, said Associate Professor of Health Services, Policy and Practice, Emergency Medicine and working group co-chair Megan Ranney.</p>
<p class="p4">“This task force was very focused,” said James Manni, town manager of Narragansett and co-chair of the working group. “We made some very common-sense, specific recommendations.”</p>
<p class="p4">In its October Final Report, the working group advised stricter regulation of military-style assault weapons and a ban on high-capacity magazines, ghost guns and 3D-printed guns.</p>
<p class="p4">Ghost guns — guns that are made at home as to avoid being traced — were identified as a potential loophole in R.I. law. These guns can be purchased 80 percent completed and are later finished by obtaining the frame or receiver separately, which is where the serial number of the gun is printed, Manni said. While the task force initially began studying ghost guns as a possibility in Rhode Island, the state had its first documented case when a <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180523/50-arrested-as-state-police-target-ri-biker-gangs">biker gang was arrested</a> for dealing ghost guns in late May, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">While there are over 50 laws in the state regarding guns, some were found to be dated, with some even originating in the 1960s, Manni said.</p>
<p class="p4">Ranney does not find the proposal to ban guns to be controversial because the report is comprised of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“consensus recommendations” that “came out of the experiences of many gun owners.” She added that nearly half of the working group members were gun owners who wanted to find common sense resolutions.</p>
<p class="p4">Members of the working group also provided mental health resources, data collection of gun-related incidents and school-specific recommendations. “(What) really hit home to me was listening to the educators’ stories and the fear that they live through in their schools worrying about a mass shooting and what they would do. … As someone who works in the healthcare field, I see the effects of guns in almost every shift that I work in the ER, but I don’t work as a teacher, and I don’t experience that … first-hand fear of teachers and students,” Ranney said. She added that the report recommended increasing the number of counselors and school psychologists as well as the number of non-violence and anti-bullying programs.</p>
<p class="p4">Jennifer Boylan of the gun prevention advocacy group Mom’s Demand Action was enthusiastic about the working group’s final report and hopes that the Governor will continue to prioritize gun safety. “We’re excited about the whole process … and her commitment to working on this problem.”</p>
<p class="p4">Still, Boylan sees opportunities for the state legislature to tighten gun safety measures. While Raimondo signed an executive order in August barring firearms from Pre-K to 12 schools back in August, Boylan argues that criminal penalties need to be formalized by the state legislature. Boylan also hopes Rhode Island can raise the minimum age to buy an assault weapon from 18 to 21, after a bill with that proposal did not make it out of committee last spring.</p>
<p class="p4">“The Governor looks forward to working with her colleagues in the General Assembly during the next session to pass common sense, meaningful legislation to keep Rhode Islanders safe,” Lucas said.</p>
<p class="p4">Looking forward, Ranney acknowledges that reducing gun violence in the state “will not happen overnight” because “guns are part of the culture of the United States.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Teas and Javas closes in Wayland Square</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Teas and Javas, a cafe launched by Alex and Ani Chief Executive Officer Carolyn Rafaelian, closed its Wayland Square location Oct. 11. The cafe will be replaced by Bar and Board Bistro, also owned by Rafaelian, in early 2019.</p>
<p class="p2">Teas and Javas opened its first-ever location at Wayland Square in 2012 and offered Providence residents brunch fixtures paired with coffee, tea, wine and beer.</p>
<p class="p2">The cafe shut its doors abruptly after months of local rumors that it was closing, said Nikki Patrizzi, general manager of the Wayland Square West Elm store.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’re all really bummed,” Patrizzi added. Teas and Javas “was a nice staple for the square.”</p>
<p class="p2">Liz Kelley, visual manager of the Wayland Square West Elm location, recalled Teas and Javas’ lavender chai with fondness. The cafe “was one of those coffee shops where you could sit outside, and everyone was always hanging out and lounging,” Kelley said. “It was a good vibe.”</p>
<p class="p2">Teas and Javas “brought a wide range (of people), demographic-wise, from students to working professionals” to Wayland Square, Patrizzi said. “It was just a nice eclectic mix, and we were lucky to have them.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other restaurants in Wayland Square include Pasta Beach, Salted Slate and Red Stripe. The closing of Teas and Javas leaves Starbucks and L’Artisan Cafe and Bakery as the primary coffee shops in the center of Wayland Square. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Assistant Manager of L’Artisan Meirav Werbel reported noticing a slight increase in the bakery’s business immediately after Teas and Javas closed.</p>
<p class="p2">Bar and Board Bistro replaced another Teas and Javas location in Newport but has been undergoing renovations after a fire in 2015.</p>
<p class="p2">Bar and Board’s entry is “good for the neighborhood, for the customers,” Werbel said. “As long as their business is in the neighborhood, then I think it’s wonderful.”</p>
<p class="p2">Kelley noted that many businesses in Newport were looking at Providence for a second location.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s not like we want just anything coming in, but it seems like if it’s doing well in Newport, it could do well here,” Kelley said about Bar and Board.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite Teas and Javas’ departure, Patrizzi believes the area is “on the uptick.”</p>
<p class="p2">“We’re just really trying to turn (Wayland Square) into a hub for people to come meet, see beautiful art and for it to be a lively place,” Patrizzi said.</p>
<p class="p2">Wayland Square is “just one of those spots on the East Side where it’s pleasant to walk,” Kelley said. “There’s a lot of new families moving in, and it’s kind of just bustling. There’s just this great vibe of ‘Come and eat and hang out and walk.’”</p>
<p class="p2">A spokesperson from Alex and Ani declined to comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University changes policy to expand paid sick, safe leave to all University employees</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All University employees became eligible to take paid sick and safe leave after the University adjusted its policy to comply with the Rhode Island Sick and Safe Leave Act this month. The updated policy extends the amount of paid leave available to part-time and student employees and broadens the circumstances qualifying for leave-taking, said Jeffrey Jakulevicius, the University’s benefit compliance analyst.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The law allows employees to receive paid leave to care for any member of their household or to handle safety issues such as stalking or domestic violence, in addition to coping with personal health issues, said Nora Crowley, the chief public affairs officer at the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the past few months, Jakulevicius said he worked with the Director of Benefits Drew Murphy to adapt the University’s paid leave policies to the legislation. Now, undergraduate and graduate student workers can take off up to six hours through Dec. 31 and break up this amount into 15 minute increments. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Under the new policy, employees can leave work to address safety issues or take care of personal health problems, and students can potentially provide care for their roommate under an expanded definition of caregiver, Murphy said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When taking time off, University employees are expected to follow normal call-in procedures.“We would like to make sure that if somebody is actually sick, … they don’t have to make the decision between not being paid and having to come into work,” Jakulevicius said, adding that the new act also works to promote productivity in the work place. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the act allows employers to ask workers for documentation after missing consecutive days of work, the University’s policy does not mandate employees to present evidence explaining their absence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We felt that the cost-benefit wasn’t there (and) that we should just allow employees to request the time as needed without forcing them to provide documentation because just the conversation alone that surrounds the documentation could be problematic,” Jakulevicius said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Previously the University’s sick leave policy only applied to employees working “50 percent time or more,” Murphy said. Since this policy complied with the Sick and Safe Leave Act, these employees were not given additional sick days beyond the 12 they currently receive each year, he added. But these workers can now designate up to three of these days in 2018 for caregiving or safety concerns. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The RI Sick and Safe Leave Act, which went into effect in mid-summer after Gov. Gina Raimondo signed it in September 2017, applies to state employers — like the University — with 18 or more employees, Crowley said. With the act’s implementation, employees are guaranteed to receive 24 hours of sick and safe leave in 2018, 32 hours in 2019 and up to 40 hours by 2020. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Department for Labor and Training is currently treating the Sick and Safe Leave Act’s first six months as a “grace period” for employers to make the necessary changes to their leave-taking policies, Crowley said. If an employer denies an employee benefits provided under the Sick and Safe Leave Act, the department will work to ensure the worker’s compensation. But the department will wait until Jan. 1 to penalize employers for noncompliance, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s a great bill,” said Aaron Ziemer ’19, a member of the Brown Student Labor Alliance. “It’s fundamentally important that everyone has the ability to take off work no matter how much money they have.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hope Point Tower moves closer to zoning approval</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Providence City Council voted to approve a change in city height ordinances for the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/23/city-council-hosts-hearing-hope-point-tower/">Hope Point Tower Project</a> Thursday night. The Council will need to vote one more time on the issue before it goes to Mayor Jorge Elorza’s desk for final approval. Even with initial height approval, the I-195 Redevelopment District Commission will retain influence over the design process, according to Peter McNally, the Commission’s executive director.</p>
<p class="p2">The proposed Hope Point Tower is a 600-foot-tall luxury apartment complex slated to be built on former I-195 land in downtown Providence. If the tower receives the necessary zoning approval from City Council, it will be the tallest building in Providence and the tallest residential tower in New England. The project has already received approval from the Commission, which owns the land on which the tower would be built.</p>
<p class="p2">If Elorza, who has yet to come out with an official stance on the project, rejects the ordinance change, the Council has the power to overrule his decision. The Mayor “is waiting on full council passage and hopefully a refined design before making a final decision,” spokesperson Emily Crowell told WPRI.</p>
<p class="p2">The issues have divided the city. Before the vote, the Providence Preservation Society submitted a petition with 1,809 signatures to the mayor and City Council, opposing the proposed development. PPS also took out a full-page ad in Thursday’s edition of the Providence Journal, urging city residents to contact their council members and advocate against the building. The Providence Journal published an editorial Wednesday endorsing the building, writing, “We hope and trust the City Council will do the right thing, putting the people’s interests ahead of the loud naysayers and special interests.”</p>
<p class="p2">At the meeting, Providence resident Valentina Adamore told The Herald that she opposes the tower.</p>
<p class="p2">With the Superman skyscraper standing empty, the “reduce, reuse, recycle” method would work much better than building a new project, Adamore said.</p>
<p class="p2">Although some residents have been skeptical of the project’s benefits, labor unions have supported the initiative because of the commitment of the developer, the Fane Organization to use 100 percent union labor.</p>
<p class="p2">“The city can certainly use the tax money it will generate,” said President of the Providence Central Federated Council Paul MacDonald, pointing out the project’s $300 million price tag.</p>
<p class="p2">Though he said that the residents opposing the project are good people, “most of those people are not worried about the price of a gallon of gasoline,” MacDonald added.</p>
<p class="p2">At the meeting, Ward 10 Councilman Luis Aponte also expressed enthusiasm for the project’s potential to bring in sizable amounts of tax revenue. Explaining that much of Providence’s properties are non-taxable, he urged the Council to approve the project with consideration of its taxability. Every time “Brown wants a nicer facility for its professors and students,” the city has to consider where they are going to collect revenues, Aponte said.</p>
<p class="p2">On the other hand, Ward 2 Councilman Samuel Zurier focused on the “more than $81 million” in tax incentives to be granted to the Fane Organization if the tower is approved.</p>
<p class="p2">“This is classic trickle down economics,” he said, adding that the income generated by the tower after its construction will pale in comparison to the tax cuts.</p>
<p class="p2">Ward 5 Councilwoman Jo-Ann Ryan spoke in favor of the tower.</p>
<p class="p2">“I agree we have an affordable housing crisis,” Ryan said, but it “should not be placed on the back of the developer” and instead should be the city’s responsibility.</p>
<p class="p2">Yesterday’s meeting featured a proposed amendment to the ordinance change in addition to several impassioned speeches from council members. Ward 3 City Councilwoman Nirva LaFortune introduced an amendment requiring that 15 percent of any residential project built on the lot must qualify as “low-and-moderate income housing.” If the developer decides to exclude the affordable units, the amendment mandated that they would have to pay a fee. LaFortune’s proposal also required the City Plan Commission to review and approve the project’s design and layout to make sure a proposed park nearby would not be negatively impacted. After some discussion, the amendment was dismissed as irrelevant to the zoning ordinance at hand.</p>
<p class="p2">Ward 13 Councilman Bryan Principe, who strongly disagrees with the zoning change, motioned to introduce an amendment to throw out all the city’s zoning ordinances, but then promptly retracted it.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite arguments against the zoning change, Fane spokesperson Dante Bellini said he is “gratified” that the Council passed the first vote and is looking forward to the next one. “We’re hoping history repeats itself,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">PPS Executive Director Brent Runyon has not lost hope yet in preventing the zoning change.</p>
<p class="p2">“Anything’s possible in politics,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Legal sports betting begins in R.I.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Just outside Lincoln, slot machines glittered and chirped as gamers clutched Cash Out Vouchers and roamed around the halls. The new flat screen TVs flashed sports statistics and spreads as bookies prepared to accept the first ceremonial wagers. This was the scene at the Twin River Casino Monday as legal sports betting kicked off in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p4">Rhode Island legalized sports betting in June 2018, one month after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to let state governments decide the legality of the industry. As of Nov. 26, the Twin River Casino in Lincoln is the only location open for gamers to legally place sports bets in New England. The casino plans to introduce sports betting in two phases. Phase One, rolled out Monday, consists of a more “traditional, Vegas-style sportsbook,” said Patti Doyle, spokeswoman for the casino. Bets can be placed on the NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and NCAA teams at the book or nearby terminals. Doyle added that gamers are not permitted to place bets on Rhode Island sports teams, which includes those at the University.</p>
<p class="p4">Phase Two is set to launch in mid-December and consists of a new 3,600-square-foot sports lounge: “A tailgate party without having to go outside,” said Craig Sculos, vice president and general manager of property management at Twin Rivers Casino. He added that the lounge will be covered with approximately 100 TVs and have a dedicated dining service and bar. The renovation bill totaled near $1.5 million, according to John Taylor, chairman of the Board of Directors for Twin River Worldwide Holdings Inc.</p>
<p class="p4">In two to three months, sports betting will be expanded to the Twin Rivers Casino in Tiverton, Sculos said.</p>
<p class="p4">Rhode Island’s development of sports betting infrastructure taps into an industry that, while illegal, was estimated to generate $150 billion nationwide each year, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/sports/sports-betting.html">The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s just an illicit industry, an untapped source of revenue,” said Ryan Burke ’19, who worked as a quantitative trading intern for a sports analytics group this summer, coding win probability models for in-game betting. He compared the potential markets in the United States to preexisting legal ones in Europe. “It’s already a big industry in Europe,” he said. “There’s a lot of industry that’s being generated over there. I think that by legalizing it you create a lot of tax revenue for the states.”</p>
<p class="p4">“In Rhode Island, it’s a new revenue stream, which is seen as really important in state,” said Hillary Levey Friedman, a visiting assistant professor of education who has taught the course EDUC 0860: “Sports in American Society.”</p>
<p class="p4">Rhode Island is in need of new revenue; the state predicted a $158 million budget deficit next year, according to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rhode-island/articles/2018-08-22/rhode-island-faces-158-million-in-deficit-for-budget">U.S. News</a>. Legal gambling is already a vital part of the state budget — the estimated $309 million added to the budget for the next fiscal year would make up the third-largest source of revenue in the state, according to Paul Grimaldi, public information officer at the R.I. Department of Revenue.</p>
<p class="p4">Fifty-one percent of casino revenue goes to the state, Doyle said. In 2015, Rhode Island had the highest average state revenue generated by gambling in the country — $457 per adult — compared to the next highest of $418 in Nevada and the $113 average nationwide, according to a <a href="https://rockinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2016-04-12-Blinken_Report_Three-min.pdf">report by the Rockefeller Institute</a>. The legalization of sports betting is predicted to give the already profitable gambling industry in the state a boost and possibly help free up funds to be invested in other state priorities.</p>
<p class="p4">President of the Rhode Island Senate Dominick Ruggerio, D-4, spoke at the sports betting opening Monday, where he suggested that some of the funds may go toward renovations for schools. “The money’s gonna go to a great cause,” Ruggerio said. “We have a referendum coming out, and we have a whole bunch of things we have to pay for. Revenue never hurts.” He also placed one of the first ceremonial wagers, betting $20 on the Houston Texans’ game Monday night.</p>
<p class="p4">Sports betting is an appealing option for those who would not normally partake in traditional gambling: “Being able to throw $5 down on a sports game is a lot more interesting of a bet and gamble than just a scratch card,” said Ryan Ma ’19.</p>
<p class="p4">Ma also emphasized the importance of legalization and regulation of the industry; “Regulation is really important, I think it just eliminates a lot of risk … for people interested in the community and interested (in) sports gambling.”</p>
<p class="p4">While Monday’s launch at the casino brings hope for the state’s financial future, some Rhode Islanders worry about “cannibalizing their own services” by losing gamers who have historically participated in traditional betting in favor of sports betting, Grimaldi said.</p>
<p class="p4">As Rhode Island continues to develop its sports betting infrastructure, Grimaldi said he hopes to make mobile betting available to further grow revenue. At the moment, the casino only takes bets on location, and it limits the sort of bets that bettors can place, possibly hurting their chance at developing a market and gaining vital revenue before other states move forward.</p>
<p class="p4">The <a href="http://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/19740480/gambling-sports-betting-bill-tracker-all-50-states">other states</a> that have already legalized sports betting on a full scale are Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="p4">“I have waited 40 years for this,” Ruggerio said at the press conference Monday. “I have been coming down here every week to see if it actually happened.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">States neighboring Rhode Island are going green — and not only as a result of environmental concerns. The first recreational dispensaries in Massachusetts opened Nov. 20 to long lines spilling out of their doors. Connecticut’s governor-elect, Ned Lamont, <a href="https://www.apnews.com/da223d6fe8c946b0a29d45cd08019cda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been outspoken</a> about his support for legalization, and the<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/16/17576276/new-york-health-department-marijuana-legalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> New York Department of Health</a> recommended in July that the state permit recreational use. Vermont became the ninth state to legalize recreational marijuana possession this summer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re going to be an island of prohibition if we don’t act soon,” said Jared Moffat ’13, a director at Regulate Rhode Island, a local branch of the Marijuana Policy Project. “The fact that every state around us is moving toward (legalization) means we’re going to have to deal with the reality of legalization whether one likes it or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The two fully licensed dispensaries that opened in Massachusetts are located between an hour and an hour and a half away from Providence. Rhode Island residents over 21 can legally purchase the product in Massachusetts, but possession of more than one ounce is considered a misdemeanor in Rhode Island, Moffat said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“Whether it’s gray market or actual legal cannabis, people from Rhode Island, just by proximity, are going to find a way to indulge,” said Nadir Pearson ’19, founder and president of the Student Marijuana Alliance for Research &amp; Transparency. The gray market, in this case, includes Massachusetts residents’ legal right to “gift” up to one ounce of weed, Pearson added.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moffat said he is hoping that regional change will force the Rhode Island legislature to move toward legalization, which has thus far been stymied. A legalization bill sponsored by Rep. Scott Slater D-10 and Sen. Joshua Miller D-28, didn’t move forward in the House or the Senate in 2016. Another bill, titled “Adult Use of Cannabis Act,” died in the House Judiciary in 2017. Slater will be leading another charge to pass a recreational legalization bill in the House in the 2019 legislative session and predicts that enthusiastic backing from the governor, speaker or senate president will be a necessity for its success.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moffat argues that legalization would allow the government to develop regulations and public safety plans, such as educating people about the risks of driving under the influence of marijuana. He also cited the 20,000 jobs Massachusetts could gain — “jobs we’re not getting (in) Rhode Island” — and the tax dollars forfeited if the state’s lack of progress in this area continues. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moffat, who helped Slater craft the 2016 bill, believes that Speaker of the House Nicholas Mattiello D-15 and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio D-4 are partially responsible for the continued illegality of recreational marijuana because “they’ve never even allowed a vote on the bill,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Mattiello has not recently articulated a definitive position on the matter, though he has voiced concerns with legalization, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20161231/in-2017-ri-assembly-session-is-all-about-paying-for-promises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Providence Journal reported</a>.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The sale of recreational marijuana will raise revenues for our state, but it will also increase social costs and public safety concerns,” wrote Larry Berman, communications director for Mattiello’s office, in an email to The Herald. “We will have to determine what the net impact would be for Rhode Island in light of the legal sales in Massachusetts.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ruggerio did not respond to The Herald’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A Rhode Island legislative commission to study the impacts of recreational marijuana legalization began in 2017. The final report was originally planned for March 2018, but it has since been pushed to February 2019. Slater is pessimistic about seeing the report at all, saying that the commission has become “bogged down” by conflicting views about legalization. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Slater has no doubt legalization would garner public support; a recent<a href="https://www.wpri.com/politics/wpri-12rwu-poll-majority-in-ri-favor-legalized-marijuana/1560437134" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> WPRI poll</a> found a majority of Rhode Islanders want legalization of recreational marijuana for those over 21. But in the House, support would depend on the specific language and content of the bill, Slater said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“I’m still working the issue, but I do believe I have the support amongst the members if you polled them. … But certain folks will want to see certain things in the bill,” Slater said. Content up for debate includes the destination of the prospective tax revenue and whether or not the state will expunge criminal records for marijuana possession.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Because Rhode Island already has infrastructure for medical marijuana growth and distribution, implementation of recreational marijuana would be seamless, Slater said. Right now in the state, cultivators are only allowed to sell to medical marijuana dispensaries — which has created more marijuana supply than there is legal demand, said Spencer Blier, founder and CEO of Mammoth Inc., a cultivation center in Warwick. The Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation issued over 30 licenses to cultivators, yet there are only three “compassion centers” in the state. None of these centers are necessarily reliant on cultivators because they can<a href="http://www.dbr.ri.gov/divisions/medicalmarijuana/approvals.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> grow their own marijuana</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recreational marijuana “is really the only thing long-term that’s going to help us,” Blier said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Rhode Island House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello’s close win in the November election this month could reflect a larger divide within the Democratic party between progressive and moderate party members.</p>
<p class="p2">A Democrat from Cranston, Mattiello has often been criticized for being too conservative. Mattiello — who has an A+ rating with the National Rifle Association — has described himself as a “firewall” against “ultra left-wing groups” in an interview with WPRO-radio.</p>
<p class="p2">As current Speaker of the R.I. House of Representatives, some have said Mattiello’s power rivals the governor’s. His powers include setting the calendar and agenda for legislative sessions and appointing all standing committees and their chairs within the House.</p>
<p class="p2">Larry Berman, Mattiello’s spokesperson, explained that the government of Rhode Island gives “a strong voice to those elected officials who are closest to the people of the state, which is our Representatives.”</p>
<p class="p2">Earlier this month, Mattiello narrowly defeated Republican candidate Steven Frias ’94 by less than 400 votes. This was a wider margin of victory than his 2016 win over Frias, which was less than 100 votes, according to the Rhode Island Board of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elections.</p>
<p class="p2">In addition to facing a Republican opponent at the ballot box, Mattiello faced opposition within his own party. Berman wrote that “the ultra-left wing formed coalitions to oppose (Mattiello’s) re-election in November.”</p>
<p class="p2">Brown students have constituted part of this opposition. Before the elections, members of the campus organization Thoughts Prayers Action and the nonpartisan student group Brown Progressive Action Committee canvassed against Mattiello in Cranston.</p>
<p class="p2">Gabe Mernoff ’22, a Rhode Island local and member of TPA, was one of the students that canvassed against the speaker. Calling Mattiello a Democrat in name only, or “DINO,” Mernoff said that “looking at party lines in Rhode Island is misleading.”</p>
<p class="p2">Mernoff believes that Mattiello uses the powers he has as Speaker to prevent a vote on gun legislation.</p>
<p class="p2">Bump stock bans, ‘red flag’ legislation that enabled courts to take guns from individuals deemed “dangerous” and a bill that removed guns from convicted domestic abusers had all been passed during Mattiello’s term, according to Berman. When elected to a third term as Speaker, Mattiello will ensure that “all gun-related bills that are introduced in the next session will receive full and fair public hearings by the House Judiciary Committee, and then it will be up to the members of that committee to weigh the testimony,” Berman wrote.</p>
<p class="p2">Mattiello received a majority in a Democratic Caucus vote for speaker held Nov. 8. Though the vote will not be made official until Jan. 1, when the House enters its new term, many predict that he will continue in the position.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite Mattiello’s more conservative leanings, Mernoff said he would not be surprised if Mattiello were reelected as speaker again because there are other conservative Democrats in his corner.</p>
<p class="p2">Mernoff explained that in general the R.I.Democratic party’s platform “does not line up with the Democratic Party on the national level” because the state platform is much more conservative.</p>
<p class="p2">Technically, Brown College Democrats is also under the state Democratic party as a part of the College Democrats of Rhode Island. Rose Lang-Maso ’20, president of the Brown Democrats, said the group has to be careful not to undermine its state-level partner. As a result, the Dems are limited in what they can say about Mattiello, she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p2">“We generally have a policy of supporting Democrats who embody our shared democratic values,” Lang-Maso said. For instance, the Dems espouse<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>abortion rights, accessible health care and stricter gun safety legislation.</p>
<p class="p2">“Because he’s in the more conservative wing of the party, we don’t feel he’s met these commitments,” Lang-Maso said. “But we’re hopeful that he will.”</p>
<p class="p2">“As Democrats and voters, we really do have to hold the Speaker accountable,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">In a statement to The Herald, Brown Progressive Action Committee Chair Julia Kirschenbaum ’19 wrote, “Mattiello might be a ‘Democrat,’ but he exemplifies the conservatism that persists within the Rhode Island Democratic Party as an institution.” She added that the group“ will continue to demand legislative oversight that places checks on the power of the House Speaker in Rhode Island.”</p>
<p class="p2">Regarding gun legislation, TPA said that they will work toward stricter gun laws by writing letters to representatives, including Mattiello, and testifying at the State House. “We believe if (stricter gun legislation) reached the floor it would pass,” TPA media co-chair Kevin Boyce ’21 said, explaining that they are laws that <a href="https://www.ricagv.org/ri-public-opinion-polling-data/">most Rhode Islanders agree with</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">In the coming term, “the Speaker will remain focused on passing legislation and enacting a budget that focuses on improving the job climate and economic opportunities,” Berman wrote.</p>
<p class="p2">Mattiello’s close win in the November elections will not necessarily impact his policy positions, Berman wrote.“The time for politics is over and it is now time to focus on governing and enacting policies and legislation to move the state forward.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">After several public hearings and a litany of high-profile City Council committee votes, Mayor Jorge Elorza vetoed a height ordinance change for the proposed 46-story Hope Point Tower Friday afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The decision from Elorza comes a little more than a week after the City Council approved the tower in a nine-to-five vote with one abstention. To override the Mayor’s decision, the Council needs a supermajority of 10 votes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The tower was slated to be built on former I-195 land downtown, which is currently zoned for 100-foot-tall buildings. The height limit was established under a comprehensive zoning plan for the city three years ago, The Herald previously reported. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a letter to the City Council, Elorza wrote that his veto was motivated by the Fane Organization’s unwillingness “to provide assurances that the city’s design recommendations would not be disregarded” when developing the tower.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elorza explained that he requested “that the city, either through the (Downtown Design Review Committee) or the Planning Department, have final approval over the design of the project, rather than merely advisory input,” he wrote. “If this building is going to reshape our skyline, then the city should be able to approve what it looks like.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Initially proposed by developer Jason Fane in November 2016, the tower would guarantee “public benefits” like maintaining a nearby pedestrian bridge, Elorza wrote. Additionally, the Fane Organization promised to build the tower within a reasonable time frame to prevent the lot from remaining vacant for too long, he added. Elorza wrote that, though these are important considerations, the design of the building remains his top priority and the primary motivation for his veto.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Jason Fane is disappointed in the Mayor’s action today,” Fane Spokesperson Dante Bellini wrote in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Calling the veto a “punitive action against this specific project and the economic development Hope Point represents,” Bellini said that Fane has already made compromises to suit the city and people of Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Leading up the Mayor’s announcement, local neighborhood groups like the Jewelry District Association and the College Hill Neighborhood Association opposed the building, The Herald previously reported.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Providence Preservation Society joined local neighborhood associations in protesting the tower. In a statement, PPS’s Executive Director Brent Runyon called the proposed zoning change “short-sighted and destructive” and thanked Elorza “for putting the city’s interests above the interest of one developer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After the City Council initially approved the height change, Runyon told The Herald that he was disappointed in the decision. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhode Island union workers, on the other hand, have been some of the tower’s strongest proponents.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tweeting at Elorza following the decision, the Rhode Island Painter’s Union wrote, “Shameful ! @Jorge Elorza this is a foolish decision. Sad to see you turn your back on working people of this city!”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If the City Council votes to override Elorza’s veto, the tower would be the tallest building in Rhode Island. The City Council has not yet released an agenda for its next meeting, which will take place Thursday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since establishing its first U.S. location in Providence in Feb. 2018, Shiru Cafe has yet to secure any corporate sponsors for its operations in the United States. Even without sponsors and the revenue sponsorships would provide, Shiru Cafe continues to expand domestically — opening its doors at Amherst College yesterday and preparing to establish cafes at Yale and Princeton.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Shiru, which in Japanese means “to know,” operates under a business model wherein students list their contact information, majors, skills and career interests in exchange for free coffee. The cafe’s mission is “to create a place where students can learn about the professional world and envision their careers,” according to the company’s website. It hopes to bring locations to “the top (universities) in the world,” wrote Shiru Cafe CEO Yusuke Kakimoto in an email to The Herald, adding that his next target locations in the United States are Harvard, Columbia and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The parent company Enrission founded the Shiru cafe chain in Kyoto, Japan in 2013. In addition to 17 cafes in Japan, Shiru operates 28 cafes worldwide, according to its website. While the cafes in Japan tend to have over 180 corporate sponsors, Shiru cafes in America have yet to form partnerships with any corporations, according to General Manager at Enrission and Cafe Manager at Brown’s Shiru Cafe Keith Maher. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As part of fortified efforts to create ties with U.S. sponsors, Enrission brought on Vice President of Client Development and Strategy for Shiru in the U.S. Isabel Strobing in October 2018. Her job is to establish relationships between Shiru and potential sponsors by partnering “with companies looking to innovate their recruitment strategies,” according to her position description on LinkedIn. “We really want to provide students all over the country with these different opportunities and … learn more about industries or types of companies they might not know about,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Providence’s Shiru Cafe generates some revenue through selling pastries, its offerings to University students of free coffee in house and $1 coffee to go necessitate funding by its parent company Enrission, Maher said. “The rest of the equation is kind of still coming together” for the cafe’s American financial model, Strobing added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the past 10 months, the cafe has been focused on preparing to partner with sponsors, which requires<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>addressing “logistical issues” including “real estate and getting the cafe up and running,” Strobing explained. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Enrission maintains close involvement in oversight of U.S. cafes as they are “always in contact with the CEO in Japan,” Maher said. Strobing described Enrission as “very well integrated” into the Providence cafe and cited “support and training” provided by Enrission. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even with close oversight, “everything and nothing is the norm,” as Enrission allows Shiru in Providence enough autonomy to explore the best strategies for succeeding in the new and different U.S. market, Strobing added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The company is still<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“definitely very early in the stages of developing those relationships and sponsorships,” Maher said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re getting ready to welcome sponsors soon,” Kakimoto wrote. The company may establish ties with its first sponsors as early as next semester, and Strobing said it was feasible that they may be brought on board as early as January. Shiru Cafe has initiated contact with some companies, while others have reached out to the cafe themselves. More companies have reached out to Shiru as the cafe has attracted more attention through media, Strobing said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Shiru Cafe is interested in partnering with companies of varying structures and scale for its U.S. operations, from larger, well-established multinational corporations to startups, Strobing explained. She reaches out to companies on behalf of the cafe and has “seen interest from all different types of companies,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The cafe will select sponsors using the data it gathers in the survey required for students to get free coffee — noting student career and academic interests, Strobing said. “We are going to pay close attention to the data once we really start ramping up our sponsor companies,” Strobing said. The cafe also hopes to partner with sponsor companies that constitute a large part of the U.S. economy in the same way that it does in India. Shiru Cafe in India has several manufacturing corporate sponsors, since manufacturing companies proliferate in the Indian economy, Strobing explained. At the same time, student interests in the United States are very “diverse,” which makes it “quite hard to say now what our core market is going to be,” Strobing added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the cafe does not have a set quota of sponsors it hopes to fill, Kakimoto wrote that around “150 sponsors would be a good start.” Maher imagines that “the more sponsors we bring on board, the bigger benefit is for the students,” as sponsors would provide networking and career opportunities to students at the participating universities.“We don’t have that magic number,” Strobing confirmed, adding that the company does not want to “inundate students with too much information, but we want to give them the diversity of companies where they’re receiving information and meeting all the different types of professionals.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The market and geographical restraints” in the United States might alter the model of recruiting sponsors from the one used in Japan, Strobing said. The company will continue to “evaluate as we go and be open and flexible in terms of what we think makes the most sense for our students,” Strobing added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This semester, the cafe has received input from the consulting services of Brown Consulting Club. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown Consulting Club was founded last semester, and Shiru Cafe was its first client, wrote BCC Shiru Project Leader Sally Pan ’21 in an email to The Herald. The club provides the service for free, since its objective is to teach students about consulting rather than to make a profit, Pan noted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> BCC reached out to Shiru Cafe last spring “because we were sourcing for our Fall Project,” Pan wrote. The collaboration between Shiru and BCC amounts to “weekly meetings and client calls to present and discuss our deliverables,” Pan wrote. BCC’s research includes “identifying Shiru’s value proposition for potential sponsors, as well as formulating recommendations based on primary and secondary research for the client to consider and implement,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The club will reveal the results of its research in a consultation before the end of the semester, after which the groups’ collaboration will cease. But if Shiru follows up with requests for further assistance, BCC would be “happy to be of help,” Pan added. Pan believes that Shiru has the potential to expand career opportunities for University students, she wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Shiru has not planned any other collaborations with student groups at this time, but Strobing hopes to implement “more systematic options” for student groups to work with the cafe, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other University organizations have considered opportunities Shiru could provide to students. According to Director of CareerLAB Matthew Donato, CareerLAB has looked into collaboration with Shiru in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “I’ve met with the Shiru managers at least two or three times over the past year just to talk about whether there are opportunities for collaboration or whether there are ways we could share resources. We haven’t really hit on anything that seems like a good fit yet,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Regardless of the lack of sponsors for Providence’s cafe, Shiru Cafe’s management says the cafe is thriving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’ve seen a ton of success engaging with students,” Strobing said, adding that Shiru is planning on constructing even larger physical spaces for future U.S. locations. Providence’s location processes 600 orders per day, and 76 percent of Brown students are registered users, according to the company’s website. The cafe is “at full operating capacity,” Strobing said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Head Barista Dean Tricarico has been working at Shiru Cafe in Providence for about six months. “I’ve definitely seen business grow,” he said. A larger part of his job description includes “creating more of a professional environment,” he said, which for many students means simply a good place to do homework. “The ultimate goal is to just enhance the next generation that is coming into the workforce,” Tricarico added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Students have asked questions about data collection and the corporate focus of Shiru Cafe’s business model. “When we first opened, there was a lot of skepticism” from students about a company that asks for their data, Tricarico said. “When you register with us, I really like to describe it as you’re just filling out a kind of sample resume,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even as Shiru cafes in the United States work toward offering professional opportunities, the Providence cafe continues to prioritize providing quality space and beverages to its community. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The cafe is “definitely customized to the American coffee culture,” Maher said. The convenience of free coffee and the workspace draws even those students who harbor reservations about the corporate ethos of Shiru Cafe. “Our coffee is such an important part of what we do; our business has to do with students first,” Strobing said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our goal is definitely to be able to contribute positively to the Providence community and to the Brown University community,” Maher said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While she enjoys the beverages and in particular the study environment, Shiru regular Allison Meakem ’20 remains uncertain about Shiru Cafe’s business model.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I do think we should be a little skeptical,” Meakem said. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch and here there’s no such thing as a free coffee.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Business, academic leaders team up to address climate change in Rhode Island</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Providence business leaders joined the Rhode Island academic community Jan. 15 and 16 for the “Providence Resiliency Workshop,” an event hosted at the University and designed to highlight the challenges climate change presents for Providence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The conference was primarily geared<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>toward conveying the latest climate change data to the business community and civic leaders, as opposed to coming up with new data or outlining a plan, according to event organizer and Director of WaterFire Barnaby Evans. “(University of Rhode Island) and Brown have been researching this since the ‘70s and have been very articulate (about)what the challenges are,” Evans said. But the business community was not necessarily aware of all of this research, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">75 participants — including representatives from the University, other academic institutions in-state, CVS and Bank of America — attended the workshop Tuesday evening. The intention was to “spark interest in the scope of the issues and put it in a Providence context,” said Curt Spalding, professor of the practice of environment and society and an event organizer. For example, Evans hoped the workshop would clarify that Providence’s hurricane barrier, while effective in the short term for mitigating storm surges, is not a long-term solution for sea level rise. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Presentations regarding the potential risks of flooding and sea level rise in Providence sparked both dismay and energy. “There’s a sense of disability about this challenge in Rhode Island, at least in Providence,” Spalding said. Evans added that some attendees were unaware of the immediacy of the effects of climate change in Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Feelings of intimidation were ultimately joined by an enthusiasm for engagement. “There was a sense that there should be an organization that keeps this going, there was a lot of willingness to help each other,” said Anne Tate, professor of architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design. Spalding stressed that it is not enough to think about physical resilience, such as strengthening hurricane barriers; community members must also consider the social resilience of communities and the higher instances of “social stress” that will likely be caused by climate events. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tate believes Providence is uniquely situated to address sea level rise and other impending environmental changes. While Rhode Island is “at as much risk as any other city when it comes to sea level rise, … we have an unusual collection of academic resources,” Tate said. This includes the “world-class” Marine Science Research Facility at the University of Rhode Island, “the creative input of RISD and the solid research backing from Brown,” as well as work done by Johnson &amp; Wales University and other institutions, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We feel like if we can lever these assets, Rhode Island and Providence can play a leading role in putting forward what are the imaginative and progressive ways to deal with climate change and sea level rise,” Tate said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">To foster a more participatory process, attendees broke out into small discussion groups centered on various issues such as health and wellness, communications and outreach and leadership and infrastructure. They then wrote down the challenges and opportunities posed by climate crisis, followed by a discussion about potential short-term and long-term solutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These ideas were collected by the event’s organizers and will be further evaluated in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Organizers designed the discussion sections to encourage constructive conversations that were not “all about the problems” and “not all about what somebody else should do,” Tate said. Instead, they focused on how individuals can get involved in preparing Providence for climate change and the resources they need to do so. In one case, an attendee expressed they were “willing to generate a discussion in (their) business,” about climate resiliency, but they “need help organizing that,” Tate said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Organizers hope that eventually there will be some concrete commitments to put the resources together to work alongside state and municipal government efforts to address climate change. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The effects of climate change will be felt “sooner than one hundred years” from now, Evans said. “We should start preparing for them now.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>R.I. Senate considers shutdown relief bills</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Thirty two days and one missed paycheck<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>into the longest shutdown in the federal government’s history, the Rhode Island Senate Judiciary Committee convened Tuesday to discuss measures to protect furloughed federal employees.</p>
<p class="p2">The committee, chaired by state Sen. Erin Lynch Prata (D-Warwick), devoted its first meeting to discussing the financial security of affected Rhode Islanders. The proposed Federal Furloughed Employees Protection Act, sponsored by state Sen. Dawn Euer (D-Newport, Jamestown), would provide unpaid federal employees such as Transportation and Security Administration agents and <span class="s1">Coast Guard employees with reprieve from tax, residential, credit card and automotive payments. The legislation also suggests a “stay or postponement of all civil proceedings in district or superior court” for all furloughed employees. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The implementation of this legislation will “help the families who are impacted by (the shutdown), to ease their minds. I know that almost 80 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck and that these families have already missed one paycheck,” Euer told The Herald. She explained that the legislation aims to lighten the burden on these families, as they “juggle payments, make the decision between the car payment and the medication payment, between paying your mortgag</span>e and paying your credit card,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">Durin<span class="s2">g the hearing, Euer emphasized urgency, as it is unclear when the shutdown will end. “Missing one paycheck is a problem, missing two is disastrous,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“The majority of senators signed on to the legislation. I know that folks are very supportive of the idea,” Euer told The Herald, adding that she hopes the Senate will vote on the bill Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The bill is primarily a response to outcry from Rhode Island cities and towns, which have asked the state to help their residents weather the shutdown, according to a <a href="http://www.rilegislature.gov/pressrelease/_layouts/RIL.PressRelease.ListStructure/Forms/DisplayForm.aspx?List=c8baae31-3c10-431c-8dcd-9dbbe21ce3e9&amp;ID=51607&amp;randId=0.20548206749774667">press release</a> from the Rhode Island General Assembly. A study by WalletHub currently ranks Rhode Island as the state 11th <a href="https://www.golocalprov.com/politics/ri-ranked-one-of-states-most-affected-by-government-shutdown">most affected</a> by the government shutdown. The study ranked states according to factors such as state share of federal jobs, federal contract dollars per capita and the percentage of families receiving food stamps, among other factors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Euer said she would like to include an amendment addressing furloughed employees’ student loan payments, which could also be affected by missed paychecks.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Another bill called The Levy and Assessment of Local Taxes bill, sponsored by state Sen. William Conley Jr. (D-East Providence), is being considered concurrently. Conley’s bill applies to Rhode Island residents employed by the federal government and takes effect during government shutdowns. His bill allows city or town councils to “provide relief from the payment of any tax due or payable to the city or town tax...upon real estate or tangible property.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“If you fail to pay a quarter of your property tax, probably across this whole state, the cities and towns charge 18 percent (interest) for even missing one day. That’s a huge amount,” state Sen. Leonidas P. Raptakis (D-Coventry) said during the committee meeting. Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island Steven Brown said state and town fees and taxes should be postponed for affected residents, also citing harsh late penalties, such as the mandatory suspension of a person’s driver’s license after a missed fee payment.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The Rhode Island branch of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations “very strongly supports this legislation,” said George Nee, the organization’s president. Nee also noted that unemployment insurance is unavailable for furloughed employees, who are technically still working.</p>
<p class="p2">“They’re protecting us and are being mistreated” he said, “(The bill is) terrific, but awful that we have to have a bill for this.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Legislators introduce Reproductive Health Care Act</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2019/01/24/reproductive-health-care-act/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Sen. Gayle Goldin, D-Providence, and State Rep. Edith Ajello, D-Providence, filed the Reproductive Health Care Act — which would codify the legality of abortion into state law —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for the third year in a row on Jan. 15. Currently, the Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade legalizes abortion at the federal level, leaving the right to abortion unprotected in Rhode Island if the case were to be overturned, according to Goldin and Ajello.</p>
<p class="p2">Gov. Gina Raimondo voiced her support for the bill, stating on her Twitter this summer that “it’s now more urgent than ever that the legislature pass the Reproductive Health Care Act.” The Womxn Project, a non-profit organization working for rights for female-identifying Rhode Islanders, held a rally on Wednesday in support of the bill’s launch.</p>
<p class="p2">Concerns about the overturning of Roe v. Wade were raised with the election of President Trump and the appointment of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, according to a State of Rhode Island General Assembly <a href="http://www.rilegislature.gov/pressrelease/_layouts/RIL.PressRelease.ListStructure/Forms/DisplayForm.aspx?List=c8baae31-3c10-431c-8dcd-9dbbe21ce3e9&amp;ID=51540" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>. Currently, Rhode Island has some of the most regressive abortion laws in the country, more akin to southern states than its northeastern neighbors, according to Goldin and Ajello. Rhode Island has previously received an F rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America. Roe v. Wade is the only statute preventing the enforcement of restrictive abortion laws in Rhode Island. Such laws include<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>requiring a woman’s spouse to consent to her having an abortion or defining life to legally begin at conception, according to Goldin and Ajello. The Reproductive Health Care Act would strike these down.</p>
<p class="p2">The Act would not change anything about the current state of abortion access or legality in Rhode Island. “It takes what’s legal in federal and state case law and puts it into state law,” Goldin said. She also added that the bill would not change how abortion is funded in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p2">Rhode Island’s status as a Democrat-leaning state with regressive abortion laws is largely due to the strength of the Catholic Church, according to Goldin and Ajello. “The largest impediment to this bill’s passage is the Catholic Church,” Goldin said. “The Catholic Church has a lobbyist up at the state house every day; I don’t think people realize that.”</p>
<p class="p2">The Catholic Church has also used its influence in the past to enact punitive measures against Catholic legislators who openly support reproductive rights, Goldin said. “They have certainly excommunicated people in the state for being leaders of reproductive rights,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>she added.</p>
<p class="p2">In the past two years, the bill has been unable to garner the support needed to come to a vote. House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, D-Cranston, spoke last year on his belief that the issue is irrelevant since the Supreme Court has not yet taken action to overturn Roe v. Wade, The Providence Journal reported. “I just remind folks that this is a very divisive issue on both sides. And you know, it is an issue that would utilize all of the oxygen in the room,” Mattiello said.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It also may be against the interests of some legislators to vote on the bill, as it could reveal discrepancies between their personal opinions and those of their constituents, according to Goldin. Seventy-one percent of Rhode Islanders expressed their support for the bill to protect abortion access, according to the press release. For the Senate, there are people who “would probably prefer not to actually vote at all,” Goldin said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">But supporters are “cautiously optimistic” about the bill’s chances this year, said Maeve Wiesen ’21, president of NARAL at Brown. Ajello also voiced her hopes for this legislative session. “What’s different in recent years is that more and more pro-reproductive freedom and reproductive privacy legislators have been elected in Rhode Island,” Ajello said. “There’s been a steady gain over the years of more and more pro-choice legislators.” The bill has 39 sponsors in the House and 17 in the Senate this year, a record number in comparison to the previous two years it’s been introduced, <a href="https://www.wpri.com/politics/two-abortion-rights-bills-introduced-in-rhode-island/1706784477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPRI previously reported.</a></p>
<p class="p2">Student groups, such as NARAL at Brown and the University’s chapter of the ACLU, have supported the bill in the past and are working again this year to aid in the bill’s passage, according to Wiesen and Liam Greenwell ’20 of the ACLU.</p>
<p class="p2">Wiesen said that NARAL and other Brown-affiliated organizations are “trying to work with other groups that are mostly Rhode Island residents” since many University students do not live in Providence and aren’t registered to vote in Rhode Island. Last year, Wiesen provided childcare for Rhode Island citizens while they testified in support of the bill.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Greenwell said that one thing University students can do to support this bill is let Rhode Islanders “take the lead, and see what they need to help pass these things.” The state of reproductive rights in Rhode Island still affects many University students, Greenwell said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“A lot of people do take for granted that Rhode Island is a bastion of reproductive rights, but it’s not,” Greenwell said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a $9.9 billion state <a href="http://www.omb.ri.gov/budget/prioryear/operating/2020.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget plan</a> released last Thursday, Gov. Gina Raimondo proposed to legalize recreational adult-use marijuana. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Taxes from medical and recreational marijuana constitute $6.5 million of the planned budget. Long opposed to legalizing marijuana, Raimondo has now changed her position. “I have some reluctance about it. But I think we can’t not do it with Massachusetts and Connecticut coming online. Like it or not, it’s here,” Raimondo told <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/01/17/governor-propose-marijuana-legalization-neighboring-states-launch-programs-like-not-here/bFob5ipcLUgJY8cd59GfyH/story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Boston Globe</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last Sunday, a recreational marijuana retail store opened in Fall River, Mass., just several hundred feet from the border with Rhode Island, according to <a href="http://www.heraldnews.com/news/20190120/spirits-high-at-fall-river-pot-shops-opening-day-for-recreational-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fall River’s Herald News</a>. “That means that it’s going to be sold to Rhode Islanders,” State Rep. Edith Ajello, D-Providence, told The Herald. “Whatever problems are associated with that sale to Rhode Islanders, Rhode Island’s not going to collect any other taxes” which could remediate those issues, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">State legislators will take months to finalize the state’s fiscal year 2020 budget. If the proposal to legalize marijuana moves forward, legislators will take even more time to fine-tune the details of legalization. For developing policy, “it would make sense to somewhat follow Massachusetts’ lead since they are right over the border,” Ajello said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With legalization, “the profitability would go out of the sale of marijuana for drug dealers,” Ajello said, adding, “the drug market would dry up. And I think that’s the way we more successfully keep marijuana and other drugs away from kids.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Associate Professor of Behavioral and Social Sciences and of Psychiatry and Human Behavior Jane Metrik studies the behavioral economics of marijuana use. Her research, recently published in the scientific journal “Addiction,” suggests that marijuana users “treat legal cannabis as a superior commodity compared to illegal cannabis as long as the price of the legal product is not too high.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Pricing policy (including taxation) will need to be optimized in order to avoid users switching to illegal markets and to allow for proper regulation of a legal marketplace,” Metrik wrote in an email to The Herald. “Legalization of marijuana will certainly ... contribute to increases in marijuana use and misuse among youth,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The impact of legalization could vary by community. In states that have legalized marijuana, “retail stores are often concentrated in neighborhoods that are socio-economically disadvantaged,” Metrik wrote. “Therefore, one unintended consequence of state-wide legalization could be an increase in cannabis use in marginalized groups due to variability in regulations across local communities and bans on retail operations in more affluent neighborhoods.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the debate continues in Rhode Island, the University does not plan to change its policies on marijuana use because it receives federal funding and must abide by federal laws. “We anticipate no significant shift in Brown policy — regardless of whether state law changes, marijuana remains illegal under federal law,” wrote Director of News and Editorial Development Brian Clark in an email to The Herald. “Even if state law changes, Brown expects to continue to prohibit illicit drug activity, including marijuana use, by students, on our campus or as part of any Brown activity.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Government shutdown impacts Rhode Island Coast Guard families</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today marks the 35th day of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history and the second missed paycheck for Coast Guard workers in Rhode Island, who are required to show up to work despite their lack of compensation.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The Coast Guard has approximately 332 active duty and reserve personnel in Rhode Island, according to Petty Officer Andrew Barresi. While some civilian employees are furloughed during the government shutdown, active duty and reserve members are not. The Coast Guard will continue to provide essential services, including “search and rescue, port and homeland safety and security, law enforcement and environmental response,” Barresi wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite these continued operations, “they will likely not have the full support that they need in order to maintain mission readiness,” Barresi wrote, adding “as far as water safety goes, Coast Guard units in Rhode Island will continue to perform missions that protect life and property.”</p>
<p class="p2">Many of the Rhode Island Coast Guard members who are working to keep the coast safe are struggling to make ends meet. Mariah Battermann is a Coast Guard spouse and stay-at-home mother of two young children in Middletown. She is also, like many of her peers, facing the ramifications of the shutdown.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s definitely got us making some different choices,” Battermann said. “I’m not used to really having to pay much attention to when I go grocery shopping. If I want to get something, I usually just get it … so now that has changed a little bit for us, and we’ve had to make some big cut backs like (not) going out to eat, no stopping at McDonald’s for the kids.”</p>
<p class="p2">According to Battermann, a lot of other Coast Guard families in the area have also been forced to make hard choices in light of the shutdown —which has no clear end in sight. Rachel Malcom Brown, another Rhode Island Coast Guard spouse and stay-at-home mother of four girls, faces similar difficulties.</p>
<p class="p2">To weather the financial burdens of the shutdown, Malcom Brown and her family have cut down on groceries and called bill collectors in order to defer payments.</p>
<p class="p2">“(We’re) making sure that we’re utilizing the food that we have here – trying to make everything last as long as we can,” Malcom Brown said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is the first time a government shutdown has affected Battermann and Malcom Brown’s families, they said.</p>
<p class="p2">Some families affected by the shutdown have come together to support each other as their financial security is threatened. Malcom Brown reached out on Facebook to others in her position to offer what she could: “a warm meal, or a friend.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After receiving an overwhelming response from families in need and those eager to help, Malcom Brown called her friend, Battermann. Together, the two launched the Be The Light Drive of Rhode Island, an initiative to provide food and other necessities to families affected by the shutdown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Sunday, Be The Light Drive hosted a potluck dinner at OceanPointe Church in Middletown. The group provided food donated by local restaurants, household goods and pantry items to families impacted by the partial shutdown. They also handed out brochures listing local organizations that can provide assistance to those directly affected by the shutdown and created a sign-up sheet for specific needs. According to Battermann, this event served 61 families.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The community really chipped in and we all came together,” Malcom Brown said. “I started getting messages from everyone in the community, saying, ‘What donations do you need? What can I bring? What can I do?’”</span></p>
<p class="p2">“It was 100 percent a community effort,” Battermann agreed. “It was touching and heartwarming and just overwhelming.” According to Battermann, some community members who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits approached the organizers asking what they could buy to donate to the drive. “The only word for that is ‘wow,’” Battermann said, “because you’re looking at people who don’t know where their next meal’s gonna come from, and they’re willing to help us.”</p>
<p class="p2">Even Malcom Brown’s six-year-old daughter pitched in, spending her birthday preparing for the potluck dinner. “We had that conversation with her about what we were doing and how we were gonna help people like us.” Malcolm Brown said. “I think that she enjoyed giving back.”</p>
<p class="p2">Battermann and Malcom Brown are now working to secure a building for a pop-up pantry. They hope to have it up and running before this weekend, and plan to keep it open as long as the shutdown continues.</p>
<p class="p2">Both of the community organizers remain uncertain but “hopeful” that legislatures will “find a solution soon,” but they are “in the meantime, … just trying to trudge ahead,” Batterman said.</p>
<p class="p2">For now, Battermann and Malcom Brown are focused on the support of their community.</p>
<p class="p2">“When you get lost in the negativity like on the news, you forget that there are people (whose) hearts are in the right place,” Malcom Brown said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Old fur coats with faded fabric lie piled next to brass lamps and boxes of cracked, yellowed vinyl slips. A worn </span><span class="s1">teddy bear and an ancient film camera appeared to stare at first-edition comic books on folding card tables. This is a flea market — a monument to those fascinated by the eclectic, the odd and the creative.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the winter months, the Providence Flea Market makes its home in Hope High School’s gymnasium. Maria Tocco, who founded the Flea in 2013, was inspired by the Brooklyn Flea Market. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I had been visiting (Brooklyn) thinking, ‘Wow, this is really cool, why isn’t there something like this in Providence?’” Tocco said. She started the market as a side-gig while she worked as the communications director for Rhode Island Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was amazing how the community really embraced it. … We had about 30 vendors on the first market, and from there it started to grow. … Now we average around 55-60 for the holiday markets,” Tocco said. The market has had 500 vendors attend various sessions since last summer. Food trucks, live music and non-profits, such as the University’s knitting club, Tink Knit, also attend, Tocco said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We want to provide a community market,” she said, explaining that vendors and customers become friends through the event. Pointing at two vintage stalls, Tocco said that the two vendors had met at the Flea.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They’ve become really good buddies, they go to Boston (and) do research on their vintage finds together,” she said, adding that they also travel together to Brimfield, Massachussetts, the home of the oldest flea market in the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tocco said that the Flea not only provides community, it also embraces “the upcycle, recycle, reuse mantra,” and pairs that with “makers and artisans who are doing handmade stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the future, Tocco hopes to find a permanent year-round location for the market, which would allow the Flea to host workshops and sell alcohol. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She also expressed interest in increasing engagement with the University: “If there are other nonprofits that are interested in getting exposure, we are open to hosting them, interested in helping them out. I’d love to do a flea at Brown, that would be really fun.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Vendors go through an application process before they can open shop at the market. Tocco gauges whether potential stalls will fit in with existing vendors and assesses their products. Vendors at the Flea cannot be “multi-level marketing organizations,” she said, as the Flea is intended exclusively for artisans. Many vendors consistently return to the Flea, which has a regular cast of characters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bill Foley owns and operates Foley’s Finds and has participated in the Flea for about eight years. Foley taught high school history and English for forty years in R.I., while pursuing antiquing on the side. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I love trying to find (items), I love dealing with the people and selling,” he said. “I have an eclectic mix, … I have boxes, I have historical paper, pretty much the whole gamut. Old books.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He took out a dark green box labeled with military stencil font. Inside were tools for stamping metal. “This is from WWI, one of the things they’d mark is dog tags. And this is authentic and actually used,” Foley said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Johnny Maguire, owner of Colonel’s Collectibles, also did not always intend to be a vintage item dealer. “I was a guitar player, I played in a band that did well. I always liked collecting things. I didn’t start with all of this: the art, the comics, the records,” Maguire said. His old band played “rockabilly, kinda old rock and roll stuff. … That started to slow down, and I started to get into this.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Maguire acknowledged the sense of community offered by the Flea, saying most of his friends were “vintage people.” “I know a lot of people that make things and jewelry, but they come and go. But the regulars, … we all stick together. (Tocco’s) trying to do a good thing. I like doing it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the regulars, Jennifer Tradd, sells vintage clothing and antiques at her stall, House of Philippa. “We love (the Providence Flea). Providence is a great town. We love the students. They’re great. Just because they know what’s on the cutting edge of what’s cool right now, and I try to keep up with it as best I can. We also get people, all walks of life from Providence.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Former Herald reporter Tanushri Sundar ‘21 and Jasmine Gabor ‘21 were among Sunday’s most recent market crowd. “I really like it, it’s a really charming place. There’s one stand over there that’s really freaky, it has dolls and like surgical tools, which I think is interesting,” Sundar said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gabor said she often finds items “a lot cooler than anything you can find in a store” at the Flea, which she described as a “cute, vintage market, with a mixture of vintage items and local artists.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhode Island School of Design graduate Laurelin Sitterly produces art about plants and animals at risk and uses the Flea to showcase and sell her work. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sitterly described Providence as “a very eclectic community. … So many people just doing their thing, a lot of different cultures mixed in. Kind of a vibe that really supports trying to push up small businesses, support the quirky and the odd, all of that, you know, the great weird.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The next Providence Flea Market will be held at Hope High School, at 324 Hope St., Feb. 10, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Government shutdown delays public hearings on Vineyard Wind project</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite the partial federal government shutdown ending, public comment meetings led by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management regarding Vineyard Wind’s plan to construct an offshore wind-turbine farm have been indefinitely postponed, according to David Bernhardt, acting secretary of the interior.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Meetings were scheduled Jan. 8, 9, 15, 16 and 17 but were continually pushed back as the government shutdown extended and BOEM workers were forced to stay home. Bernhardt tweeted Jan. 24 that BOEM would “reschedule public meetings for the Vineyard Wind offshore renewable project very soon,” but gave no timeline on the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the delay in public comment meetings, “construction activities on the site will begin by the end of this year” if all permits are secured, Vineyard Wind spokesman Scott Farmelant said. “Every single permit is expected to be getting in by the end of the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter,” he added. Vineyard Wind has a tax credit from the federal government should they begin building in 2019, so the timeline for construction is crucial. “They’re eligible for 12 percent tax credit if they begin construction this year,” Farmelant said. “That program is expiring as of right now.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Vineyard Wind is confident the project will remain on schedule despite the effects of the shutdown, Farmelant said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">BOEM requires that offshore wind companies hold public comment meetings in Rhode Island because it impacts economic activities such as fishing, <a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190117/vineyard-wind-offers-62m-to-compensate-ri-fishermen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to The Providence Journal</a>. But with the delay of these public meetings, many local fishermen feel as though they have lost out on the opportunity to voice their opinions on the issue, according to Greg Mataronas, a R.I.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>fisherman. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though an online commenting portal was open on BOEM’s website until Jan. 22, where fishermen could write up formal comments expressing their concerns, Mataronas finds the in-person meetings to be much more useful. “A lot of times you get guys into the room that don’t necessarily have the time or the capacity to be writing formal, written comments into BOEM,” Mataronas said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many fishermen are unhappy with the pace of the project. Regarding BOEM’s role specifically, “they haven’t done a great job with this process at all,” Mataronas said. “As a fisherman, it just feels rushed.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fisherman are concerned that the construction of the wind farm would render the area unfishable, Mataronas said. They fear that there will not be enough space in between the turbines, and that the project is dependent on old data that could prove inaccurate, and therefore damaging toecosystems. “There’s not a lot of actual, physical, current research being applied in the areas that they’re looking at developing in,” Mataronas said. “A lot of it is not sufficient for knowing the effects of the wind farm once it’s put up.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These public comment meetings are also important for fishermen because Vineyard Wind has already suggested their project may decrease access for fishermen to their usual fishing grounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To compensate, Vineyard Wind offered $6.2 million to fishermen for this lost access Jan. 17, <a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190117/vineyard-wind-offers-62m-to-compensate-ri-fishermen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Providence Journal</a>. BOEM also reduced the original amount of sea they were considering for lease to wind farm companies by 60 percent due to fishing concerns, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/25/offshore-wind-farms-concern-fisherpeople/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Without the public comment meetings and BOEM as an intermediary, Mataronas has found communication with Vineyard Wind difficult. “As far as meaningful talks, there hasn’t been a whole lot of that past few months,” Mataronas said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Vineyard Wind was “selected by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to build an 800 megawatt offshore wind farm,” R.I. has its own interest in seeing Vineyard Wind completed as a large-scale offshore wind project, said Nick Ucci, deputy commissioner of energy of the R.I. Office of Energy Resources. Rhode Island is looking into projects of its own that would help meet the energy goals set by Gov. Gina Raimondo in 2017, aiming at achieving 1,000 megawatts of clean energy by 2020. While Vineyard Wind’s clean electricity won’t add to this goal, since it will be connected to Massachussett’s power grid, the permit process would help pave the way for ensuing projects in Rhode Island, Ucci said.</span></p>
<em><strong>Clarification: </strong></em><em><strong>An earlier version this article ran with the headline "Government shutdown delays meetings between fishermen, Vineyard Wind." While the shutdown did delay public hearings — which allowed for comments by all members of the public, including fishermen — fishermen and Vineyard Winds were permitted to meet independently in that window. Therefore, the headline, "Government shutdown delays public hearings on Vineyard Wind project"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is more accurate. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following Rhode Island’s legalization of sports betting last June, state politicians joined casino representatives Monday to discuss updates and challenges posed by the implementation of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sports betting and assess the financial state of the casinos. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">New sports betting facilities were added to the state’s two major casinos — the Twin River and Tiverton Casino Hotel — in November and December of last year, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/26/legal-sports-betting-begins-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously reported</a>. Rhode Island is the only state in New England to offer sports betting. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The attendees at the meeting were primarily concerned with shortening wait times for placing bets. These waits can be “up to an hour” at Tiverton during conference games, which minimizes the casino’s opportunity to increase their betting revenue, said Joe Moore, Tiverton Casino Hotel General Manager. Both casinos hope to decrease the wait times by hiring more staff and adding additional tills and kiosks, he added. The casinos also aim to launch a mobile on-site app by end of June. In conjunction with more kiosks, the app will allow people to place bets faster without waiting in long lines. The casino representatives also see potential for these tactics to mitigate large crowds during upcoming popular events like the Super Bowl and March Madness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the lines cause logistical problems, they demonstrate “pent-up demand” for sports betting, said Paul Grimaldi, public information officer for the Department of Revenue. “The easier we make it, the more likely it will generate more income,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From attendees at the meeting, there was a sense of general optimism and support for sports betting and its impact on the state as a whole and the cities surrounding the casinos. “I don’t think traffic has increased, I haven’t heard of any problems from my constituents or anybody else in the area,” Sen. Thomas J. Paolino , D-Lincoln, North Providence, North Smithfield, said. “It seems to be a win-win right now for everybody.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But it is difficult to determine how much R. I. is currently profiting from sports betting, Grimaldi said. As of last December, sports betting book revenue was $957,913, according to the Rhode Island lottery’s fiscal year <a href="https://www.rilot.com/content/dam/interactive/ilottery/pdfs/financial/SportsBookSummaryFY2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 report</a>. Even so, the long-term impact of sports betting in the state is still unknown. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If (citizens)take a dollar that they were going to spend on the movies, or out to dinner somewhere, and they come here and bet on sports, is the state of Rhode Island necessarily better off?” Grimaldi added. It will likely be a year before “we see if all those phases work out.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nationally, the legalization of sports betting incites fears of increased cases of gambling addiction, according to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2018-05-19/expanded-sports-betting-fuels-fears-about-gambling-addiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US News</a>. However, Rhode Island casinos are attempting to tackle this health concern. “Twin River has a long established partnership with a mental health consortium here in Rhode Island,” Grimaldi said. He added that the casino currently pays $125,000 a year for counselors and counseling sessions for people with gambling problems. “Like everything else we’ll keep an eye on things and if we think we need to devote more resources to it we will,” Grimaldi said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Providence City Committee on Ordinances voted Jan. 29 to “continue indefinitely” a previously proposed amendment which would have restricted housing to no more than four undergraduate students per home across the city.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The ruling “kind of kills” the amendment, said Tina Mastroianni, first deputy city clerk. “(The committee) can’t take it up again.”</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://providenceri.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&amp;MeetingID=11565&amp;MediaPosition=&amp;ID=20079&amp;CssClass=">The amendment</a> had been introduced in July 2018 by councilman Seth Yurdin and Samuel Zurier, adding language that would restrict more than four undergraduates from living together in two-family, multi-family and various other types of homes.</p>
<p class="p2">Yurdin later withdrew his support out of concern that the amendment discriminated against students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A law that reduces the scope of discrimination, but still allows it to apply to others is not acceptable,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="p2">A previous housing ordinance amendment that was passed by City Council in 2015 limited the number of college students per single-family home to three, whereas the amendment discussed Tuesday would limit the number to four in various types of homes, such as multi-family. The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island later challenged the 2015 amendment in the Rhode Island Superior Court, <a href="https://www.golocalprov.com/news/ri-aclu-appeals-court-ruling-in-prov-student-housing-case">which upheld the ordinance</a>. Following that decision, the ACLU of Rhode Island <a href="http://www.riaclu.org/news/post/aclu-appeals-court-ruling-in-providence-student-housing-case">appealed the case</a> to the Rhode Island Supreme Court, where it is awaiting a decision on whether it will be heard.</p>
<p class="p2">The amendment was initially proposed after many homeowners living in neighborhoods surrounding the University’s campus pushed for student housing limitations. Spurred by complaints of disruptive parties, concerns about rising housing costs and a desire to preserve “neighborhood character,” residents began a campaign in support of more extensive zoning rules, <a href="https://www.theindy.org/1463">according to The College Hill Independent</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Robert Azar, deputy director of the City Plan Commission, advised that the amendment is “superfluous” due to a third ordinance that has yet to be heard by the Committee.</p>
<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Robert Azar, deputy director of the City Plan Commission, advised that the amendment is “superfluous” due to the ordinance currently awaiting hearing in the Rhode Island Supreme Court. In fact, Azar advised that the amendment is “superfluous” due to a third ordinance that has yet to be heard by the Committee. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Reproductive rights take center stage at State House</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Five bills regarding abortion were heard by the Rhode Island House Judiciary Committee Tuesday night, and over 100 activists filled the State House halls to support or oppose the bills.</p>
<p class="p2">Should the U.S. Supreme Court ever overturn Roe v. Wade, the Reproductive Health Care Act (H 5127) would codify protections set forth in Roe v. Wade at the state level. In her testimony, Rep. Edith Ajello, D-Providence, one of the bill’s lead sponsors, argued that the RHCA would maintain the current status quo as exists under Roe v. Wade in the state. Both Providence and Central Falls city councils affirmed their support for the RHCA in resolutions this past week, which were distributed at the State House Tuesday night. This hearing marks the third year that state legislatures have filed the RHCA, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2019/01/24/reproductive-health-care-act/">The Herald previously reported</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Another bill heard Tuesday, the Reproductive Privacy Act, is similar to the RHCA but does not repeal existing state abortion restrictions that currently do not align with federal law. The other propositions are not in favor of codifying Roe v. Wade in the state — the R.I. Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act, the Right to Life Act of 2019 and a resolution “recognizing the fetus as a human life upon the existence of a heartbeat.”</p>
<p class="p2">An hour before testimonies began, the hearing room filled to capacity, and overflow rooms quickly became crowded. Signs with Planned Parenthood or pro-life slogans flew overhead. Around 5:00 p.m., a chant of “Life!” broke out for several minutes. At least three priests of the Catholic Church stood in the halls. In the hearing room, those seated held signs, and one Make America Great Again hat could be seen.</p>
<p class="p2">“I don’t understand how people can rationalize it,” said Providence resident David Gillis, a self-proclaimed devout Roman Catholic and pro-life supporter. Deploring the “loss of human potential,” Gillis added, “You can’t take somebody’s life because it’s inconvenient for you.” In the hearing room, certain witnesses’ testimonies were met with “Amen” and applause.</p>
<p class="p2">One witness, former R.I. State Representative Linda Kushner, recounted nearly dying after getting an illegal abortion 60 years ago. “I don’t want any woman to go through what I had to go through,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">“When abortion is restricted, (women) are forced outside the medical system,” said Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology Benjamin Brown ’08 MD ’12.</p>
<p class="p2">While many came to testify and support their positions, the future of these bills remain unclear as states across the nation contest abortion legislation.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’ve been seeing really restrictive abortion bans in states like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/health/ohio-abortion-ban-heartbeat-bill.html">Ohio</a>. …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And a lot of these types of things some people are saying are kind of bait or could be used to bring things up to the Supreme Court,” said Maeve Wiesen ’21, president of the Brown chapter of NARAL Pro-Choice America.</p>
<p class="p2">Wiesen was joined by Ben Lipson ’22, political director of the Brown Democrats, and Liam Greenwell ’20, treasurer of the Brown chapter of the ACLU, who said they support the RHCA and oppose the four other bills. They planned to testify Tuesday but left the State House before they were able to deliver their addresses, citing a backlog of other witness testimonies as the reason for their departure. Greenwell and Celia Story ’19 have been concerned about reproductive rights in the state since last April, when they wrote an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/16/story-19greenwell-20-students-must-fight-for-reproductive-rights-in-r-i">op-ed</a> in The Herald positing that repealing Roe v. Wade would pose a serious risk to abortion access in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p2">Six University students accompanied the representatives of the Brown ACLU, Brown Dems and Brown NARAL to the hearing. “I think that a lot of people have assumptions about what it means to be going to school in New England and in a state that is blue. In my experience a lot of people just haven’t thought that this is an issue here,” Wiesen said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>TSA reflects on support during government shutdown</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Rhode Island Transportation Security Administration workers made it through a tough holiday season at Theodore Francis Green International Airport thanks to high employee attendance and community support.</p>
<p class="p4">The partial government shutdown ended Jan. 25, and federal workers receive back pay this week, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/heres-what-furloughed-employees-should-know-about-their-back-pay/2019/01/29/69a3c70e-23e1-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f0f5b27dee10">the Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p class="p4">“I am extremely proud of how (our TSA) employees responded (to the shutdown),” said R.I. TSA Federal Security Director Daniel Burche.</p>
<p class="p4">Burche described the airport’s function during the shutdown as “operationally normal,” explaining that work attendance was higher than he experienced in past holiday seasons.</p>
<p class="p4">“With maybe one exception, I had less call-outs than I would have normally expected. … We had people coming in for work who were literally so sick we asked them to go home,” Burche said.</p>
<p class="p4">The community rallied in support of TSA workers during the partial shutdown, when they had to work without pay, according to Burche.</p>
<p class="p4">Workers received “tremendous public support,” including gifts of baby formula and diapers, assistance from public utilities and banks and surprise pizza deliveries, Burche said.</p>
<p class="p4">“All of that recognition goes a long way to helping people stay focused on the job and not worry about anything,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">If a deal to end the partial government shutdown had not been reached, Burche worried the negative impact on workers would have been worse: “In the grand scheme of things, we’re paid to keep an eye on the ball. External stress, or unnecessary stress is certainly nothing that I want to see.”</p>
<p class="p4">While the shutdown has ended temporarily, its magnitude has brought attention to the widespread effects of government closure. Before Congress and President Donald Trump agreed to reopen the government, many federal workers, including TSA officials, struggled to make ends meet.</p>
<p class="p4">“The impact (of the shutdown) is a majority of Federal officers had to go to food banks to get food to put on the table, to support not only themselves but their families and children,” said Paul Feragne, president of the local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, which covers parts of New England and represents federal workers at T.F. Green. He added that other sources of stress during the shutdown included fears of health insurance cancellations, eviction and missing payments on their credit cards, loans and cars.</p>
<p class="p4">Elected officials also sympathized with the unpaid TSA employees at T.F. Green.</p>
<p class="p4">“They’re angry,” Rep. David Cicilline (D-1) wrote in an email to The Herald. “This took a toll on them. None of us would want our boss to tell us to show up for work for 35 days without a paycheck. These are working people who have bills to pay.”</p>
<p class="p4">Cicilline wrote there was “no question” the shutdown had a potential impact on airport security. “None of us are safer because an air traffic controller is distracted by the thought that he can’t pay rent. We’re all more at risk when a TSA worker is worried about her credit bill while she’s supposed to be screening passengers,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">For the future, Cicilline wrote that he plans to co-sponsor legislation to avoid a similar situation.</p>
<p class="p4">Despite the hardships faced by TSA workers, the shutdown may have created a greater appreciation for what they do.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’ve probably been thanked more in the last 35 days than in the past 15 years,” Burche said.</p>]]></content:encoded>
