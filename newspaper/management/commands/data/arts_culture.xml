		<title>Professor Wang Lu honored by WQXR Radio</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When music touches on the real-world implications of cultural heritage, the environment and popular culture, people are sure to notice. And they have — WQXR Radio in New York City included the work of Assistant Professor of Music Wang Lu among the “Top New Music-Moments of 2016.­” The list aimed to celebrate “some of the most uplifting, imagination-gripping and breathtaking musical achievements of the past year,” according to the radio station’s website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to many other honors, Wang is a 2014 Guggenheim Fellow and the recipient of two ASCAP Morton Gould Awards. “She seems to be blowing up now,” said Ian MacDougald ’17, who has taken three classes with Wang and is currently her thesis advisee. Despite her recent honors, Wang said she cares more about composing itself than the titles. I’ve “just got to write the music, whether I’m on the list or not.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When Wang was growing up in the 1980s, a period of economic reform in China, families would come together to buy a piano, she said. Many saw the investment as a sign of a cultured life at home. “It’s an escape, it’s a fantasy, it’s moving forward,” Wang said. She, like many of her childhood friends, played piano from a young age. She began training at five, studying a strict Western repertoire focusing primarily on French and Russian works. Early in her adolescence, she began composing with the encouragement of her teacher. Wang then went on to receive her undergraduate degree at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Outside of formal training, music surrounded Wang — both her father and grandmother sang opera. Before she began playing piano,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>singing was her passion — she can still perform excerpts from the Beijing and Qinqiang Operas, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After receiving her undergraduate degree, Wang went on to earn her doctoral degree in composition at Columbia. She then lived in Rome and Chicago, composing alongside her husband. Her work often focuses on environmental crises, inspired by her experiences living around the world, Wang said. Recent compositions incorporate the heart rates of extinct animals played alongside footage of air quality warnings. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“What interests me and moves me is … the world we live in — the social, political and environmental,” Wang said. In China, many rely on the air quality index to determine whether or not they will go out that day, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “As an artist, or as a human, we should all be aware and be responsible,” Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For Wang, this message plays a formative role in her creative process. “You think about how the crisis is affecting who you are, and it will translate into your music. It is important to not just write music because you like the sound,” Wang said. “I feel like everyone has a way to spread a message. For me, I’m a musician.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wang draws her inspiration from many sources, whether that be early Chinese rock and roll, free jazz or classical piano­ — even, on one occasion, her students’ Tinder notifications. “Some of my students told me about Tinder,” she said. “I had never heard of Tinder, so I wrote this piece using notifications sounds together with romantic quotations.” Through these materials, Wang addressed “what romance means.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Having taught at Brown for one and a half years, Wang said she’s fascinated and impressed by undergraduate students. “Some of them are learning for the first time, and they can just get it,” she said. “They make me think; they give me my favorite songs.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Her students are likewise impressed with her. “Talking to her is like taking a shot of espresso — engaging and inspiring,” MacDougald said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The xx demonstrates bold artistic development with new LP ‘I See You’</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Since the rise of band member Jamie xx’s solo career, nothing has been the same for London-based indie pop band the xx. In 2015, Jamie xx — the 28-year-old English DJ and record producer long at the helm of many of the group’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>best beats — released his breakthrough solo effort “In Colour.” Marking a serious detour from the sensual, reserved tones and themes found throughout the xx’s discography, the solo record instead leans toward brasher sonics and abundant sampling. The LP’s lead single “I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times),” featuring choppy rhyming by rapper Young Thug and splashes of reverb, is maybe the most obvious counterpoint to the drab and passive material present on the xx’s “Coexist,” the band’s last LP.</p>
<p class="p2">“Coexist,” released in 2012, epitomizes much of the common criticism of the Young Turks-signed band — namely, vocalists Romy Croft and Oliver Sim’s often bland and understated delivery. At their best, the restricted vocals and forlorn lyrics of the two effectively convey an anguished sense of longing. The greatest music by the xx is characterized by an all-too-powerful sense of romantic restraint — perfect for soundtracking the inconspicuous hookups of the modern era. But at their worst, Croft and Sim provide the listener with little more than passionless and pretentious murmurs, reflecting an inorganic depression. This flat minimalism, accentuated by Jamie xx’s stripped-back production, easily lends itself to an ambivalent listening experience and is much more evident on “Coexist” than on the band’s debut release.</p>
<p class="p2">Released five years after “Coexist,” the third LP by the xx, “I See You,” is a brave and welcomed new world for the British indie institution. The xx clearly took notes from 2015’s “In Colour” and at least partially distanced itself from its minimalist roots. In an interview with New Music Express, a prominent British music publication, Jamie xx stated that his solo album “definitely informed” what the band would be doing on its next album. Hearing the LP’s first single, the influence is undeniable.</p>
<p class="p2">With bold textures taken straight out of disco and a sampled Hall and Oates hook, radio hit single “On Hold” most clearly evinces the extent of the xx’s evolution. While the newfound manic energy and sampling are obvious nods to “In Colour,” the xx succeeds in demonstrating artistic progression that comes off as neither contrived nor an abandonment of the band’s previous themes. If anything, the xx’s distinctive brand of melancholy is accentuated. In the opening lines of the single, Craft croons “I can’t hold on/To an empty space,” lamenting her loss with an urgency that is seamlessly complemented by pulsating, heart-thumping rhythms. “On Hold” ostensibly details a break-up with a former lover — a narrative it does due justice. After hearing the song, it’s difficult not to have a head flooded with as many memories of past relationships as the song has beats per minute. But the dense layers of instrumentation obscure a deeper reading of the track: the xx’s break-up with a former sound.</p>
<p class="p2">Much of the band’s output up to this point functioned as a glacial and reflective setting for a passive listener. Yet on “I See You,” there truly is little room for the “empty space” Croft alludes to abandoning. Deeper cuts like “I Dare You” and “Dangerous” operate in the same engaging vain as “On Hold,” effectively embracing the newly aggressive, Jamie xx-inspired sound. Croft and Sim still sing and write with the same crestfallen affect that made older songs such as “VCR” and “Angels” so effective; they have merely traded ambience for more violent noise.</p>
<p class="p2">The only major misfires of the record are its regressions. Stumbling back into sleep-inducing territory and awkward executions, tracks like “Lips” remind listeners of what rendered “Coexist” so forgettable. While the lyrical platitudes and lazy instrumentals might appeal to some, the forced malaise and sensuality come across as boring. Most of the LP avoids devolving into a Tumblr blog’s soundtrack — it’s about three years too late anyway — thankfully opting instead for bold experimentation.</p>
<p class="p2">The efforts of individual members fuse together on “I See You.” Croft and Sim’s delivery and Jamie xx’s production work wonderfully together as a true confluence of tenderness and energy. The most interesting artists in music are at once irrevocably tied to their style and increasingly set on transcending it. Saying the indie pop group hits this paradoxical apex would be too much praise. Ultimately, the xx remains too mired in a pseudo-depressed sound to reach a creative peak with the LP.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But with “I See You,” the band offers some much-needed stylistic change and more than hints at an actualization of potential.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Sweet/Vicious’ grapples with campus sexual assault</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“People are just getting away with awful things. I’m trying to make some of that right,” says protagonist Jules Thomas on MTV’s ongoing series “Sweet/Vicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “Sweet/Vicious,” which premiered last November, tells the story of two typical college students — Jules , portrayed by Eliza Bennett, and Ophelia Mayer, portrayed by Taylor Dearden — who each take on a vengeful vigilante persona at night. Ophelia is a computer wizard and a green-haired outsider with perfect grades and a terrible attendance record. Jules is a popular sorority member hiding a secret alter ego and a painful past. Forging a unique friendship along the way, the girls join together to form a vigilante team that specializes in late-night ambushes of rapists on the school’s campus. The genre of the show is best described as an amalgamation of action, drama and comedy: a blend that is effective at times and less so at others, as is the show’s approach to discussing the hot-button topic of sexual assault. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rape on college campuses is an extraordinarily relevant issue, and media centering on this subject has the potential to be meaningful and evocative. “Sweet/Vicious” encapsulates many aspects of such compelling media. Rather than blaming rape victims, “Sweet/Vicious” humanizes them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It holds perpetrators accountable and demonstrates that those who commit sexual assault do not all conform to a single profile. These are all important points, and “Sweet/Vicious” addresses them carefully and effectively. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Less commendable is the way in which the show reduces sexual assault to something that can be addressed simply via midnight violence, leg-stabbing, electrocution and even — spoiler alert — murder. Take the very first scene of the series: Jules, dressed as some kind of imitation ninja, crawls into a student’s dorm room, warns him — through a voice changer, of course — never to commit the act again, stabs him in the thigh and leaves without even retrieving the weapon. The whole scene comes across rather farcically; it is neither realistic nor tasteful, and espouses the idea that inflicting violence on another individual is the only way to settle the score. Sexual assault is more of a systemic, prevalent issue than a series of nighttime ambushes can resolve. While Ophelia and Jules are attacking rapists, their words intentionally echo those of the rapists themselves, something that may strike viewers as more uncomfortable than empowering. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, this is a TV program about teenage vigilantes, and it’s not as though Batman is any less violent in fighting crime. Still, considering the show’s central theme bears such enormous relevance to student life on campuses today, it’s unfitting to talk about “Sweet/Vicious” in the same context as other superhero series. Things might be different if the protagonists had any sort of significant qualms about their actions — but they don’t, and that’s a problem. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But in terms of sheer entertainment value, “Sweet/Vicious” has its moments. The juxtaposition of lighthearted humor and darker scenes works well. Moreover, the humor is snappy, highly referential and very appropriate for its 21st-century audience. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As leads, Bennett and Dearden have lukewarm chemistry. Both fit their roles well — Ophelia’s snarky sarcasm is typical of a token “edgy teen” character, but Dearden delivers it so well that would-be bland lines are made humorous. The same goes for Jules’ wide-eyed naivete, which could be frustratingly saccharine if not for Bennett’s endearing delivery. Character relationships are another big plus. Jules and Ophelia’s partnership aside, it is heartwarming — and sometimes heartbreaking — to watch the interactions between Jules and her sorority sister Kennedy, portrayed by Aisha Dee. Their care for each other is so pure and authentic that it automatically boosts the quality of the show.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the show also suffers from stereotypical side characters, plot line inconsistency between first season episodes and an admittedly ridiculous storyline, as Ophelia’s hacking prowess ensures that a timely deus ex machina is always in reach. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Sweet/Vicious” does, at times, recognize its own implausibility. For example, in one scene, Ophelia asks Jules: “Who takes their bright pink sorority backpack to vigilante target practice?”— a very meta nod to the absurdity of the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Maybe “Sweet/Vicious” tackles issues of sexual assault in an empowering way, or maybe such issues would be best addressed through other platforms. It’s up to the viewer to decide. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Providence coffee shops offer unique atmospheres</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Thomas Jefferson once said, “Coffee is the favorite drink of the civilized world.”</p>
<p class="p2">These words still ring true — there is perhaps no drink as ubiquitous in the life of the college student as coffee. It can be a morning ritual, a classroom accessory, a social stimulant or a late night savior. Luckily, for Brown students the East Side is spotted with quality, local options for that all-important brew.</p>
<p class="p2">Nestled between trendy boutiques and restaurant, Dave’s Coffee has become a favorite of South Campus dwellers and off-campus residents. Located on South Main Street, its rustic wooden signage serves as a constant beacon to potential coffee-seekers. Well-sized with cozy bench seating in the back, Dave’s Coffee easily allows patrons to remove themselves from the din near the counter.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s the perfect place to escape and get some work done. I love the music they play,” said Marissa Moreno, a resident of East Providence and frequenter of Dave’s Coffee. “It’s indie and fresh and really conducive to focus.”</p>
<p class="p2">“It reminds me of home,” said Emma Wexler ’18.5, a frequenter of her local Bay Area coffee roasters.</p>
<p class="p2">One of Dave’s Coffee’s most alluring options is its specialty lattes, with unique flavors like “Coffee Milk” and “Vanilla Bourbon.” The store also sells its own coffee syrup, which patrons can use to make Rhode Island’s famous coffee milk.</p>
<p class="p2">Dave’s Coffee’s intimate setting is echoed over on Wickenden Street at The Shop — a cozy, welcoming cafe, which The Shop Barista John Henry said boasts “a great community feel.”</p>
<p class="p2">“We get students, professors and commuters,” he said. “Everyone is always working on something interesting, and I love hearing about it.”</p>
<p class="p2">Bench and bar-style seating adds emphasis to this intimate feel, encouraging singletons to mingle with their fellow coffee drinkers.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite a smaller menu that prioritizes coffee, patrons praised the quality of the food. “The avocado toast is awesome,” said Nathan Buchwald ’19. “They give you practically a whole avocado.”</p>
<p class="p2">Further down Wickenden Street, East Side students flock to Coffee Exchange. Charming and full of greenery, Coffee Exchange has an impressive array of coffees, teas, pastries and beans. Joseph Austerweil, former professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological studies was known to urge his classes to try its Cubano, a strong, espresso-like shot.</p>
<p class="p2">“I brew my own coffee at home, but I go to Coffee Exchange for my beans. The baristas are really knowledgeable about the roasts,” said Jonathan Chemburkar ’19, a devotee of the cafe.</p>
<p class="p2">In a more secluded location on Governor Street, Tea in Sahara, though known for its tea, carries a small selection of Moroccan coffees.</p>
<p class="p2">Daniel Plaisance ’19 cites Tea in Sahara as his favorite coffee shop, noting its “spaciousness” and “laid back atmosphere.”</p>
<p class="p2">Tea in Sahara also offers an assortment of Middle Eastern fare, including hookahs, a hot and made-to-order falafel and sweet, sticky baklava.</p>
<p class="p2">Malachi’s, perhaps the local hotspot furthest from campus, is a small, family-owned coffee shop known for its enormous iced coffees served in mason jars and Portuguese-inspired food selections. The baristas also serve up frozen, blended drinks including a unique local favorite: the Chaistachio, a chai tea and pistachio flavored creation.</p>
<p class="p2">Another popular menu selection is the tea, which has Providence College student Salvatore Flight making the trek to Malachi’s whenever he can. “The coffee is great, but my favorite drink here is their green tea,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">For students looking to get their coffee fix from local Providence cafes, East Side offers a strong selection of not only flavors, but also atmospheres.</p>
<p class="p2">“For me it’s all about the vibe,” said Thea Monje ’19. “When you find a place that makes you happy, you can just settle in, get some work done and enjoy.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Race, gender define Oscars’ best picture race</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/01/26/race-gender-define-oscars-best-picture-race/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Golden Globes, affectionately known as the little (and drunker) brother to the Academy Awards, aired with much fanfare Jan. 8. Yet despite all the conversation and attention that the awards ceremony generates, the Golden Globes themselves provide relatively little insight into who will collect Oscar hardware in February. The Golden Globes occur several weeks before Oscar nominations are even announced, introducing a format that lends itself to a certain measure of awkwardness. Indeed, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, whose performance in “Nocturnal Animals” won him a Golden Globe for best supporting actor, did not even receive an Academy Award nomination. Additionally, “La La Land” and “Moonlight” both earned Golden Globes in their respective categories for best musical or comedy and best drama, though they will compete for best picture at the Academy Awards.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Such discrepancies are expected, as the separate voting bodies responsible for the Golden Globes and Oscars differ in both adjudication style and membership. Nonetheless, while the Golden Globes might not offer a precise means of predicting future Oscar winners, they, at the very least, identify and uncover the emerging narratives that will define the Academy Award season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In separating “La La Land” and “Moonlight,” the Golden Globes failed to address the most contentious debate of early Oscar buzz — which frontrunner will win the best picture honor come February. Race once again dominates the awards season and is particularly central to the arguments surrounding “La La Land” and “Moonlight.” Following the #OscarsSoWhite controversy of previous years, “Moonlight,” which narrates the life of an impoverished gay black man named Chiron, comes as a tonic to the Academy’s aversion to art either celebrating black life or authored by black auteurs. It is characterized as the “serious” and “important” counter to the feel-good pastiche of antiquated Hollywood musicals in “La La Land.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Moonlight” suffers more from this characterization. The film falls victim to its own strengths: Critical dialogue surrounding Chiron’s experience as black, gay and male inevitably leads to bland conclusions about the movie’s “seriousness.” These conclusions allow audiences to indirectly treat the film as an opportunity to fulfill “woke-ness” quotients rather than recognize it as a legitimately beautiful art piece. “Moonlight” isn’t “important” just because of Chiron’s race and gender, but rather because of Director Barry Jenkins’ ability to communicate the suffering bound up in America’s centuries-long toxic treatment of black male sexuality. Jenkins treats Chiron not simply as a vehicle for that communication but rather as a fully-realized human being.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Discourse surrounding “La La Land” has also ventured into the cultural morass of race and gender. The film has faced criticism for Ryan Gosling’s character’s penchant for “mansplaining” jazz to co-star Emma Stone’s character. Moreover, critics argue that the film gives into cinema’s white savior narrative cliche — as Ira Madison wrote for MTV: “The wayward side effect of casting Gosling as this jazz whisperer is that ‘La La Land’ becomes a Trojan horse white-savior film … In ‘La La Land,’ the fate of a minority group depends on the efforts of a well-intentioned white man.” Criticism for “La La Land” is as unfair as that for “Moonlight”; the film is not a jazz movie, but rather uses jazz as to explore the very human flaws of its subjects. In its portrayal of two artists struggling to hone a craft, “La La Land” explores tensions between professional and romantic passions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The undue effects of advertising space and box office success also add to the contentious nature of the Best Picture race. “La La Land” has enjoyed a stronger Oscar advertising campaign, purchasing 1,872 square inches of total advertising space compared to the paltry 266 bought by “Moonlight,” according to statistics aggregated by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whos-trying-to-buy-an-oscar-nomination/">FiveThirtyEight</a>. Furthermore, “La La Land” has reeled in $175 million in total <a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/La-La-Land#tab=summary">box office revenues</a>, against the <a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Moonlight-(2015)#tab=summary">$15 million</a> brought in by “Moonlight.” These figures have only furthered the narrative of “Moonlight” as a progressive David fighting the conventionalist Goliath of “La La Land.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Regardless of which film wins the best picture race, “Moonlight” and “La La Land” have charged the early Oscar season with competing discourses on race and gender.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>RISD Museum offers free entry on Inauguration Day</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/01/26/risd-museum-offers-free-entry-inauguration-day/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In response to the sentiments of anger and trepidation surrounding the Trump presidency expressed by many within the art community, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum offered free admission to the public on Inauguration Day Jan. 20.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The free admission elicited a positive response from the Providence public. According to Colleen Mullaly, the RISD Museum’s manager of visitor services, 378 people visited the museum that day. “A typical Friday in January may have half that number,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The decision to offer free entry came largely in response to a call for collective anti-Trump resistance in the art world, known as the #J20 Art Strike, said Amee Spondike, director of development and external affairs for the RISD Museum.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We are always looking at the community at large and thinking about our place within the art world. Very early it became clear that the #J20 group was calling for a boycott of sorts,” Spondike said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The movement, made up of artistic institutions and artists who asked museums, galleries and other spaces “to close on the day of the inauguration as a form of concern about what the Trump presidency might look like in terms of freedom of expression and … human rights in general,” said Director of the RISD Museum John Smith. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But after witnessing expressions of solidarity through social media outlets and discussing the movement with RISD President Rosanne Somerson and colleagues at other museums, the RISD Museum directors decided to keep its doors open to the public.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Instinctively, (closing) didn’t feel like the right idea to me or (Smith) — as an art museum, it felt like a waste of an opportunity for us,” Spondike said. “We both agreed to be open and free that day — both of our moral compasses pointed to this, and I’m proud of that decision,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We are a public institution that considers itself welcoming, where people can gather in good times, bad times and everything in between,” Smith said. “Free admission sends a very strong message about our belief that museums are places that are inclusive places where conversations can occur between and among people of all backgrounds and all points of view.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The directors did not intend the free admission to be interpreted as a direct political statement, but rather as an acknowledgement of the art community concern surrounding the incoming Trump administration’s attitude toward the arts, Smith said. Through this decision, they hoped to assert the vitality of art within a civil society. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The museum’s intent was to remain inclusive, an open space that stimulates conversation, Smith added. “Museums are community spaces where people of all backgrounds can and should come together.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As there is “really something here for everyone … this was an opportunity for us to open our doors, as we hope that everyone feels safe at the RISD Museum,” Spondike said. “Art museums can play a role in helping us share in moments of humanity … and help spark a greater understanding.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The RISD Museum was not the only art institution offering free admission on Inauguration Day. Others offered a “pay what you want” option, extensive programming or lectures, while others went about business as usual, Smith said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The arts community is as diverse as a country. I am sure that across the country there are artists and others who support Trump and others who obviously feel strongly the other way,” Smith said. “I think and hope that (what) artists share in common is the belief that freedom of expression in whatever form that takes is something to be celebrated rather than something to be denied.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brown Opera Productions kicks off semester</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Brown Opera Productions put on its first show of the semester, the Winter Arias Concert, on Friday, Jan. 27. The concert, an informal production, featured 10 singers and accompanying pianists and served as a way to welcome artists and students back to campus.</p>
<p class="p2">The genre of individual performances varied, ranging from theatrical musicals such as “Light in the Piazza” by Adam Guettel to more classic opera productions such as Mozart’s “The Magic Flute.” Singers were free to perform a piece of their choice.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The Winter Arias Concert is a nice welcome back to Brown but also serves as a celebration of these people that have amazing talents,” said Isabel Thornton ’19, co-chair of the BOP Board. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Unlike other BOP projects, the Winter Arias Concert has no audition process. The organization strives to be as inclusive as possible of all students and singers of diverse musical backgrounds, Thornton said. Though most student performers had worked with BOP in the past, others were newcomers to the student organization.</p>
<p class="p2">“What we are trying to do with all of the projects we take on is appeal to people who wouldn’t necessarily be interested in something that has the label ‘opera’ on it,” said Sophie Urquhart ’18.5, co-publicity chair of the BOP Board and a performer in the concert. “With the Arias concert, that is particularly effective because people invite their friends who don’t know anything about opera and then experience it through someone that they know personally.”</p>
<p class="p2">In the past, BOP has sought to put on shows from a wide variety of operatic genres. “Last year we did the Beggar’s Opera, which was more of a folk opera,” said Flannery McIntyre ’19, publicity chair of the BOP Board. The year before that, BOP performed an opera by Astor Piazzolla that had never before premiered in the United States, McIntyre said.</p>
<p class="p2">This spring the student group is set to perform a rock opera inspired by The Who’s fourth studio album, “Tommy.” The decision to take on such a non-traditional opera goes hand in hand with BOP’s ambition to widen the Brown student population’s definition of the operatic genre, Thornton said.</p>
<p class="p2">“A lot of people think that they can only be part of the Brown Opera Productions if they have this classical musical background,” Thornton said.</p>
<p class="p2">BOP encourages students outside of the organization itself to perform in or direct the production company’s various projects, she added, noting that participants usually come from the music or theater community.</p>
<p class="p2">Looking forward, BOP hopes to both involve more creative minds and musically inclined students in their productions and grow their audience by reaching students who might not necessarily think of themselves as opera aficionados, Thornton said.</p>
<p class="p2">“We also have ambitions to do more operas that have been composed by students on Brown’s campus.” Thornton said. “We’re looking into maybe doing a piece that was composed by a student next fall.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>RISD Museum names cartoonist as 2017 Artist Fellow</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Rhode Island School of Design Museum recently unveiled accomplished cartoonist Walker Mettling as a 2017 Artist Fellow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p2">Mettling is the head of the micro-publisher Providence Comics Consortium and the third recipient of the fellowship, which is funded by the Arts Works program, a part of the National Endowment for the Arts. His consortium has been lauded since its 2010 inception for its free comic book making workshops at local libraries across Providence.</p>
<p class="p2">Facilitated by generative exercises that incorporate creative input from children and adults alike, the Providence Comics Consortium defies any age-based stereotypes and seeks to bridge the gap between artistic age groups.</p>
<p class="p2">“I see the workshops’ attendees — the adults and kids — as a hive mind of a group and a richer well of creative ideas for the comic or publication being made that day,” Mettling said.</p>
<p class="p2">Inspired by children unfamiliar with Providence’s prominent art scene, the printmaker feels compelled to create overlap between the two age demographics, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">This sentiment of inclusion is also reflected in the principles lauded by the RISD fellowship initiative program.</p>
<p class="p2">“(The RISD fellowship) is a more (thoughtful) way of connecting with community members at large,” said Alexandra Poterack, the <span class="s1">museum’s associate educator of public and academic programs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Kids in town don’t realize they’re in a sort of art hub. There are older people very near at hand in this community, and adults should feel obliged to share their resources with these kids,” Mettling said. “We should be focused on fostering a community where everyone gets to make art.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As an artist fellow, Mettling will receive “access to research resources from the RISD Museum collections and RISD Fleet Library,” wrote Sarah Ganz Blythe, the museum’s deputy director of exhibitions, education and programs, in an email to The Herald. In addition, each fellow enjoys a $10,000 stipend, the ability to audit select RISD graduate studies courses and mentorship from both RISD Museum and RISD College staff, Blythe said. <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both an extension of extant artistic interests and a cultivation of new ones, the artist’s proposals align clearly with the mission of the fellowship.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Walker’s exciting proposal explores the collection in creative and thought-provoking ways and comes at a critical juncture in his professional development,” Blythe said, noting Mettling’s work with the Providence Comics Consortium as evidence of this innovation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not only does the creative’s goals for the fellowship facilitate the use of the museum’s veritable wealth of collections by local children and adults, but it also includes space for more personal projects.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Making action figures inspired by the museum’s art is something I’ve been wanting to meditate on,” Mettling said, evidencing a particular interest in figures that depict Roger Williams and Nesmin, Rhode Island’s founder and the museum’s resident mummy, respectively. For Mettling, the action figures help him “facilitate teaching kids about the weird” as they “impart a lot of cultural meaning.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Q&amp;A: Linda Ford talks recent exhibit ‘Territorialize’</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">From Dec. 5 to Jan. 27, the Sarah Doyle Women Center Gallery presented “Territorialize,” a solo exhibition by Linda Ford. Using fly-fishing instruments throughout her work, Ford aims to explore the body and how it is used to attract others. The Herald spoke to Ford about her exhibition.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Q: Tell me about your art. </b></p>
<p class="p2">A: The Sarah Doyle exhibit is a project that I’ve been doing for a few years now that’s exploring the practice of fly-fishing and fly-catching. … My work generally explores issues around the body, psychology and gender. This is a combination of these things in a little bit different way. It explores issues of attraction and display in the practice of fly-fishing and how it plays out in the human world when we think about attraction and what we do to attract a mate or to attract anyone.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What inspired this exhibit? </b></p>
<p class="p2">I grew up with a father who was an avid fly-fisher and I have two brothers who are still fly-fishers. Part of the experience was that I was the only girl, and so it wasn’t something I did on a regular basis with my father, as opposed to my brothers. I am taking it up again as an adult and exploring it from that perspective of not being included, while engaging with gender as well as other philosophical issues.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What message do you hope to extend with your artwork? </b></p>
<p class="p2">I hope my work makes people think about why we do some of the things we do. In this particular case, it would be to have people think about what we do in our lives that might be artistic — what animals do to attract other people and display themselves and how that plays out for human beings. I hope people come out of this thinking about the psychology of the things that we do.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Why do you think art is a good medium for addressing women’s issues? </b></p>
<p class="p2">Art is a good medium for expressing all sorts of issues — especially what’s on people’s minds these days. I think art gets people to think about things differently and exposes people to different kinds of ideas and hopefully different sensations and experiences. It’s political when it opens someone’s mind up to something new to help them see something in a different way.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Why did you choose the Sarah Doyle Women’s Center to exhibit your art?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Originally, a friend of mine had a show there a few years ago. I was interested that they were a center for women’s and gender issues. When I moved to Providence, I went to some shows there, and I loved the old 19th-century house. It’s very domestic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s perfect for the work I’m doing right now because it engages gender issues, women’s issues and issues of attraction.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How did you get started with art? </b></p>
<p class="p2">As a child, I watched my dad draw and paint. He was self-taught and he had very little education, but besides fishing, it was the only other thing he did for enjoyment and relaxation. It was one of the rare times I ever saw him being that way, relaxed and escaping his mental health issues and his addiction issues. So I think that, as a child, I interpreted art as a way to be happy, and I started drawing as a kid.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How do you perceive your pieces are representative of your worldview?</b></p>
<p class="p2">Most artists make work about what they’re preoccupied with in their lives. I think this series of work about fly-fishing is interesting in different ways for me. I think we have a lot in common with animals ­— in a good way. We’re engaged with our bodies, and I think our strength lies in those sorts of things, but I think bodily knowledge and these other ways of knowing things are really important, and they’re often dismissed in our culture, like being female.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>What were challenges in engaging with the theme of attraction and display for this particular exhibit?</b></p>
<p class="p2">The challenge is getting to push the fly-fishing practice beyond what it is already. So it became apparent for me in this show that I need to think more about where to go with making flies and what they might become.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Do you think art speaks for itself? </b></p>
<p class="p2">Art speaks really loudly for itself. But I think, as viewers, it’s interesting to have dialogue about art, and it’s necessary to do that. But I do think art speaks for itself because our bodies respond to art, but we have to feel confident enough to pay attention and respond to the sensations and the internal responses we have. It’s just a matter of feeling like you can do it. I think that’s kind of what art is all about, because it’s so visual and it’s not about words. It’s a visual practice — we just have to develop our own way of responding to these things and being okay and comfortable with doing that.</p>

		<title>Insomnia Cookies to open on Thayer Street</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many students may be familiar with the small, inconspicuous gray house just a few blocks up from Pembroke campus and CVS. Now one of the oldest buildings on Thayer street, 307 Thayer St. was originally built in 1865. For a long time, 307 Thayer was used for auxiliary housing, available to be rented out by students. But now the building will serve as home to a new late-night spot<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— in a few short months, Insomnia Cookies will be moving in.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Founded in 2003 by Seth Berkowitz, then a student at Penn, Insomnia Cookies specializes in the sale and delivery of fresh-baked cookies as well as ice cream and brownies, which are served throughout the day and late into the night — until 2 a.m., to be exact.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The decision to bring Insomnia to Thayer was “really related to two events,” </span><span class="s1">said </span>John Luipold, vice-president of real estate at Brown<span class="s1">. “The first is the house that we are renovating — we’ve wanted to renovate (it) for a long time. … But we wanted to do it in a way where it made economic sense to the University.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second event took place while Luipold and his daughter were touring the University of Delaware at Newark, where they came across an Insomnia </span><span class="s2">Cookies on Newark’s East Main Street. “(It was) a very small space,” Luipold said. “I thought to myself, ‘Wow, this could fit perfectly at 307 Thayer Street.’ And then I ate their cookies, and I said: ‘I have to bring Insomnia Cookies to Thayer Street.’”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">When Luipold returned to Providence, he contacted the University’s brokers and asked them to pursue opening an Insomnia Cookies on Thayer. Renovations on the house began in October 2016, and the store is likely to open in April. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“The location will deliver one to two miles from our location, covering all of Brown’s campus and much of the off-campus housing and local Providence community,” wrote Courtney Altamura, senior marketing manager at Insomnia, in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“We decided to open in Providence because the area seems to have a strong sense of community,” Altamura added. “Given that we are open and deliver late, we tend to be a favorite among students on college campuses, but we have found many a customer in local businesses and families alike.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Community members benefit not only from the cookie shop itself but also the building’s renovation. “From a beautification point, it provides a renovation to a historic structure on Thayer Street. So that benefits not only the Brown community, but the College Hill community (as well),” Luipold said. “We also wanted to identify tenants … that would be appealing and fun, and we think that (Insomnia Cookies) will be all of that.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While retail hours have yet to be decided, the delivery service will run from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. — perfect hours for late-night snacking. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I love Insomnia Cookies. (In) New York City, they were everywhere … so it was a good late-night snack when you’re in a funk or even just celebrating with friends,” said Eileen Cruz ’20.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some students simply consider Insomnia Cookies a novel addition to the current array of food shops on Thayer. “If I’m going to get a late night dessert, I go to Ben and Jerry’s a lot — so (Insomnia Cookies) is just another option,” said Daniel de Castro ’20.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article said that Insomnia Cookies will deliver until 3 a.m.. In fact, it will only deliver until 2 a.m.. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guided by the lights of their cell phones and an address revealed only the day before, a crowd arrived at an anonymous house on Orchard Street Sunday night. At first, there was a trickle of people coming in, a few individuals scattered on chairs — mostly Brown students dressed in Doc Martens, maroon sweaters and flannels. A crowd of representatives from the women’s cross country team sat on the couch, a few upperclassmen crouched against the wall and, in the kitchen, a group of students stood in T-shirts that read “Be still and know.” There were also outliers, such as middle-aged Michael and Sue from Massachusetts who had heard about the event on CBS. A mountain of belongings accumulated in the doorway — a Brown crew backpack, coats ranging from puffy-fur hybrids to well-worn jean jackets and the casual, but not pervasive, beer bottle or can. In the back rested a pile of sound equipment: drums, a microphone and various amps. As 8:30 p.m. approached, three bands remained disguised among the chattering onlookers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sofar Sounds is an elusive worldwide organization that sponsors gigs as far as Bombay, India and as close as Providence. The organization attempts to create an intimate space for purified music listening, which means no phones, no chatting during the set and no walking out halfway through the show. “Everyone is listening so intently, and there is so much respect for the artist” said Lindsay Sack ’19, media manager of Sofar Sounds Providence. To accomplish this, Sofar Sounds requires each potential audience member to apply for a spot at the concert. From the applicant pool, local volunteer organizers select an inclusive mix, attempting to allot spots equally among genders, while also considering previous attendance to maintain a strong fan base.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Every show is completely different — you go to a show, and you never know what you’re going to get,” said David Sasson ’17, co-founder of Sofar Sounds Providence. For their gigs, which occur once or twice a month, Sofar Sounds Providence often has twice as many applicants as it can feasibly fit. Each attendee has the option to bring a plus-one and pay a donation of a minimum of five dollars. The shows feature three acts that are revealed the day before, along with the location. The bands receive a cut of the donations or an opportunity to appear on the widely-followed Sofar Sounds YouTube channel. Sunday’s show featured Electric Kitty from Brown, Samurai Sword from Connecticut and She Keeps Bees, a Brooklyn-based rock band. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When Electric Kitty took the stage ­— or what is more accurately described as a corner — the crowd settled into a comfortable, attentive silence. The lead singer, Aidan Cron ’19, started with a description of the band name, which is derived from an incorrect reference to a failed Cold War CIA project. According to Cron, the United States trained a coalition of cats with listening devices implanted in their ears to spy on Soviet generals. The name of the covert operation? Acoustic Kitty. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The band’s energetic acoustic set featured songs with names like “Whiskey Mountain” and “Beach House” that recall a distinctive indie rock subgenre that relies heavily on history and myth. As most of the audience sat on the floor, dancing was limited to light head nodding, which gradually became more intense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Samurai Sword was up next, and changed the tone entirely. Josh Pavel, the singer-guitarist bashfully thanked “the Sofar dudes, people and stuff” before beginning to play with a brassy, full sound. After a few acoustic songs, Pavel began to sing with a tone at once empathetic, longing and jarring, his hands fluttering tenderly from chord to chord. A cellist dressed in black joined him, and their voices melded beautifully in the space Pavel described as a “really cool wooden room.” At the set’s conclusion, the Sofar organizers invited audience members to tell jokes. Only Pavel volunteered, offering several variants of a theme: “21 Jump Street? What? Were jump streets one through 20 already taken?” “Motel Six? What? Were Motels one through five already taken?” and “27 Dresses? What? Were dresses one through 26 already taken?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She Keeps Bees, featuring Jessica Larrabee on vocals and guitar alongside her husband, Andy LaPlant, on drums, took the stage last. LaPlant described the duo’s music as rock with “a softness.” Larrabee saw the night as “trying to help with the insanity” of today’s political climate — a moment for “healing and community.” Her stage presence first brought on a comical tone as she engaged in a rambling monologue of self-effacing jokes, cursing and excited encouragement. “I grew my pimple all week for this,” she said. This created a stark contrast when her bubbly chatting abruptly transitioned into a powerful singing voice that struck the audience, filling the room with a soulful poetry. In a timely feminist rock anthem that overwhelmed the audience, Larrabee methodically chanted “Our bodies are our own!” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By the end of the show, there was a sense that something had been accomplished — Sofar Sounds had reached their goal of creating a show that was, as Sack put it, “just magic.” And this isn’t the first time, either. For Sack, Sofar Sounds provides “those few hours every month to connect to music and to connect to people.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since Sasson and Jaclyn Licht ’16 started Sofar Sounds Providence, shows have occurred everywhere from Dave’s Coffee and an overheated attic in the summer to a tiny room at WBRU radio station’s headquarters. Some have involved ten-person funk bands, acts like Busty and the Bass, Lawrence and Wild Rivers and, once, an impromptu second show when the band showed up four hours late. Once, a venue even loaned out Polaroids so audience members could take pictures.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Sofar Sounds maintains an air of mystery, Brown community members are encouraged to get involved, whether as organizers or audience members. The events are generally close to campus, Sasson said, and they are always open to new volunteers, guests and venues. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Scranton, Pennsylvania isn’t known for terribly much. Some might recognize it as the setting of NBC’s “The Office,” a show that humorously depicts the grind of working at a paper-making company — a droll job that epitomizes so much of Scranton’s mundanity. Once home to a prosperous coal industry, the city has since transformed into a paradigm of the commercially-depressed Rust Belt. The inhabitants there remain drained by the city’s dire economic straits. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet Scranton has fulfilled its purpose by serving as the inspiration for The Menzingers’ newest LP “After The Party.” Catered to those who feel marginalized, disenfranchised, frustrated and defeated, the Scranton-based punk band speaks to a certain brand of individual. Past albums, including 2012’s “On The Impossible Past” and 2014’s “Rented World,” detail the monotony of dead-end food service jobs, the futility of gas station lotto tickets and other generally bleak circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Similar to the band itself and for the hopelessly trapped characters whose storylines are recounted within these songs, punk is a platform for expressing discontent — a veritable religion that binds and affirms society’s oppressed actors. It is a source of refuge for the blue-collar blues that is maybe eclipsed only by alcohol-soaked comfort. Holding dive bars and house parties as the wistful apotheosis of the Pabst Blue Ribbon-ridden twenty-something, the band speaks to a drunken escapism that would put Hemingway to shame. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But in “After The Party,” The Menzingers’ fifth studio album, the hangover has at least partially lifted. Just like the rays of the sun after a particularly heavy night of drinking, the album hits with painful clarity. Previous albums’ whiskey-fueled anthems have evolved into heart-on-the-sleeve ruminations in a thematic maturation that mirrors the band members’ coming-of-age. “Where are we going to go now that our twenties are over?” ponders Greg Barnett, the band’s frontman, on opening track “Tellin’ Lies.” The song is torn between ambivalence and longing for the past, reflecting a complicated nostalgia effortlessly highlighted by Barnett’s uncompromising sincerity. Full of references to a youth too quickly passed by, the lyrics carry both a wistful ephemerality and a sense of uncertainty. With a definite duality, the track’s catchy, driving melody belies and fails to capture the speaker’s serious fear of being perceived as a burn-out by society. This sharp contrast between thematic content and melodic choice captures Barnett’s dismay as he grows older. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The creeping “Black Mass” and the eponymous “After The Party” are also standouts that extend the regret-tinged, aged introspection to subjects like tired relationships and alternative culture. “After the Party” references “your silhouette in high top sneakers /And hardcore from laptop speakers,” singularly conveying the quintessential punk scene. “Lookers,” however, remains the LP’s most exceptional cut. With a speaker “lost in a picture frame” and shrouded by “a cloud full of nicotine,” the track is the apex of the album’s confessional nostalgia. Its position as the lead single of the album is no mistake; the lyrical wisdom is complemented by perhaps the band’s most infectious chorus to date. “Lookers,” arresting and thoughtful, embodies everything moving about punk, while “Charlie’s Army” stands as the album’s weakest link. Lyrically vapid and musically uninteresting, the track regresses to puerile punk that even blink-182 wouldn’t be caught dead making. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nostalgia remains an exercise in futility. It’s fitting that most of the memories explored on “After The Party” involve drinking. Like alcohol, nostalgia easily lends itself to dangerous, fleeting self-indulgence. But on the LP, The Menzingers manage to avoid devolving into more maudlin aspects. Rather, the punk act uses nostalgia to constructively reflect and look toward the past not dreamily, but warily. The album ultimately affirms the notion that being too embroiled in the past precludes progress, destining one for life as another Scranton townie burn-out. Luckily, that’s a future that the band, with their strongest album to date, almost certainly will not face.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Science, art converge at RISD Nature Lab</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Tucked away behind the Rhode Island School of Design Art Museum is another museum of sorts, less frequented by members of the Brown community than its conspicuous neighbor.</p>
<p class="p2">Described by Operations and Engagement Coordinator Lucia Monge as “a place where art and science come together to explore the human nature,” the Nature Lab at RISD was founded in the early part of the 20th century by RISD graduate and, later, faculty member Edna Lawrence. From its early beginnings as an extension of Lawrence’s classroom, the Nature Lab’s collection has grown from 300 specimens to the almost 100,000 items that now make up the Lab’s continuously growing collection, said Lab Coordinator Betsy Sara Ruppa.</p>
<p class="p2">Lawrence taught nature drawing at RISD for over 40 years and believed strongly that the natural world and all its colors, patterns and shapes could and should positively inform artists’ creativity, Ruppa said. In 1937, RISD’s Waterman building became home to Lawrence’s nature drawing classroom and the host of natural specimens that informed her students’ work. After Lawrence’s retirement in the late 1970s, her nature drawing classroom was formally renamed the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab in her honor, Ruppa said.</p>
<p class="p2">The current collection is made up of plants, sponges, skeletons, taxidermy and geometric models, amongst other samplings, as well as technology such as a scanning electron microscope, geographical information systems and high-speed cameras.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s a combination of a natural history museum and a lending library, full of specimens, which are used as a teaching tool,” Ruppa said.</p>
<p class="p2">The lab is also home to a few living specimens, including a nine-year-old corn snake named Netop, which means “hello friend” in Wampanoag. Netop is the “most popular creature you’ll ever meet,” Ruppa said. Many RISD students, who come to the lab specifically to visit and play with the gentle snake, are among Netop’s numerous fans and admirers.</p>
<p class="p2">There is also a small contingent of axolotls, a type of salamander that, unlike most amphibians, never develops lungs and instead spends its life underwater. While endangered in the wild, axolotls are a popular research specimen. The gilled, legged, neotenous creatures are a common sight in laboratories where their ability to regenerate limbs and — under the duress of hormones or other stressors — morph into land salamanders makes them a fascinating study subject for biology students.</p>
<p class="p2">In fact, a biology classroom is exactly how the Nature Lab’s axolotls came to call RISD’s Waterman building home. A Brown student taking a comparative morphology class that worked with axolotl eggs wanted to save the eggs at the end of the lab work rather than have them thrown out, Ruppa said. The student had become acquainted with the Nature Lab after spending her summer working there as a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow. She decided to bring the eggs to the lab where they developed into a thriving population, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">“Here, they are nearly extinct, but they’re used regularly in research labs (all) over the globe,” Ruppa said. “So, they’re all over the place in captivity, but in the wild … (axolotls) are in one little lake (in Mexico).”</p>
<p class="p2">Fellowships through SURF, 10-week summer internships funded through the National Science Foundation, are but one of many ways that students are involved with the lab and its work. RISD is the only art school to have received a National Science Foundation grant, Monge said.</p>
<p class="p2">RISD students make up a large portion of the Lab’s daily maintenance workforce. Work-study students care for the lab’s living animals and learn how to pin insects, fix skeletons, make displays and acquire new specimens for museums.</p>
<p class="p2">Working at the Nature Lab is like being in a “biology or zoology classroom,” said Evan Fredriksen, a RISD student. While Fredriksen spends his time in the classroom majoring in Film/Animation/Video, at the Nature Lab he cares for the lab’s various animals and identifies specimens that the museum gathers based off field guides and other resources. “It’s pretty separate from artwork but uses a lot of the same skills,” Fredrikson said.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s not your typical art school education,” Ruppa said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p2">The Nature Lab is open for free to the RISD and Brown community, but members of the public must schedule visits and classroom field trips to the lab in order to use its resources. While RISD students primarily take advantage of the lab’s collections, it has increasingly become frequented by classes and individual students from Brown, Monge said. For RISD and Brown students alike, the lab serves as a place for students to “just be” and exist in a “biophilic space,” Monge said.</p>
<p class="p2">“Students here can learn from the arts and sciences and from nature itself,” Monge said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Books on the Square hosts poignant, timely poetry reading</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decorated poetess Tina Cane and up-and-coming poet Keegan Lester immersed Books on the Square’s audience in articulate elegance at a poetry reading Friday night. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The event was part of the bookstore’s initiative to bring in local writers, said Francesgrace Ferland, a bookseller at Books on the Square. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Most authors have some sort of local connection,” Ferland said. Cane herself was recently named Rhode Island’s poet laureate. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cane’s new role necessitates a heightened level of engagement in the public sphere. “It’s new for me. Being a poet is typically very solitary,” she quipped to the crowd. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Embracing her newfound responsibility, Cane underscored the relevance of poetry today given the United States’ current political climate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’ve been thinking about history, particularly my place as a poet-witness to history,” Cane said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She emphasized literature’s capacity for protest and the universality of its humanity throughout her reading, cementing its place in challenging power structures and political gridlock. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“As a poet, I will continue fighting. Writing is fighting,” Cane said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In light of President Donald Trump’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>immigration ban, both writers prefaced their work with readings culled from the affected nations’ poetic traditions. Cane opened with Iranian poetry from Mohsen Emadi, while Lester read Sudanese poetry by Safia Elhillo. Each of the readings heightened the event’s poignancy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(The poems’ inclusion) was very timely and on-point,” Ferland said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cane’s poetry drew on her experiences growing up in Hell’s Kitchen, New York. With lines replete in references to the area’s “seedy alley, subway and moon,” Cane’s works both submerged the reader in her adolescent coming-of-age among bodegas and the East Village and facilitated the poet’s own self-discovery. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I write to understand,” Cane said. “I never am able to think of how to describe my own experience, so writing is a way of revealing the things that I don’t really understand.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cane’s poetry also incorporated a measure of intertextuality. The works read played off of those produced by venerated writers Elena Ferrante and Federico Garcia Lorca, cementing the poet’s position in the broader literary tradition. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lester’s reading provided a sharp contrast to Cane’s poetry, juxtaposing her cultivated urbanity with a sense of heartland sincerity. Speaking with a slow, unaffected drawl, the West Virginia native touched on everything from orcas to football to the plight of the working class, all through the lens of his distinctive earnestness. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I wanted to prove that the mundane could also be beautiful,” Lester said. “I didn’t truly realize I was a good poet until a few years after my MFA program, when my mom told me she could understand what I was writing,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Jeanine Staples, associate professor of literacy and language, African American studies and women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Pennsylvania State University, addressed that question when she spoke Thursday in Pembroke Hall about the relationship between romance and social movements. She discussed her ethnographic research on identity — specifically that of heterosexual women involved in romantic relationships — which is the topic of her book “The Revelations of Asher: Toward Supreme Love in Self.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the book focuses on romantic and sexual relations as a window into the tenets of emotional estrangement and misguided love in the United States, it was intended to be something quite different. When Staples first began her ethnographic study, she intended to link the experiences of black women in post-9/11 America with those of women of color in fundamentalist Muslim nations. However, as she wrote, a connection emerged between terror on an interpersonal level and “Terror,” such as that which occurred on 9/11, on a larger scale. In this manner, Staples explores how “impacting, meaningful external revolutions are provided by meaningful, internal revelations.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Failing to confine itself to any one genre, the book is an innovative take on research analysis, experimenting with form, data presentation and storytelling. Throughout the novel, Staples plays with various techniques, compiling what is better described as a collage than a book into what she calls a “new literacies event.” The text, around 600 pages in length, consistently engages the reader through its dynamism and innovative presentation. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The book spans from factual to abstract, written as interspersed analysis, narrative and poetry. Staples begins with a recollection from her childhood and then transitions into an authentic conversation with her reader, assessing the anecdotes that she has collected and explaining their implications in contemporary society. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Much of the text is devoted to clarifying the book’s layout and intention in an accessible way while consciously catering to an academic readership. In one instant, the reader follows the stories of young black women discussing their crushes, then encounters an experimental poem on trauma, all while Staples breaks the fourth wall to discuss her motive for including the scenes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The section devoted to narrative amasses the experiences of women involved in the ethnographic study, each told through the lens of a group of distinct characters. The anecdotes, which center around themes in heterosexual relationships including abuse, breakups and abstinence, function as allegories for a larger cultural assessment. Each of the characters, or “fragmented selves,” represents reflections on the shared experiences of educated, black, Christian, heterosexual, cisgender women. Staples follows their stories as they experience various revelations, and the readers watch while each character’s unique perspectives on everything from God to ideal prospective husbands evolve. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Periodically, Staples creates an interlude for poetry relating to cultural events, specifically 9/11. Some poems also focus on her character’s lives, touching on various traumas including rape and child molestation through the characters’ own voices. Other times, Staples inserts e-mail exchanges, bible quotes and Q&amp;A sections, playing with the presentation of amassed data and the boundaries of traditional prose. Throughout the book, Staples identifies specific speakers and themes through untraditional fonts, highlighting and even changes in the color of the text. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Staples’ work ultimately revolves around a question posed by musician Rachelle Ferrell: “‘How can there be peace in the Middle East, when there’s none at home?’” Her text approaches the question within the parameters of a locally accessible narrative. She reveals to readers how by defying toxicity at home, women can approach an ultimate assertion of selfhood and oneness, a “supreme love” which “heals and saves people.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Swedish singer-songwriter Jens Lekman’s 2015 New Year’s resolution was daunting: He wanted to pen 52 songs — one for every week of the year. The project — officially titled “52 Postcards” — would have been a herculean undertaking for almost any musician, but Lekman pulled it off with aplomb. Few of Lekman’s “postcards” forsake quality for quantity, chronicling broken hearts and national crises through the lens of heartfelt and observational lyricism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the limit-defying artist responsible for “52 Postcards” must have experienced a degree of apprehension. Indeed, the track “Postcard #17” speaks to Lekman’s anxious mentality throughout the project. In a stroke of self-reflection, Lekman documents the creative instability inhibiting his writing, singing that he must “trick [him]self into pouring it all out.” Crippling self-doubt is something of a tired trope for the tortured artists of the world, but Lekman, independent music’s spokesman for dejection, opines on working through it with refreshing clarity and sincerity. On “Postcard #17,” Lekman depicts himself climbing out of a hole of insecurities, but at no point does the track ever feel forced or mired in overwrought sentimentality. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Postcard #17” reappears on Lekman’s newly released 2017 LP “Life Will See You Now,” an album that embodies this dark, emotionally fraught dimension of Lekman’s persona. Hints of his sorrow surface in 2012’s “I Know What Love Isn’t,” but the depression begins to manifest itself wholly in “Life Will See You Now.” Joining “Postcard #17” in its despondency, other songs on the album detail an ex-lover’s perfume (lead single “What’s That Perfume That You Wear?”) and an ailing friend’s tumor (the LouLou Lamotte-featuring “Evening Prayer”), presenting the listener with a humanizing and crestfallen Lekman. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But at no point does the despondency of the album preclude an enjoyable and engaging experience for the listener. Unlike so many tortured artists, who tend toward shrouding their depression in innumerable layers of irony, Lekman sings of his foibles with an endearing earnestness. Unwilling to veil their emotion with cynical self-consciousness, the songs play out like sincere documents of the mundane encounters one might have with a woeful friend at a bar, distancing the album from much of contemporary indie music. Closing track “Dandelion Seed” perhaps best embodies this sincerity<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>as a rainstorm-set rumination on Lekman’s emotional distance from his loved ones. With “Dandelion Seed,” Lekman<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>directly — and honestly — addresses an old friend about his own mounting insecurities. He lends a believable, anecdotal quality to the song by name-dropping locales within his native Gothenburg. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lekman capably describes day-to-day bouts of misery with these mundane vignettes, portraying quotidian experiences at bus stops and cathedrals with an arresting, transcendent heartache.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His capacity for poignantly capturing trivialities with an air of melancholy and admiration remains his most exceptional quality as a singer-songwriter. His songs are only made more remarkable by the fact that Lekman’s native language is not English. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The album’s score, replete with rich and upbeat tones, belies its pervading melancholy. Vibrant horns lifted from 80’s synthpop are paired with ebullient backing vocals from artists LouLou Lamotte and Tracey Thorn, providing a sound that would not be out of place on a Jackson 5 record. These elements offer a little levity to Lekman’s despair and grant the impossible-to-hate singer-songwriter a much-needed silver lining. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some critics might describe “Life Will See You Now” as post-ironic, full of a welcome sincerity that trumps an all-too frustrating irony. But that is probably too pretentious a phrase for Lekman, who describes how he simply aspires to be a social worker “just like his dad.” This lyric might be the record’s defining moment, a perfect display of the true and unaffected elements that make Lekman and his music so endearing to listeners.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I should be Poseidon,” a new collection of pictures and prose, seamlessly blends in with the first floor of Rhode Island Hall. Curated<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by Yannis Hamilakis, professor of classics, and his graduate-level ARCH 2153: “Archaeological Ethnography: A Multi-Temporal Contact Zone,” the exhibit stems from Hamilakis’ book titled “Camera Kalaureia: An Archaeological Photo-Ethnography.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The exhibition’s focuses on archaeological ethnography — “a new perspective on archeology that tries to connect past and present and include the voices of local communities,” Hamilakis said. The selected photographs were taken by Hamilakis’ co-author Fotis Ifantidis in the Greek island of Poros, home to the sanctuary of Poseidon, where archaeological research first began in 1894. The photography shows the continuous process of engaging with the site and with the community surrounding it. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hamilakis and Ifantidis worked with the local community of Poros over the course of three years, recording and photographing the community’s relationship with the ongoing archaeological research on the sanctuary. “The quote, ‘I should be Poseidon,’ comes from someone who used to live on that site,” Hamilakis said. There are a number of families that used to live on the current research site but were forced out to give way to excavation, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The quote challenges archeology, contests the whole idea of prioritizing the ancient past versus the contemporary moment and also speaks of the sometimes difficult relationship we establish with local communities,” Hamilakis said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The title of the exhibition also conveys a certain amount of doubt. Displaced locals of the archaeological site often question the knowledge that excavators bring, Hamilakis said. They say “‘You may know the academic dimension of these things — but I’ve lived here. I know the stones. I know the landscapes. I have worked the land.’” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The pictures in the exhibit were selected “in order to reflect elements that are central to archaeological ethnography: multi-temporality, use and reuse, displacement and questions of ownership, among others,” wrote Matthew Pihokker GS, a second-year archeology graduate student who helped curate the exhibit, in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The longest stretch of pictures in the exhibition follows a flashy plastic barrier set against a black and white photograph, connoting how “people perceive a separation between archaeologists and archeology on the one hand and local individuals and tourists on the other,” said Miriam Rothenberg GS, a third-year archeology graduate student who also helped curate the exhibit. That separation plays a great role in the exhibition’s narrative and is accompanied with questions that break the discipline down to make sure archaeology “really is for everyone,” Rothenberg added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other pictures “comment on the multiplicity of the site,” Hamilakis said. “On every archaeological site there are different moments. On this specific site, we prioritize the time in which the sanctuary was built,” Hamilakis said. “But what we are trying to convey in this project is the sense of multiple times — that in addition to that classical moment, there are other moments.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>PW brings campy style to Roman classic</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Production Workshop’s new play resembles a pop-up book come to life. The backdrop is clean-cut, cotton candy pink and two-dimensional. The music is upbeat and cheerful. The characters are loud and dramatic, popping out of the stage like jack-in-the-boxes — energetic, quick and attention-grabbing.</p>
<p class="p2">The show gently pokes fun of itself and lovingly recounts the tale of two young men captured in war and held prisoners by a rival region in ancient Greece. The play “The Captives” is the translation of the Roman playwright Titus Maccius Plautus’ comedy “Captivi.”</p>
<p class="p2">Initially, the visual gap between the ancient storyline and the vibrant set and cast that portray it might startle viewers. Indeed, the flashy, almost plastic-like setting seems more appropriate for gossiping housewives at a suburban barbecue on a sunny Saturday afternoon. It is precisely that gap between Latin play and suburban America that makes the show all the more entertaining.</p>
<p class="p2">Plautus’ comedy is appropriated for the modern United States. The set and costumes are pointedly flat. The jokes and gags are accessible and funny. The actors are punchy and cheeky. The set and music are riddled with pop culture references.</p>
<p class="p2">In fact, the entire play is framed like a modern television show, which gives this Latin play a faintly familiar ring. “Roman and Greek comedies set up what we now see as sitcoms,” said Anthony DeRita ’18, director of “The Captives.”</p>
<p class="p2">“The Captives” is a very self-aware performance in terms of its kitschy decor and quirky feel. It leans into its kookiness, toying with the limits of the theatrical stage and television set. Represented on stage are characters that would not normally be featured in a traditional play or movie. The playwright Plautus himself is on stage and is the only character in a toga. The stage managers are seen around the set, performing their own off-beat silent sketches like human versions of Universal Pictures’ Minions. The main characters interact with these anomalous presences on stage.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite the liberties taken with the play’s presentation, the storyline of Plautus’ “Captivi” remains. The flashy set accommodates the twists of the original plot such that the director’s decision to make surburbia the backdrop of a story written two millennia ago — while still surprising — is not so much of a stretch.</p>
<p class="p2">In conclusion, PW’s “The Captives” is made most interesting by its modern, experimental twist. The show is defined by its campy style that colors its every aspect — a style that somehow fits with a classic play that doesn’t take itself too seriously.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘The Mountaintop’ voices artistic protest</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/14/mountaintop-voices-artistic-protest/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Artistic protest is almost always an exercise in futility. It’s a medium that too easily devolves into one-track cliches which cease to uncover any greater truth. Books, songs and films explicitly produced to criticize needless foreign wars or affronts to human rights miss the point entirely. They are plagued by a dangerous and contrived hindsight, trading bold prescience for platitude-ridden intentionality. Organic urgency — not calculated sentimentality — is what produces good artistic protest.</p>
<p class="p2">Playwright Katori Hall’s “The Mountaintop” serves as a fine instance of artistic protest. Providence’s Trinity Repertory Company’s recent production<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is an account of the last day of Martin Luther King Jr.’s life. After seizing a Memphis audience with his “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” speech, the reverend, played by actor Joe Martin Jr., retires for the night at the storied Lorraine Hotel, where he is subject to the company of a particularly lively hotel maid, Camae, refreshingly portrayed by female lead Mia Ellis. The theatrical work revolves around dialogue between the quick-tempered Camae and a down-trodden King on the night of his assassination­ — a stylistic decision that imbues the story with humanity.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Marked by no shortage of grace or subtlety, the extended encounter explores the pair’s interesting dynamic with rapid-fire, colloquial exchanges. The King on display in “The Mountaintop” is uncertain, battered and crass, a characterization seamlessly developed by the play’s strong and dialect-heavy script. Tongue-in-cheek existential musings over Pall Mall cigarettes and clear flirtation between King and Camae gave the play a honed humorous edge. The astute, hilarious aspects of the play are well juxtaposed with the more sorrowful elements; namely, King’s humbling concern regarding the success of his efforts to combat racism. “I don’t want to be a martyr,” King says, in an anguished delivery. “I’m just a man,” he mutters, disabusing the audience of his perceived infallibility as an esteemed civil rights leader. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">King, apprehensive about his ability to effect social change, meets his foil in the immensely confident and capable Camae. Knocking the reverend down a peg one second and consoling him the next, Camae is a positively wonderful character. Part-way through the play, at the height of King’s disquietude, the hotel maid reveals herself as an angel, a physical manifestation of the piety that pervades King’s activism. She is a living expression of the ineffable and uncompromising divine. “Evil is not under God’s jurisdiction; good is” Camae says, advocating the virtues of clinging to the heavens. Newly reaffirmed in his resolve to fight for equality, King dies, assassinated outside the Lorraine.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The play ends with a series of clips illustrating the social progress made by black activists since King’s passing ­— an uplifting display that is hauntingly and evocatively capped by the New York Times’ recent headline declaring President Donald Trump’s 2016 victory, a figurative end for so much of the progress made by King and others. The synergy between the play’s themes and the final film clips is powerful, underscoring the frustrating fragility of activist movements. In the emotionally-charged talk that followed the play, lead actor Martin mentioned the theatrical work was not constructed as an intentional act of protest, and that is precisely why it is so successful in conveying its nuanced take on civil rights and in effectively challenging inequality. The production’s poignancy emerges from, to use the actor’s words, a simple commitment to “empathy” and “listening.”</p>
<p class="p2">It is a shame that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the performance’s ending is not accompanied by Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come,” a song Rosa Parks herself turned to in the wake of King’s death. Analogous to King’s anguish, the ballad offers a sharp contrast to the smoke vainly blown by so much of politically-conscious art — a true in-the-moment translation of the raw desperation of Cooke’s own experience of being turned away from a whites-only motel.</p>
<p class="p2">Similar to the poignant nature of Cooke’s anthem, “The Mountaintop” — astute, enjoyable and incredibly relevant — is a masterful work of theater.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Opera productions set in the middle of Times Square. A twelve-hour performance of Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro. Giant horse costumes dancing in a circle and lavish, Futurist dinners.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All these have been curated by Performa,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a New York City-based institution founded in 2004 that uses biennials to highlight the importance of performance art throughout the twentieth century and beyond. The founder, RoseLee Goldberg, a renowned art historian, critic and curator, gave a lecture Wednesday, focusing on her career as the founder and director of the nonprofit arts organization. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lecture was sponsored by the Brown Arts Initiative, whose “mission is to support all that is experimental, forward-thinking and cutting edge in the arts here at Brown,” said Butch Rovan, Faculty Director of the BAI. “I can’t think of anyone that better exemplifies that than RoseLee Goldberg,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Goldberg influenced the discipline of performance art with her book “Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present.” The book, which was first published in 1988, “has been a key text for teaching performance in universities throughout the world, including here at Brown,” said Anne Bergeron, managing director of the BAI. Goldberg’s book has since been published in 13 different languages, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Goldberg said she is fascinated by the people who are put on the sidelines in the conventional telling of the twentieth century’s artistic history. Women, for example, have often been omitted when looking back on the story of the twentieth century. Female artists had a difficult time piercing into the avant-garde art world — often their only way to break into the art sphere was through experimental dance. For this reason, performance art plays an important role in the narrative of twentieth century art.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Performa studies performance art pieces of the past and brings them back into the spotlight. The aim is “not to recreate these moments but to do a contemporary version of what these pieces may be about,” Goldberg said. “In each discipline, we’re taking these historic moments, reaching back, talking about what that period was about, reinvestigating it and then finding ways to rethink of it in a contemporary vein.” Performa’s performance art festivals occur every two years, with the next one planned for November 2017. Each performance within the festival is set in a unique venue across New York City.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beyond the study of performance art’s historic role, Performa invites contemporary artists to collaborate with them in the creation of modern performances. These commissions include artists with varying levels of performance art experience, often featuring artists from other disciplines.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Past Performa productions include a puppet show put on by sculptor and painter Wyatt Kahn. The show featured puppet-versions of Kahn’s own paintings engaging in dialogue with each other. There have been dance productions where half of the dancers were painted in gold and the other half in black. During their show, as dancers moved and interacted with each other, their body paint mixed and blended so that each dancer appeared as a burnished golden statue come to life. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Through its unconventional performances, Performa is “a celebration of the extraordinary imagination of the artist,” Goldberg said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article said that Performa hosts "biannual festivals to highlight the importance of performance art." In fact, they host biennials. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The last thing the world needs is another play,” said Julia Izumi GS, echoing a sentiment made by Professor of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies Erik Ehn. With this in mind, TAPS organized Writing is Live, a festival of cross-genre theatrical exploration that seeks to go past the typical play format. The festival, which took place in Leeds Theater last weekend, showcased student playwriting through a series of works-in-progress.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The event “gets everyone involved,” Maurice Decaul GS said. Writers from the Master of Fine Arts in Playwriting program work with actors and directors from the Brown University/Trinity Rep MFA program. But with only 40 hours of rehearsal, editing continued until moments before the performance, plays ran over, actors read off-script and writers joined the audience, all leading to a casual, spontaneous atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The great thing about this (festival) program is it’s writing for performance — not limited to playwriting,” Decaul said. For example, a third-year MFA student created a hybrid of a board game and play for the festival last year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The event is organized by the Masters of Fine Arts in Playwriting, a program that accepts two students every year. These students work closely with Ehn and visiting faculty, who are often professional playwrights. Like the University at large, the program has few requirements and asks students to use the tools the program provides in pursuit of their own authentic voice, Ehn said. This enables an individualized progression over six semesters that aims to give students space to “become themselves in a more courageous and generous way,” Ehn said. Due to the incompleteness of the pieces, TAPS considers the program an exploration rather than a series of productions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Each class of MFA students is expected to produce something different. First-year students present a live reading of their scripts, called an articulation, while second-year students share an atelier, which incorporates elements of space and design into the performance. Third-year students produce an action, which is a collaboration with a theater in New York and does not occur until later in the semester.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This year’s Writing is Live featured four scripts, all in varying stages of completeness. Izumi’s performance, “Sometimes the Rain, Sometimes the Sea,” featured environmental activists, a cow, the Little Mermaid and a romance between a rain cloud and a human.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s been cool to watch people progress in the journeys of their pieces,” Izumi said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kyla Searle GS explored dialogue and scene structure in her articulation, “Residue,” which is impacted by her childhood in the Bay Area and background in dance, Ehn said. In Decaul’s articulation, “Honour,” he experimented with the interface of social media and traditional theatre, evoking questions about asylum in the United States. Beth Nixon GS, building off her background in activism and puppetry, tackled challenging questions about whiteness and the contemporary political climate in “The Ferry to the Isle of White.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Students in the MFA in Playwriting program<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>are “all family,” Ehn said. “I can write in a hole by myself but that’s not theatre,” Izumi said. The structure of Writing is Live reflects the program’s community-oriented approach to theater. The festival is “less about creating an object than about creating a conversation,” Ehn said. Following each production, the playwright gathered with faculty and organizers on stage to join in on an authentic conversation with the audience. Nixon implored the audience to speak openly about her work, making space to ask questions about themes present in her atelier, namely race and its presentation in art.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s a team sport” Ehn said. “We have got a good system.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the fringe of the financial district and tucked away in a building with vaulted ceilings, bright white walls and elegant gold trimmings, Knead Doughnuts has begun to satisfy the sweet tooth of Providence’s downtown denizens. The doughnut shop came on the scene after a soft opening in January. Now the store has fully opened to the public and is working to create a brand centered around tradition, community and quality.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Knead began as the brainchild of Bryan Gibb, a co-owner of the BOLT coffee chain, when he noticed the national artisan doughnut trend had not yet reached Providence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I had been kicking the idea around for a while, talking about it with friends,” Gibb said. “I started to build a team around it and got to bring doughnuts to the city.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The store strives to create a “timeless” and “approachable” product, Gibb said. With classic flavors such as glazed vanilla, chocolate cake and a few elegant novelties like Earl Grey and passion fruit, Knead does not subscribe to the quirky outlandishness of other contemporary doughnut houses. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The Boston Cream donut is my favorite,” said customer Blake Gerry. “It’s the best one I’ve ever had.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Knead also sells a small selection of coffee products by Native, a New York City-based roaster.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Knead partners with charity groups around Providence, providing doughnuts and donations for events such as school fundraisers, homeless shelters and nonprofits, such as the Izzy Foundation, a group that supports the families of children with chronic and debilitating illnesses. This spring, Knead will provide doughnuts for runners along the route of the Providence Marathon.</p>
<p class="p2">“The thing that we have is,” Gibb said. “It’s our medium. We can’t do it all, but we love giving back by doing the things we’re doing.”</p>
<p class="p2">The company’s doughnuts can also be found in BOLT Coffee’s two locations in Providence. Gibb’s experience with BOLT helped him to open Knead, but only to a certain degree.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Both of BOLT’s locations cohabitate with other businesses, so the building development side of Knead was new to me,” he said. “We couldn’t just bootstrap our way into it this time,” Gibb said, adding that he had to be thrifty while renovating the 32 Custom House St. location. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The location Gibb settled on is spacious and airy, with a window that lets patrons look directly into the kitchen, emphasizing Knead’s focus on community. “I love it here because it’s rarely crowded, the doughnuts are great and the staff is friendly,” said customer Jeannie Szykowny. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Marissa Roberson is one of those friendly staffers. “I love that we have the ability to work as a team to focus on one great product,” she said. “We try to create a vibe that’s uplifting and personal.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gibb, who has interest in urban planning and development, says he hopes to one day expand Knead to other brick-and-mortar locations, though nothing concrete is in the works yet.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Former trapeze artist joins U. through RUE program</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">At just 27 years old, Akaela “Kaely” Michels-Gualtieri ’20 has authored a children’s book, lived and studied in multiple countries and volunteered as an Emergency Medical Technician aboard ambulances in various cities. Perhaps most prominently, she has spent nearly twelve years touring the globe as a professional trapeze artist “living and breathing circus.” Now, Michels-Gualtieri has returned to academics as a first-year at Brown as part of the Resumed Undergraduate Education (RUE) program.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Internship turned gap year</b></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The February of her ninth grade year, Michels-Gualtieri interned at McDonalds — an internship that paved the way for her future career. “The next year, we were joking about what I should do to top McDonalds,” Michels-Gualtieri said. “I should join the circus!” Michels-Gualtieri recalled herself joking. “And my mom said, ‘That’s a great idea!’”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">So join the circus she did. Michels-Gualtieri’s mother discovered — or rather, established — an internship at a circus in San Francisco. “I would work in the daytime … and then at nighttime I could take any classes at the school that I wanted,” Michels-Gualtieri said. Though she had been a gymnast from a very young age, this internship was her first ever encounter with the art of trapeze.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Inspired and supported by her mother, Michels-Gualtieri decided to defer her acceptance to Wellesley College to continue pursuing her interests in circus performance. She represented the United States as the first American to study at a small school in Torino, Italy: the FLIC Scuola di Circo, or “FLIC Circus School,” an Olympic gymnastics training facility-turned educational institution.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Michels-Gualtieri moved to Torino, new suitcase in tow, “and was pretty much lost, solidly, for about four months.” But as the weeks and months passed, she found herself enjoying her new home more and more.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Gap year turned career</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">After spending a year in Torino and outgrowing FLIC’s resources, Michels-Gualtieri reached out to talented trapeze coach Alexander Doubrovski to help her reach the “next level” of aerial arts. Despite the fact that the only mutual language they shared — French — was the second language for both parties, Doubrovski agreed to receive Michels-Gualtieri as a student at the Parisian L’Academie Fratellini, one of the oldest circus schools in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Further deferring her college career, Michels-Gualtieri began her studies in Paris with support from France’s governmental funding for the arts. While in school, Michels-Gualtieri traveled to many different countries to perform, including France, Spain and Italy. “I got professional experience while being under the safety net of Fratellini.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Nevertheless, it wasn’t until her second year at Fratellini that Michels-Gualtieri began to seriously view circus performing as a potential career. And sure enough, she began receiving contract offers almost immediately after graduation. At the age of twenty-one, Michels-Gualtieri found herself abruptly launched into “this new career that nobody had planned for — it just kind of happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Life in the circus</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">During her career as a professional trapeze artist, Michels-Gualtieri performed with troupes such as the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>all across Europe, Asia and the Americas.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Life in the circus kept Michels-Gualtieri busy, but she made room for other pursuits as well. As a certified EMT, she regularly volunteered with emergency medical services while on tour. “From Monday to Wednesday, I would usually volunteer on an ambulance, no matter which city we were in — and we moved to a different city every week — and then from Thursday to Sunday I would perform,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">On one occasion, her medical expertise proved useful. A friend and fellow performer was seriously injured while rehearsing an act entitled the “Globe of Death” — a performance involving three motorcycles doing loops in an enormous metal sphere. Michels-Gualtieri, then a newly-certified EMT, was the most medically-knowledgeable person in the building; as such, she was put in charge of the situation until the paramedics arrived. Though the performer ultimately suffered only a few broken bones, Michels-Gualtieri described the incident as one of “the scariest” experiences she has had in the circus.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Michels-Gualtieri’s other wild circus experiences include a power outage during a trapeze act and a time when several circus animals were spooked and threw the act into disarray a mere twenty seconds before the curtain opened.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">How did Michels-Gualtieri’s family react to her newfound career? Unlike her mother, who was a staunch supporter from day one, some of her family members took issue with her career choice. “Not all of my family understood it or even thought it was an acceptable thing for me to be doing with my life,” Michels-Gualtieri said. But she remarked a significant “shift” when she announced that she had gotten into Brown: “All of a sudden, you (didn’t) have to just take the path that everybody wants you to take to end up at a place you want to be.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Back to school </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Despite her twelve-year break from academia, Michels-Gualtieri always intended to return to school. After nearly a decade in the circus, she realized that she had outgrown her trapeze career. “(Performing) just became sort of empty … I’d reached the level I wanted to be (at) and I felt like I didn’t have anything to work toward,” she said. “It was confusing, because on the one hand I felt incredibly lucky to have this job. (There are) three circus jobs in the world for people who can trapeze professionally, and I had one of them.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">She soon discovered the University’s RUE program and was drawn to Brown’s open curriculum. In September, twelve years after her move to Torino, she landed in Providence as part of the RUE Class of 2020 to study health and human biology.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Of course, the transition back to school hasn’t always been smooth. At first Michels-Gualtieri suffered from “imposter syndrome,” often comparing herself to other students in class who arrived at Brown straight out of high school. But she has since found solace through the services Brown provides to its RUE students — from office hours with RUE-specific deans to dinner with President Christina Paxson P’19 herself.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">She has also received support from her fellow RUE students — who, despite their small number, come from an extremely diverse array of backgrounds. “One of the most magical moments for me was our first orientation brunch,” she said. “We all sat in a big room with both deans, and everybody told their story. And everybody’s story is incredible in its own right.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Looking ahead</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Michels-Gualtieri still receives trapeze job offers. Most of the time she turns them down. This past winter break, however, she took the chance to tour in the Philippines — beginning to perform almost immediately after her last final exam. “I didn’t know if I would ever perform again when I decided to come to Brown,” Michels-Gualtieri said. “I was okay with it. And then I really started to miss it.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">All things considered, Michels-Gualtieri has gained a lot from her years in the circus. “One of the greatest joys of it is meeting people from all over the world,” she said. “I’ve had a very privileged life; I grew up in DC, I went to private school … but I’ve met people I never would have met under any circumstances, and I see the world in a completely different way than I would have otherwise,” she said. “I say jokingly I think everybody should join the circus. I actually really mean it.”</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Labels carry weight in Hollywood. They force actors, directors and writers into boxes that restrict their creative potential. But inherent in this labeling process is an understanding that these characterizations reflect merely impermanent and fluid narratives capable of renaissance and reconstruction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other labels are more difficult to shake in 2017. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences labeled Director Asghar Farhadi a cinematic visionary, nominating his film “The Salesman” for an Oscar in the ‘best foreign language film’ category. President Trump labeled Farhadi a threat to national security through his immigration ban. Farhadi is Iranian, and the Academy Awards ceremony occurs on Feb. 26. Do the math.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Various media outlets ran the controversy around Farhadi’s precense at the awards ceremony, and reports soon emerged that he could potentially attend by applying for a special exemption from Trump’s ban. The ban has recently been overruled by the Federal Court of Appeals, but Farhadi announced that he would boycott the Oscars, claiming: “The possibility of (my) presence is being accompanied by ‘if’s’ and ‘but’s,’ which are, in no way, acceptable to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The controversy surrounding Farhadi’s attendance highlights emerging tensions between Trump and the sphere of arts and culture. Initial returns on the Trump administration in this regard are not promising. Reports suggest that the president will consider cutting the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from the national budget. While such action is yet to come to fruition, Trump has already participated in a series of silencing attacks on opposing voices by firing acting Attorney General Sally Yates and placing a gag order on the Environmental Protection Agency. These moves speak to a dedication to censure and uniformity that is particularly frightening to artists, especially following eight years of the Obama presidency.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a recent article for the New York Times, Wesley Morris considered former President Barack Obama’s relationship to art and culture, writing: “Mr. Obama has always seemed to understand the importance of culture as a mirror, window, escape hatch and haven. The Obamas were catholic in their tastes not because they had to be, but because that’s what we should be: open.” Obama understood the White House to provide a platform that legitimized marginalized voices, and so he actively supported storytellers and narratives that drove contemporary conversations about race, class and gender. During his presidency, Obama screened films at the White House like “Lincoln” and “Selma,” and, more recently, Michelle Obama hosted the cast of “Hidden Figures” for a screening of the Oscar nominated film. Donald Trump’s first White House screening choice? “Finding Dory.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, there’s more to a presidency than its attention or aversion to marginalized communities in popular culture. But the U.S. is not so far removed from the days in which black and brown artists could not step foot inside the White House that we can disregard the artisitic narratives privileged by the president. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The choices of the Trump presidency will send shockwaves felt both in Hollywood and at the university level, particularly on campuses like Brown that enjoy both a strong cinematic and socially progressive presence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown Motion Pictures, the Ivy League’s largest student-run film production company, promotes an ideology that runs counter to Trump’s early moves as president.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s never been a more vital time to make art than at this moment,” said Ellie Gravitte ’17, a managing director of BMP. “I can speak for the board of BMP when I say we are really fortunate to be a producing body to help young voices make things to respond to the political climate.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">BMP enjoys a preeminent position on campus — the organization offers a platform for artists hoping to express their varying responses to the cultural climate under a Trump presidency. The Trump administration’s current relationship to the world of arts and culture only underscores the urgent need for independent organizations that encourage progressive thought. These independent bodies have an obligation to provide a platform for voices that have been further marginalized by the Trump administration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The most important thing that producing bodies on campus should do is to keep creating and keep writing,” Gravitte said, adding that she regards BMP as an ideal patron for this type of inclusive, student-based art.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brad Weekes ’17, a director of Brown University Film Forum, similarly understands the value of independent film organizations carrying on the diversity of perspective of the Obama administration. “It’s easy to say Obama helped create a liberal progressive environment, but it also came from people pushing into that space,” Weekes said. More films portrayed this progressivism because of “film societies, like the one at Brown, committing to, engaging with and responding to difficult ideas.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a screening collective, BUFF works to push into cultural discomfort, featuring films that are not only critically acclaimed and engaging but also reflect diversity in thought. In an attempt to distance itself from the Euro-centric<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>model of popular cinema, BUFF recently partnered with the Middle East studies department to sponsor a series of screenings highlighting films from regions in the Middle East. Actions such as these make BUFF a platform for both resistance and cinematic celebration. Groups like BUFF and BMP are natural heirs to the Obama legacy of supporting marginalized artistic voices.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Look at the films people are talking about: ‘Moonlight,’ ‘Fences,’ ‘Hidden Figures,’” Weekes said. “These films tackle things that are uncomfortable, like blatant racism and homophobia … Films ultimately can give voice to the voiceless and the ignored.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those who believe platforms for voices don’t matter, remember what happened to Leslie Jones. When Columbia Pictures announced that the black actress and Saturday Night Live standout would co-star in a female-led remake of “Ghostbusters,” Jones faced racially and sexually charged backlash for her inclusion in the cast. Alt-Right media personality, Milo Yiannopoulos, led a horde of Twitter trolls in an unprovoked attack against Jones so vitriolic that Yiannopoulos’ Twitter account was suspended. Yiannopoulos is an editor for the right-wing media outlet, “Breitbart,” which at the time of the attack was run by Steve Bannon, now Trump’s Chief Strategist and closest advisor. This story matters, even within the liberal bubble of Brown’s cultural community. Bannon offered a platform for Yiannopoulis’s voice. Trump then gave Bannon the largest platform in the country: the White House.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Next time you attend a BUFF screening or watch a BMP film, remember that something larger is at work here. These organizations move against a regressive current wrought by the Trump administration. The mere act of providing platforms for marginalized voices embraces an approach to art that is no longer mirrored by the White House. By supporting artistic spaces like BUFF and BMP that encourage inclusivity in both representation and expression, your actions can now take the form of resistance.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>AD2CART bitingly criticizes consumerism</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A critical look into online consumerism habits, “AD2CART” uses technology to tell the story of a man navigating his way through the ecosystem of the modern-day internet. The experimental performance took place last Friday as part of the master’s thesis project of Martim Galvão GS, a graduate student of the Multimedia and Electronic Music Experiments program.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We hoped to create the experience of a kind of humorous discomfort about the ways in which we succumb to these advertising elements in order to help construct an identity and ingrain in ourselves that we’re not enough,” said Kate Bergstrom GS, the director of “AD2CART” and a graduate student studying directing through the Brown/Trinity Rep MFA <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/15/writing-live-presents-works-progress-mfa-students/">program</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“AD2CART” combines various mediums to achieve this purpose, such as instruments, actors, lighting and computers that come to life. It tells the story of a regular man who is distracted by his web browser and ultimately wastes his time in the world of online shopping. Under the performance’s seemingly humorous and light appearance, “AD2CART” makes biting commentary about online consumerism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The narrative of the performance deals with algorithms dictating the ideal masculinity and selling identity, Bergstrom said. The computer is the only character in the performance that speaks, and it does so relentlessly — continuously chipping at the main character’s constraint and self-confidence in order to sell an idealized version of masculinity or the augmented “you.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The main character — the human one — never speaks but conveys his emotions through percussion, with rhythms occasionally denoting excitement and anticipation but mostly anxiety. “The drums are a way to bring in human presence to the piece, whereas everything (else) that’s happening is electronic,” Galvão said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The computers and instruments are the storytellers, rather than the people who are actually physically present, Bergstrom said. “We’re looking to bust into a new form where the acting is more of a puppeteering of these elements,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> When the Amazon package with the character’s purchases finally arrives, the stage explodes into bursts of colorful lights and the delivery man enters toting a red electric guitar. “The delivery person becomes the star — this person is giving you this experience that you’ve been looking forward to for a long time,” said Alexander Dupuis GS, a graduate student in the MEME program who played the delivery man.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The main character is ultimately disappointed with his purchases, which seemed inevitable insofar as online purchases cannot change who you are in the real world. The constant bombardment of ads on social media and the internet are selling pipe dreams.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The way that these data gathering platforms work (is that) they can always find a way to turn even resistance to brand marketing into a type of brand marketing. So you can sell that back to people,” Galvão said. The piece makes a point of acknowledging that even when the main character becomes aware of this vicious consumerist cycle he is trapped in, he cannot get out of it. The algorithms take note of his anti-capitalist interests and begin to advertise anti-consumerist merchandise that can be purchased on Amazon. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think the piece is still in progress,” said Bergstrom. “This is just our first crack at telling this story of inescapable capitalism in the sale of one’s identity.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Durk’s brings barbeque to Thayer Street</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/22/durks-brings-barbeque-thayer-street/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2017 04:04:32 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nestled among Thayer Street’s many attractions sits the newly installed and already-popular Durk’s Bar-B-Q restaurant, which has remained jam-packed since its opening earlier this semester.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Durk’s was brought to Thayer by Jake Rojas of student favorite Tallulah’s Taqueria, as well as Steve Durkee and Jay Carr, the minds behind another Providence food scene hub — The Eddy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The decoration of the elongated restaurant is that of a traditional barbecue joint reinterpreted by a Brooklynite hipster — consciously stylish, with deep colors and dark woods. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With sports-bar-type seating as well as sit-down dining, Durk’s offers a wide range of bourbons and whiskeys tempered with bitters, along with a sweet, unique selection of cocktails. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Due to its newly established popularity among East Side residents and the fact that it doesn’t take reservations, patrons at Durk’s may face a bit of a wait — but the delay is well worth the many offerings of brisket, pulled pork, ribs and cornbread that await patrons inside. In addition to the usual barbecue fixings, a full subsection of the menu features sandwiches, with traditional sausage, beef and pulled pork options as well as mixed-meat combination specialties like the “Ridurkulous,” a combination of chopped beef and sausage, and the “Dirty Durk,” made with sausage and pulled pork. Curious culinary offerings at first glance, both dishes present patrons with a unique, delicious twist complimented by potato bread buns.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The “Dirty Durk” was the most succulent and delectable of the mixed-meat bunch due to the authentic, hometown taste of its savory sauce. But the menu offers many hearty fan favorites, from the sausage to the pork ribs to the brisket. Durk’s dishes are well-seasoned, tender and perfectly flavored with the restaurant’s signature barbecue sauce, while pricey side dishes like moist, buttery cornbread, crunchy pork rinds, smoked sweet potatoes, crispy brussels sprouts and zesty pimento cheese bring a diverse range to an otherwise meat-heavy menu. Gooey mac’n’cheese, though offered as a side, had main-dish potential. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the food trended toward traditional Southern barbecue, the portion sizes did not. To the chagrin of the customer’s dollar, dishes often skimped on the nicely seasoned meats, and sandwiches in particular were more bread than meat. Additionally, the logistics of ordering proved awkward and cumbersome, as a representative from each dining group must scribble down orders on a form to hand to kitchen staff. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Overall, despite its shortcomings, Durk’s monopoly as the only restaurant on Thayer that offers an array of succulent, juicy slow-cooked barbecue meats is more than enough to keep its patrons coming back again and again.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Paterson” begins in the morning with the start of its titular character’s day. Paterson, played by Adam Driver, rolls over in bed and checks the time on his analog watch. White text spelling out “Monday” fades in slowly as Paterson gives his wife a kiss, eats Cheerios out of a glass cup, toys briefly with a small box of Ohio Blue Tip Matches and heads off to work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These actions may sound mundane, but director Jim Jarmusch imbues “Paterson” with such honesty and tenderness that even the most inconsequential events are compelling.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 14th feature film by the longtime indie director, “Paterson” was released in the United States Dec. 28, 2016 and is currently screening at Avon Cinema. The story takes place in Paterson, New Jersey and centers on the life of a full-time bus driver and part-time poet also named Paterson. Paterson lives with his wife Laura, an eccentric artist and aspiring musician played by Golshifteh Farahani, in a small house in the city. The film follows Paterson through one week of his life, chronicling the ups and downs of his job, relationships and financial struggles, as well as his ongoing pursuit of poetry.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Over the course of the film, the audience gains a sense of Paterson’s daily routine, from his regular drives down Route 23 to his nighttime walks to the nearby bar. Throughout the day, he makes time to jot down poems in his journal, or “Secret Notebook,” and Laura encourages him to publish them. Each day is a variation on the same pattern, and yet the movie never veers into monotony. Instead it highlights the beauty in day-to-day life via little details — a mailbox that never stands up straight, a red neon bar sign, sunlight falling in bright bands across a pillow. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Throughout the course of the film, as the audience adopts Paterson’s vantage point, these little details become more and more familiar. Objectively, the film progresses quite slowly, but the passage of time isn’t boring; rather, it feels as though the viewer is living life alongside Paterson, partaking sincerely in his personal joys and sorrows.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many know Driver as Kylo Ren, the angst-filled antagonist of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” Driver’s character in “Paterson” is much less flashy. Nonetheless, Driver demonstrates his range and pulls off the switch fantastically, depicting the young bus driver and poet with combined realism and sensitivity. Driver’s laugh is infectious and his portrayal of Paterson’s quiet emotional restraint is admirable. When tragedy strikes near the end of the film, Paterson’s unspoken sadness renders it all the more heartbreaking.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The rest of the cast, for the most part, mirrors Driver’s expertise. Barry Shabaka Henley portrays Doc, a chess-loving bartender with just the right amount of worldliness and compassion, while Masatoshi Nagase makes the most out of a brief appearance as a poet who offers Paterson some helpful literary advice. Farahani’s performance as Laura, meanwhile, is occasionally stiff but mostly charming; she delivers her lines with an innocent and lively goodwill that makes up in sweetness all it lacks in depth. Admittedly — and through no fault of Farahani’s — Laura’s character is somewhat two-dimensional, giving the actress little to work with; she mostly exists to serve as Paterson’s muse.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The film’s cinematography is charmingly simple. There are neither glamorous panoramas nor melodramatic close-ups, and camera movement barely occurs. The soundtrack consists mostly of background noise, filling each scene with an unobtrusive, believable atmosphere that emphasizes the many long pauses throughout the film.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Contrary to its intimate promotional poster, which features Driver and Farahani lying together in bed, “Paterson” isn’t a romance movie. But it is about love — a deeply founded love for people, poetry and the city of Paterson itself. This love is present in each scene and, moreover, it’s present in the details: from each affectionate interaction between Paterson and Laura to each line tha</span><span class="s2">t Paterson composes in his “Secret No</span>tebook.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wayland ’18: ‘Best Animated Short’ warrants your attention</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sandwiched between a commercial break and a lifetime achievement prize, the “Best Animated Short” award merits little attention from the ABC executives responsible for planning the Academy Awards. The lack of exposure primarily reflects the category’s inability to drum up interest amongst Oscar viewers as compared to the awards for acting, directing and “best picture.” Nonetheless, the hierarchy of award positioning also speaks to which forms of cinema film-goers privilege as artistically consequential.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this regard, the animated short genre suffers on two fronts. Often condescendingly deemed a “children’s genre” unworthy of serious attention, animated films lack the critical prestige granted to “best picture” nominees. Likewise, short films are disparaged for their length, seen as incapable of producing the kind of rich world-building and expository detailing of long-form cinema.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both characterizations reflect narrow-mindedness. Rather than </span>limiting potential, animation frees creative minds to plumb uncharted domains of their imagination. For example, “Spirited Away” and “Up,” which both previously won “Best Animated Feature,” not only offer two of the most impressive cinematic experiences of the 21st century but also are unparalleled in their originality. Additionally, full-length features don’t require the constant attention to detail demanded of short films. “La La Land” can be forgiven for a scene that falls flat, while any significant misstep in an eight-minute short spells death. Thus, celebrating animated shorts provides more than just an entertaining reprieve from more “serious” film analysis — it shines a light on an under-appreciated medium.</p>
<p class="p2">Of this year’s crop of Oscar-nominated animated shorts, Pixar’s “Piper” stands out as a clear favorite, and is therefore most worthy of attention. Written and directed by Alan Barillaro, the film follows a formative moment in the life of a baby sandpiper as it learns to hunt mussels buried in the sand. Using photorealistic animation techniques, Barillaro paints his beach setting in such stunning and vivid detail that viewers could be forgiven for mistakenly believing the short was filmed rather than constructed on a computer screen. The other four nominated shorts explore more complex plots, but none approach their subjects with the care and emotional attention that “Piper” does. Barillaro understands that animation expands the theater of the imagination, and “Piper” not only captures the minutiae of the natural world but also the poetry of its rhythms. The film is in many ways a ballet — the sweeping musicality of the sandpipers’ forward-and-back dance with the incoming tide is exceptional in its charm and artistry.</p>
<p class="p2">“Piper” also meticulously embraces the scope of its protagonist’s world — an innocuous wave inspires unadulterated terror, and a clump of seaweed offers suitable refuge from the water’s danger. In perhaps the film’s strongest moment, the baby sandpiper finds itself beneath the surface of a small tide washing ashore. The tide wouldn’t reach the height of a human’s ankles, but “Piper” understands it as a portal of imaginative discovery, a window into a vibrant world teeming with life.</p>
<p class="p2">Certainly, “Piper’s” message of self-sufficiency and courage lacks the poignancy of other Oscar nominees, such as “Moonlight,” which presents a radical commitment to celebrating black humanity. But in its ability to perfectly execute the pulsating and musical energy of a diminutive environment, “Piper” stands as a work of artistry worthy of attention and praise.</p>
<p class="p2">“Piper” is not alone in meriting critical acclaim as an animated short. “Pearl” delivers a similarly simple plot, following a father-daughter relationship as they travel the country in a hatchback. While lacking “Piper’s” realism, “Pearl” uses Google’s 360 Spotlight Storytelling to push the boundaries of cinema and fully immerse viewers in the visual experience. Similarly, “Blind Vaysha,” “Borrowed Time” and “Pear Cider and Cigarettes,” despite their faults, rise to the quality of imaginative storytelling present in most best picture nominations.</p>
<p class="p2">In one of the Oscars’ rare quiet moments, a pair of Hollywood elites will come on stage to condescendingly introduce stories about cute little birds, family roadtrips and three other narratives unworthy of critical acclaim. If you’ve muted your television by then, turn the volume up for just a moment when the eventual winners come on stage to give their speeches. These films deserve your attention, too.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Youth Poetry Grand Slam addresses race, sexuality through spoken word</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poetry is best when it speaks loudly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That’s what happened Thursday night at the 2017 Youth Poetry Grand Slam at AS220 where poetry echoed off the walls and checkered stage, splashed against the red curtains and landed with impact into the ears of listeners cramped closely on folding metal chairs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The slam included eight contestants under the age of 19, all of whom performed original spoken-word poems to compete for five spots on the Providence Brave New Voices team. The New Voices team will be trained by poet-coaches this summer and compete in the annual Brave New Voices International Youth Poetry Festival in Oakland, Calif.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This slam was more than just a competition — it was a stand-alone exposition of race, religion, sexuality, politics, identity and personal experience told through the diverse voices of Providence youth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First to perform was Charlotte Abotsi, co-director of Providence Poetry Slam and the night’s emcee, who introduced the organization and set the tone for the night. She opened with a poem beginning with “My pediatrician taught me to hate my body,” which explored coming to terms with her body and the appropriation of black women’s physical features.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Black identity was the focal point of poems by several other “sacrificial poets” — past Brave New Voices team members who performed in order to prepare the “five random as fuck judges we plucked from the audience” for scoring the upcoming student performances, Abotsi said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Sin Seven, one the sacrificial poets, twisted Edgar Allen Poe’s famous poem “The Raven” to dissect America’s prison-industrial complex. “Maybe we’ve been saved from shackles, but we’re still in cuffs,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Seth, a past poet-coach, explored the racist undertones of football and the important political lessons that young “black and brown boys” can learn from the sport. “They never wanted those black boys to win — and that’s an analogy for life,” Seth said, referring to the Panther’s loss in the Superbowl.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The student competitors continued the tone. “Citizens, the White House is in need of renovation,” said Gemini, the first contestant, who rapped rhythmically, nonchalantly tossing written notes to the floor as he walked onstage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Other performers also expressed political unease, including “B,” who asked, “America, how can I be proud of you?” after beginning one a poem with a skeptical rendition of the pledge of allegiance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Funny how anonymity is a synonym for black struggle,” said Blessed Sheriff ’19 in a powerful poem about Anarcha, the victim of hundreds of medical experiments and operations by the “Father of Gynecology” Marion Sims. Sims’ legacy is remembered in statues and history books, but the story of Anarcha, the slave whose body led to his discoveries, is not.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The Providence Poetry Slam itself is charged with politics — it is funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which the Trump administration has threatened to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/arts/nea-cuts-trump-arts-reaction.html?_r=0">defund</a>, Abotsi noted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Other poems were less political and more personal, focusing on struggles with sexuality and the ramifications of identity in an unaccepting society. Alyssa performed poems on her identity — unapologetically black and gender-fluid. Keely presented a list of “ten things I’d like to ask my boyfriend’s parents,” which began powerfully with “when your son told you he wasn’t a girl...” and went on to discuss the depression incurred by having an identity that is ostracized by parents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Depression was a topic that received multiple platforms that night — shattering the silence around an issue often kept in the dark.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Life’s about sadness sometimes,” said Jazlyn, who performed a poem about feeling trapped in the city of Providence, where the skyline can feel like unconquerable walls. Cleo too showed the strength in vulnerability, admitting “I’ve been dead for a while now” in a poem about reluctance to share poetry.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Religion — specifically its relation to sexuality — was also a central theme of the night, sometimes acting as a societal villain and sometimes as a source of hope. While Gemini rapped, “Does God forgive? It ain’t hard to ask,” “B” commented that “your hungry God was eating me alive” in a poem about reluctan</span><span class="s1">tly attending church as a child.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the end of the night, scores were added and the newest members of the Brave New Voices slam team were announced: Alyssa, “B,” Jazlyn, Cleo and Blessed, who won the coveted title of Grand Slam Champion. It is the first Brave New Voices team composed of entirely “black and brown girls,” noted Chrysanthemum Tran ’16, who will coach the team.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rather than giving each artist a rating, the night should be remembered for the art produced, Abotsi noted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This is a very vulnerable place to be in,” she said. “Applaud the poet, not the score.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In addition to youth slams, Providence Poetry Slam organizes events on the first and third Thursday of every month at AS220. Events include open mics, feature performances by visiting artists, youth workshops and competitive poetry slams for all ages.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Providence band Low Anthem’s Jeff Prystowsky ’06 had just sat down for a slice of pizza when he noticed an interesting-looking building through the window. Curious, he went up to the door and sleuthed around to find its owner. After some calls around town, Prystowsky found the building’s owner, John Berberian PhD’68 P’93 P’97, who offered to give him a tour. He learned that he had not happened upon just any old building: 270 Broadway had a story.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Berberian had owned the Columbus Theater since the 1960s, working to maintain the building, which still housed equipment from when it opened in the 1920s. Throughout its long history, the theater had accumulated evidence of multiple decades of performances — ranging from opera to porn. It was like “walking into a timewarp,” said Ben Knox Miller ’06, Prystowsky’s friend and bandmate and a Columbus Theater co-op member.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the members of Low Anthem met Berberian five years ago, they had been storing their equipment in an attic, Miller said. The band needed a new space for storage and to record their latest album, “Eyeland.” They thought the inoperative theater would work perfectly — besides, it had “the best acoustics in Providence,” Miller added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">New Rhode Island fire regulations put in place after the Station nightclub fire in 2003 had forced Berberian to shut down the Columbus for three years. When approached by the members of Low Anthem, Berberian offered to make the necessary investment for the license if the band would run the theater and plan a benefit show to raise money. Low Anthem rallied with local bands and got members of Providence’s music community involved to raise money for the both the theater and Atraves, a Providence-based nonprofit working for education, health and development in Nicaragua. During the process, they found more volunteers and formed the foundations of a music co-op.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The roles for each member came naturally, Prystowsky said, describing the consensus-based process of managing the bar, doing community outreach and working on overall planning. Because of the background many of the co-op members have in music, they have a way of “just being in touch with the artist experience.” Prystowsky noted that when John C. Reilly, known for his role in movies such as “Step Brothers,” “Wreck it Ralph” and “Guardians of the Galaxy,” performed at the theater, he compared the Columbus to “inmates running the asylum.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think the thing that sets us apart is having musicians involved in the operation,” said Tom Weyman, a co-op member with a background in management. “There’s a level of understanding when a band comes to the theater.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The theater means a lot to us. It’s a special place — a lot of historic theaters tend to … get snatched up by a giant company and turned into something else. We want to keep it special,” Weyman said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The co-op manages without corporate involvement, Prystowsky said. Since 2011, they have put on about 400 shows, in addition to growing as a community resource with student internships and music lessons.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prystowsky, who studied American history and music in his time at Brown, sees the theater as a bridge, creating a space to apply his theoretical studies at Brown to a practical and political platform. “If you put on a show with a political tinge, you might get protestors and you might get people who are supportive,” he said. Last Sunday, Native American singer-songwriter Buffy Sainte-Marie played at the Columbus, bringing the “No DAPL” movement to center stage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If you dream it, you can make it come true,” Prystowsky said, describing the five-year endeavor that started with a slice of pizza. “It should have become a … parking lot. If you have people who care about it, put their heart in it, things have a chance to live on.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Art of Dining’ brings theater to Ratty</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/28/art-dining-brings-theater-ratty/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dry chicken breasts weren’t the only thing being cut in the Ratty this weekend — but scenes were, too.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Shakespeare on the Green theater troupe put on Tina Howe’s 1979 “The Art of Dining,” directed by Paul Martino ’17. The play was performed not on stage but in the Sharpe Refectory, in one of the auxiliary dining rooms on the side of the main cafeteria. The room was set up like a restaurant, with white-clothed tables, merry-go-round centerpieces, a functional kitchen with real food and a sound system. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The setup evoked a Jersey Shore restaurant operated by married couple Cal and Ellen, played by Judson Ellis ’19 and Talia Brenner ’19, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Cal used to be a lawyer. He was a really educated guy,” Ellis said, describing his character. “After eight years of running a successful business, he quit to start a restaurant with his wife in their living room. He has stakes in the financial aspect, and tends to freak out about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indeed, much of the play’s humor in the early scenes came from the mile-a-minute concurrent diatribes shouted by Cal and Ellen to one another. Cal, preoccupied with paying off the restaurant’s loans, obsesses over getting as many people into the restaurant as possible. Ever the gourmand, Ellen favors quality over quantity and savors each bite of her high-end preparations. In the hilariously awkward opening scene, Cal and Ellen spend several minutes eating poached pears, moaning and contorting their faces in ecstasy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The audience is right in the center of action, seated at tables in the middle of the room. As the restaurant’s patrons arrive, they are seated around the fringe of the room, creating the feeling that the audience and characters are really mingling at adjacent tables at a restaurant. First to arrive are Hannah and Paul Galt, an over-the-top hipster couple played by Kristina Belyakova ’19 and Haley Wong ’20. They compete over who has the best taste in food and, ironically, which of them is able to eat the least and feel satiated.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the heart of the play are the characters’ relationships with food. “The Art of Dining” tackles the topic of eating disorders with a firm but gentle hand, with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>insinuations that are unsubtle but unostentatious. Characters deal with stress eating, binge eating, bulimia, body dysmorphia and other strained relationships with food. Even Ellen focuses on her haute cuisine with an unhealthy obsession. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The most obvious and heart-wrenching depiction of eating disorder comes in the form of Elizabeth Barrow-Colt, a neurotic writer played brilliantly by Ali Murray ’18. Elizabeth comes to the restaurant to meet a publisher who wants to print a collection of her short stories, but her anxiety turns her into a nervous wreck. The show plays the long game with her backstory, revealing bit-by-bit how her stressful childhood left her with a fear of food and kitchens. With each revelation, the audience’s hearts break just a little more. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After some more funny shenanigans and dramatic pas de deux, the production’s cathartic finale brings all the characters together in the center of the room for dessert. They share a pan full of crepes suzette — a dish famously and deliciously invented by accident. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Notable is the play’s use of real food (and real eating), prepared meticulously by Brenner’s Ellen when the action is elsewhere in the restaurant. Brenner said she drew on her knowledge of cooking shows to prepare herself for the role. “I watch a lot of Food Network,” she said. “Nothing makes a plate look fancier than random condiment smeared on the rim.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown Dining restrictions meant that the food the characters were eating was cold, and Brenner was not allowed to use a real knife when preparing the dishes. “I had to use the side of a cheese grater,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ellis joined the cast late, replacing the original Cal, who had suffered an injury, and learned his lines and many monologues in just two weeks. “The hardest part was definitely learning all of my lines in such a short span of time,” he said. “But I have a lot of friends in Shakespeare on the Green, and they were all really supportive.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Michael O’Neill ’19 was in attendance. “It’s definitely one of the most dynamic shows I’ve seen at Brown,” he said. “It managed to transition from hilarious to heartbreaking without a hitch, which is something only the best directors, actors and actresses can pull off.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The play also starred Samantha Crausman ’18, Liesl Jaeger ’18, Ani Mack ’17 and Ben Morris ’20, along with Gail, who poked her head in for a bit.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Performances reevaluate Western canon by highlighting female authors</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Explosions from the Other Canon” burst onto the scene Friday and Saturday night at the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. The eclectic collection of shows was curated by Kate Bergstrom GS, a graduate student from the Trinity/Brown program.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The performances were consciously alternative, deliberately daring and invariably powerful. Actors or curators themselves chose pieces that stood for something outside the ordinary. This was a show with a mission: to explode the traditional Western cannon with counter-narratives, Bergstrom said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Male writers have dictated the way that we see and perceive our cultural narrative today,” she said. Bergstrom first thought of the idea of creating “Explosions from the Other Canon” when she read an article by Susan Jones in the American Theater Magazine, which listed a compilation of unproduced plays by women dating from 700 A.D. to the 1970s. As Bergstrom perused this list, she realized she had never been taught over 80 percent of the pieces. Instead, traditional education systems emphasized male writers such as William Shakespeare, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There have been silent voices for hundreds of years of women who made stabs at creating counter-narratives,” Bergstrom said. To give these plays the attention she felt they deserved, Bergstrom commissioned artists from multiple disciplines to study these pieces and voice them in their own particular fashion. The performing artists came from a wide range of backgrounds, including multimedia and electronic music experiments, theater and music. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The performances featured a wide range of media, including music, actors, video and spoken word poetry. On stage, fruit was smashed to bits and names of victims of police brutality were solemnly written on a large scroll of paper. A letter by African American playwright Lorraine Hansberry was passionately read aloud. Another piece alluded to cooking shows as a comment on women’s struggle to find their place in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Feminist pedagogy is about standpoint epistemology, which means coming from all different standpoints and perspectives to take a look at an event or a story,” Bergstrom said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Explosions from the Other Canon” not only successfully confronted the viewer with traditionally unheard voices, but also strived to create a new theatrical experience — one that is entirely interdisciplinary and interconnected. Each of the pieces originated from an unproduced play and added to the new canon the show attempted to create.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The performances — while all inspired by historical pieces — were heavily influenced by contemporary concerns and interpretations. The artists seem to have studied and digested the original pieces and performed variations of the works based on their studies. As such, the show paid homage to the written work so long brushed aside by the traditional idea of theater, while still linking the pieces to today’s world such that they remained relevant.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The show strove to embrace the idea of the interdisciplinary. “Explosions from the Other Canon” counters the idea that artists need to restrict themselves to merely being a painter, actor, musician or director. “The eclectic group of artists and audience interacting with one another is in and of itself a counter-narrative to the very rigid forms that we are placed under in an institution,” Bergstrom said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The chic vegan eatery by CHLOE will open its doors to the Providence community summer 2017 at 223 Thayer Street, a location formerly occupied by Au Bon Pain. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Providence location joins two Boston venues in by CHLOE’s recent set of ventures into the New England market: One opened last week in Boston’s Seaport District, and another is slated to open in Boston’s Fenway neighborhood later this spring. Based out of Manhattan, the restaurant has risen to popularity in both Los Angeles and its native New York due to its exceptional commitment to taste and health. Catering to a health-conscious demographic, the eatery’s entirely vegan menu embodies the company’s progressive values.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The eatery is the brainchild of Chloe Coscarelli, champion of the Food Network’s “Cupcake Wars.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With just one visit to the hub location in Manhattan’s West Village, it’s obvious that her new<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>casual spot has no problems pulling in business, despite it being the restaurant group ESquared Hospitality’s first quick-service eatery. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Like most of the borough the eatery calls home, it’s densely packed. Menus line each inch of the wall and customers trail out the door. Even toddlers seem to delight in scarfing down handfuls of by CHLOE’s sweet potato french fries, a staple of the eatery’s wildly inventive recipes. Chia pudding, kelp noodles and a broad range of veggie burgers fill the menu, satiating customers’ healthy palette and cravings for a varied, nutritious and ultimately affordable meal. And with locally sourced ingredients devoid of artificial flavors and added preservatives, patrons can be sure to finish their meals with a clean conscience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“By CHLOE has a health-conscious, sustainable values system that’s consistent with what we hope to attract on Thayer,” said John Luipold, the University’s vice president of real estate. Unlike the post office and the building soon to house <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/01/insomnia-cookies-open-thayer-street/">Insomina Cookies</a>, by CHLOE’s Thayer Street location is not owned by the University. Even so, Luipold lauded its arrival to the University’s closest commercial strip.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many students are also excited about the arrival of by CHLOE and eagerly anticipate its opening. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s nice to have more diverse cuisine on Thayer that’s distinctive from the usual fare of pizza and calzones,” Calista Shang ’20 said. “It’s so refreshing to see something healthy for a change.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Others mentioned how the restaurant will fit with their dietary restrictions. In addition to being vegan and using fresh ingredients, by CHLOE maintains a commitment to supplying a 100 percent Kosher diet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m overjoyed that it’s Kosher-certified,” Cameron Chaleff<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>’20 said. “Now, I finally have a place to eat besides the Ratty.” The restaurant’s offerings similarly cater to gluten-free, nut-free and soy-free diets. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Exhibit highlights religious, intellectual life of Spanish convent women</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Illuminating the quotidian reality of a dynamically intellectual group, “Women of the Page: Convent Culture in the Early Modern Spanish World” showcases a collection of portraits, engravings, objects and manuscripts. The exhibition gives voice to devout, early modern Spanish and Latin American women who were often misrepresented as static and inexpressive.</p>
<p class="p2">On display at the John Carter Brown Library, “Women of the Page” was curated by Tanya Tiffany, associate professor of art history at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and former JCB research fellow. The exhibit opened in early February with a roundtable discussion and will be on display through mid-April.</p>
<p class="p2">Tiffany’s work “brings together visual culture and the Hispanic world to reveal the spaces and roles women occupied in convent life,” said Neil Safier ’91, associate professor of history and director and of the JCB. The exhibition is “a great opportunity to peer into a world not only unknown to us but also to those who lived during the period it represents.”</p>
<p class="p2">Six display cases comprise the exhibition: “Representing Nuns,” “Journeys,” “Divine Love,” “Nourishing Body and Soul,” “Sacred Images” and “Wealth and Rank.” Each reflects elements of female empowerment and intellectualism characteristic of the convent environment.</p>
<p class="p2">One engraving, “The Hieronymite Nun, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz” (1700), designed by Joseph Caldevilla and engraved by Clemens Puche, captures these qualities. Surrounded by laurel leaves, famed Mexican poet Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz is depicted holding a pen and a book, suggesting her intellectual force and prestige as a writer.</p>
<p class="p2">As Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz’s portrayal demonstrates, “convents were active spaces of intellectual construction,” Safier said. “Women’s ideas were tested, challenged and created in the course of daily life.”</p>
<p class="p2">Similarly demonstrating women’s mobility and active intellectual curiosity, “True Portrait of the Venerable Mother Gerónima de la Asunción” by Joseph Mota (1713) captures the likeness of Gerónima de la Asunción, who is famed for her year-and-a-half long journey from Toledo to the Philippines, where she founded the nation’s first women’s convent. The emaciated Gerónima de la Asunción is accompanied by images of a whip, chains and a crown made of thorns, representing the “extreme penitential practices that were praised during this period,” Tiffany said.</p>
<p class="p2">Gerónima de la Asunción’s likeness inspired Tiffany when she was writing a book on the artwork of esteemed painter Diego Velázquez. With a background in European art, Tiffany continued her research at Brown as a JCB fellow between 2014 and 2015, working with experts to study nuns from the Spanish world.</p>
<p class="p2">Other elements of the collection provide more whimsical representations of convent culture. In an inscription in her “Oaxaca Manuscript,” María de San José apologizes for the fact that the pages are stained, as a cup of hot chocolate had been spilled onto the pages. “It’s a neat, novel window into the world of the 17th century,” Tiffany said.</p>
<p class="p2">With almost all displayed items coming from Brown’s resources, the exhibition has succeeded in showcasing the exceptional depth of the JCB archives, said Tara Kingsley, the JCB’s coordinator of academic programming and public outreach.</p>
<p class="p2">“This exhibition sheds light on aspects of the JCB’s collection that we don’t usually think of,” Tiffany said. “It’s relevant because it helps us engage with women’s history while thinking broadly about Spanish culture.”</p>
<p class="p2">It captures “global women’s issues in the 17th century and recognizes a lot of work that is done by women and is not … recognized as it should be,” Safier said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rennie Harris Puremovement takes stage in Providence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Laughter and talk filled Providence’s Veterans Memorial Auditorium — known as the VETS — last Friday as over a thousand people crowded into the theater to see one of the nation’s most celebrated street dance performance groups: Rennie Harris Puremovement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Founded and led by famed choreographer Lorenzo “Rennie” Harris, the company came to Providence as part of FirstWorks’ Artistic Icons Series, performing a suite of eight works collectively entitled “Nuttin’ But A Word.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The saying “Nuttin’ But A Word” means that “words dissipate (and don’t) mean anything. I’m going to show you some action,” Harris said. The suite is “not really about anything specific, other than showing physically how this movement translates onstage.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Backed by the dramatic lighting of the VETS stage, 10 members of Puremovement effortlessly glided in and out of complicated configurations, moving in flawless synchronization to a mix of house, funk and R&amp;B music. Though movements varied from languid to frantically energetic, the dancers consistently maintained a powerful intensity. The suite melded various genres of street dance: dancers b-boyed, popped and locked. They executed backflips, spins and freezes. Every so often, after a particularly impressive sequence, the audience would break into cheers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(My work is) all inspired by my childhood,” Harris said. “My process is really simple. … I create a major phrase of choreography, and then I deal with singing and blocking, and then I deal with character …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and then I deal with production last.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He added that the key to any great performance is sincerity. “I’m not going to make a dance about the election just because the election was tumultuous. I’m not going to make a piece about Michael Jackson just because he died,” he said. “I’m not inspired — it’s not sincere. Sincerity means you do it from your heart … your spirit is moved to create.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Puremovement was founded in 1992 when Harris received a commission request to create 45-minute piece of choreography. Harris, who at the time was studying to become a priest, viewed the request as an excellent opportunity to earn money while also doing something he enjoyed. More people kept booking his performances, and before long, Puremovement had “just … evolved into a company,” Harris said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Contrary to popular belief, “hip-hop” is not Puremovement’s only dance style. “(People) usually use ‘hip-hop’ as an umbrella term, but it’s actually wrong,” Harris said. In reality, street dancing has a long and complex history, stretching back into the mid-20th century. Hip-hop is merely one subcategory; others include but are not limited to popping, locking, b-boying or breaking, krumping and turfing, Harris said. “If I was just using hip-hop, I think I would be limited and wouldn’t be able to do what I’m doing,” Harris added. Instead, he pulls from various sectors of street dance’s diverse repertoire to use in his work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moreover, Puremovement is not purely a performance group; the company is also actively involved in street dance education and outreach — offering programs such as workshops and mentorships across the nation. Harris visited Brown’s campus Feb. 26 and Feb. 27 to participate in the Rhythm of Change Festival, an annual festival held on campus that celebrates African diasporic dance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The festival, which took place from Feb. 23 through Feb. 26, aimed to “bring together people who are invested and involved in art and social change … people who are stepping outside the normative to bring communities together,” said Michelle Bach-Coulibaly, professor of theatre arts and performance studies and founder and artistic director of Rhythm of Change. This year, the festival focused on hip-hop in particular as a “world-expressive art form that … (permeates) every culture,” Bach-Coulibaly said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This year’s theme also featured a “subtitle”: “Dancing Difference: Moving Across Our Divides.” Through the festival, participants worked to take responsibility for their own “privilege (and) resources” in order to help bridge national, financial and political divides. Puremovement, along with other recognized individuals and groups such as Director for the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America Tricia Rose, Daniel Banks and Ana “Rokafella” Garcia, came to Brown to teach classes, give talks and promote education surrounding African diasporic dance and other forms of performance art.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">FirstWorks also collaborated with Brown to organize this year’s Rhythm of Change festival. Originally an outgrowth of FirstNight Providence — the city’s annual New Year celebration, FirstWorks was founded to “keep the idea of access of the arts that a festival has … but to also reach youth, and to be doing projects with artists that really affected our whole community,” said Kathleen Pletcher, founder and executive artistic director of FirstWorks. The organization works with artists of all mediums to bring art to the Providence community, in the form of classes, workshops, performances and festivals — similar to Rhythm of Change.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s nothing that brings people together quite as much as a shared experience in performance,” Pletcher said, adding that Harris “is an extraordinary artistic voice and vision … (I’m) so inspired by having him here.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The debacle of Sunday’s Academy Awards best picture award was a fitting conclusion to a category so fraught with tension this Oscars season. Over the past few months, the two-horse race between “La La Land” and “Moonlight” has become so overlaid with political consciousness that a victory for either film would have felt like a validation of one worldview over another rather than a celebration of artistry. It was only natural that the Academy Awards presenters did not even announce the correct best picture winner. The producers of “Moonlight” suffered the indecency of stepping on stage after the producers of “La La Land” accepted an award that rightfully belonged to “Moonlight”. The film’s victory should have represented a <span class="s1">tonic — but in place of catharsis, there was only exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">President Trump was elected Nov. 8, but the trauma experienced by those he marginalized during his campaign lingers. For many, Trump’s election mirrored regression in civil society, an attack on the liberal values that former President Barack Obama had imbued with a sense of permanence during his eight years in office. As a result, those experiencing the anti-Trump sentiment permeating much of our country have begun to interpret random post-election events through the binary prism of political and social progression or regression. This bifurcation reflects a response to political trauma, expressing our desperate urge to understand events across the entire spectrum of civil society as politicized responses. These responses can either represent a corrective to the retrograde nature of Trump’s vision or the mainstream legitimation of his worldview.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pop culture events have provided a stage on which to reproduce electoral trauma as a therapeutic exercise. In the buildup to the Super Bowl, fans and the media painted the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons along a binary. The Patriots, with their extensive personal connections to Trump, played the regressive antagonist, while the Falcons, representing an underdog city with a large black population, were lauded as the tolerant champion of liberals. The actual game played out similarly to the election: Despite nursing a 25-point lead (at which point they had a 99.7 percent win probability), Atlanta lost in overtime to the Patriots.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The best album award at the Grammys experienced similar framing. Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” served as the magnum opus from an artist who has consistently empowered women, especially women of color, throughout her career. Critics celebrated her album’s exploration of grief, rage and reconciliation as a vastly superior creative accomplishment to Adele’s “25,” which was widely accepted as a strong though unexceptional pop album. Adele’s victory released an explosive and painful response on the internet. Again, Trump’s particular brand of white nationalism had supposedly triumphed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The culmination of these cultural events and the post-electoral traumas they induced only added further weight to the Academy Awards’ best picture race. While “Moonlight” topped most year-end critical charts, “La La Land” enjoyed its status as the massive favorite to win best picture. And while “Moonlight” explored the life of a young, gay black man, “La La Land” reveled in Hollywood pastiche. Undergirding the awards process was a fear that the Oscars’ primarily white voting body — much like that of the Grammys — might not reflect popular opinion, in a manner akin to that of </span><span class="s2">the electoral college.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Popular interest fueled the politically polarized weight of the best picture race, yet neither film showed any interest in making the collective stage a battleground. Indeed, films, albums and even teams that occupy shared cultural spaces rarely reflect the severe dichotomy inherent in the electoral process. Assigning political values to art reflects a response to trauma rather than any legitimate labeling act. Furthermore, particularly in the case of “Moonlight” and “La La Land,” foisting this type of extreme baggage upon two competitors undermines rational discourse that addresses the subtler forms of marginalization that occurred in the awards process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perhaps a more productive exercise in moral evaluation can be found not in a political binary but in assessing the casually “benign” forms of racism at play during Sunday’s Academy Awards. There was Justin Timberlake, a white singer performing a hit by Bill Withers, shouting out mid-song to Denzel Washington, “I know you know thi</span><span class="s2">s, Denzel!” Then, there was Jimmy Kimmel making fun of the name of “Moonlight” star and best supporting actor winner Mahershala Ali. Sunday’s Academy Awards were like the kind of person who recognizes the atrocities of slavery but is blind to the white privilege born out of that history. “Moonlight,” with its black cast and challenge to the toxic historical hypersexualization and dehumanization of black masculinity, has to navigate a cultural sphere that at times proves ignorant to the history of inequity that informs the film’s existence and meaning.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After winning best supporting actress, Viola Davis gave an impassioned call for telling the stories of marginalized voices, saying: “You know, there’s one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered. One place, and that’s the graveyard. People ask me all the time, ‘What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?’ And I say, exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories.” Moonlight dared to exhume the bodies of buried voices. The privilege of “La La Land” is that it didn’t have to resurrect those buried voices. Award ceremonies and other popular culture events don’t have to split along the extremes of the recent electoral binary to be political.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A small gathering of students, employees and Providence locals played host to a shift in the landscape of College Hill Monday afternoon — Insomnia Cookies has opened on 307 Thayer Street, across from Blue State Coffee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yesterday’s ribbon cutting ceremony officially introduced the highly anticipated business to College Hill. Insomnia delivers cookies in flavors ranging from s’mores to white chocolate macadamia, along with other desserts until 2 a.m. Some of their specialties include “’wiches” made from cookies and ice cream, as well as brownies and cookies a la mode, with toppings and mix-ins available for a personalized dessert experience. Nick Lorence ’19, one of the few Brown students in attendance at the 11:55 a.m. ceremony, said he is looking forward to “more ways to ruin my diet at two in the morning.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The ceremony itself involved a group of employees poised with a giant pair of scissors, ready to cut a bright red ribbon. A few people present discussed the feasibility of the giant scissors industry. Others considered flavors and discussed their plans to make the best possible use of the new business. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The crowd patiently waited through the prolonged photo shoot of the ribbon fluttering in front of the gray building. Then, after the ribbon-cut had been sufficiently documented, the crowd scrambled for the door.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Naomi Altman ’19 had been sitting in class when a friend texted her to come to the event. She said she had to rush from her 11 a.m. class to make it into the inaugural line for Insomnia Cookies. “This is going to be the go-to place,” she said, adding that she looked forward to grabbing herself a chocolate chunk cookie.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joshua Johnson, marketing manager for Insomnia Cookies, wrote in an email to The Herald that the business is “very excited to be open in Providence.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The community and University have been extremely supportive,” he wrote. “We are happy to be able to spread the love of warm delicious cookies in Providence.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Last weekend marked a historic time for the University’s arts community: the launch of the Brown Arts Initiative. Thursday afternoon, faculty members, students and administrators gathered in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts’ modern and spacious studios to celebrate and kick off the weekend-long re|ACT<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>symposium on arts and the environment. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are rolling out the BAI at a moment of uncertainty for the arts and the … humanities community,” said President Christina Paxson P’19 in a speech at the opening event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We have looming threats to the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities (and) some real concerns about freedom of expression, which is core to what artists do in their lives. In this kind of time, active and principled support for the arts is more essential than ever.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The BAI brings together eight different creative departments and institutions at Brown in order to promote art in an interdisciplinary environment. “The experimental, collaborative and engaged art practice and scholarship …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is emblematic of Brown and a hallmark of” the BAI, said Faculty Director of the BAI Joseph Butch Rovan, who also co-directs the Multimedia Electronic Music Experiments program and previously chaired the music department. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Twenty-two international artists, writers, curators, architects, musicians and designers participated in the symposium. With their various backgrounds and fields, the speakers provided an interdisciplinary take on the environment. With their work, they exemplified how creative thought and artistic processes relate to the environment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The symposium … was designed to communicate the breadth and interdisciplinary focus of the BAI,” wrote Anne Bergeron, managing director of the BAI, in an email to The Herald. Because the notion of “arts and environment” is germane to all art forms and the notion of “environment” can also be interpreted broadly, a range of future programming opportunities can be created, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Keynote speaker Natalie Jeremijenko, an Australian artist, engineer and professor at New York University,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>spoke on Friday about mutualism — a biological concept that suggests that two organisms or species can coexist in a mutually beneficial state. Pollination is an example of mutualism, in which bees and flowers both benefit from the existence of the other. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jeremijenko questioned the current reductionist attitude in the context of environmental preservation. Rather than seeking to continually reduce one’s carbon footprint, Jeremijenko argued for rethinking humankind’s relationship with the environment altogether. Her work innovates new designs and relationships that are mutually beneficial to humans and the flora and fauna of a specific location. “We can do more than less. We can do something,” she said. “We can benefit from each other’s presence.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The symposium’s panels also touched on other subjects that syngerized art and the environmental cause. Architects and artists used water in their designs in environmentally responsible ways. Musicians and composers intimately interacted with the natural world to create soundscapes. Photographers and writers explored the plastic pollution of the world’s oceans.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The plastic pollution panel featured artists such as Marcus Eriksen, a pivotal player in the legislative battle to ban microbeads in the United States. Microbeads are small bits of plastic found in hygiene products such as toothpaste or body scrubs that pollute water and are detrimental to sea life.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Another panelist was Pam Longobardi, who makes art out of the plastic she collects while cleaning polluted beaches. Plastic will be the one lasting impression humans will leave behind — a marker of the anthropocene, the geological age in which human activity has dominated the environment, Longobardi said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The symposium is accompanied by exhibitions such as Chris Jordan’s “Message from the Gyre,” which pictures dead albatross on Midway Island. The birds died with bellies stuffed with plastic they had mistaken for food. The portraits of the plastic’s victims call for a “radical global change of consciousness,” Jordan said. The exhibition will be on display at Granoff’s Cohen Gallery until March 24.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Throughout the weekend, artists pushed for awareness of environmental degradation at the hands of current human lifestyles. Words by Carl Safina, a nature writer who spoke at the plastic pollution panel, echoed this sentiment: “Why do you make art out of plastic garbage? To make people look — because that’s the role of the artist.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Hamilton” — the musical that shook the world of Broadway — has become so ubiquitous that nowadays, people often think of the play before the political figure. Thanks to this stratospheric success, Lin-Manuel Miranda has achieved international fame and a renewed interest in some of his earlier works. Chief among those is “In the Heights,” a play centered in New York City’s Washington Heights neighborhood, which debuted in 1999.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Miranda conceived of the music and lyrics for the play while Quiara Alegría Hudes ’04 MFA wrote the book for the play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This month, the “Heights” hype reached Brown’s Stuart Theater with a student performance. The musical focuses on an eclectic group of friends and families who live on the same block. The play’s main character and de facto narrator is bodega-owner Usnavi. Originally from the Dominican Republic, Usnavi’s father named him after a passing ship he witnessed while immigrating to America — “U.S. Navy.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Usnavi is played by Richard Flores ’16.5, whose impressive rap style sounds uncannily similar to that of Miranda’s style, who originally played the part. In the play, Usnavi strives to make an earnest living in an area riddled with crime and poverty, contending with his impish and flighty cousin, Sonny, and vying for the affections of young hairdresser Vanessa. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In the Heights” focuses on the complexity of the everyday lives of its characters, featuring hashed-out drama, salsa interludes and saccharine monologues. Viva Sandoval ’20 plays Nina, a college freshman returned home for the summer. Throughout the play, Nina deals with her overprotective parents’ disapproval of her choice to take a leave of absence from Stanford, as well as her relationship with Benny, her father’s employee and the only non-Hispanic character. Meanwhile, Nina’s best friend from childhood, Vanessa — played by Elise Harmon ’17 — longs to move away from Washington Heights like her studious companion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the play begins slowly, it picks up during the culmination of the first half of the musical — when a blackout interrupts the characters. “We are powerless,” they croon poignantly, if a little too on the nose. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stand-outs from this weekend’s performance include powerhouse vocalists Sandoval and Harmon, showcasing singing chops that belong on a Broadway stage. Moreover, Sandoval is the perfect Nina, capturing the character’s complex amalgamation of naivety, cleverness and innocence. Also noteworthy is the impressive acting talent of Paola Jimenez ’20, whose accent, stage presence and vocals steal the show. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the Broadway stage, “In the Heights” was met with mixed reviews. Many critics lauded the scoring and performances, but some felt that a musical with tickets that sometimes cost over $1,000 was not the best way to comment on social issues like gentrification. With “Hamilton,” too, Miranda faced similar criticisms — while bringing diversity, inclusivity and representation to the theater is an undisputedly crucial feat, it can alienate exactly the people who these creations are supposed to include. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That being said, now more than ever, it is direly important to perform these works again and again. In these tumultuous times, the charge to push back against homogeneity is being led by the art world with great success.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In the Heights” will continue its run at Brown this upcoming weekend.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Students talk music industry issues, solutions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“How do we create a music industry with more winners than losers?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In an attempt to answer this question, Benevolent Records, a student-run record label at Brown, and Music2020, a growing organization advocating for positive change in the music industry, teamed up to host a three-part event fittingly entitled “A Music Industry With More Winners Than Losers.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The series began several weeks ago with its first installment, featuring an information session on current issues in the music industry. This was followed by the second installment: an opportunity for interested students to pitch potential solutions to such issues. Five elevator pitches were selected, and students were invited to present their ideas at the culminating event, which took place Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After introductions by Founder and President of Benevolent Records Lindsay Sack ’19 as well as the co-founders of Music2020, Scott Kirby and Visiting Professor of Music George Howard, students presented solutions to ongoing challenges facing the artistic community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Presentations were followed by a roundtable discussion. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Students examined a variety of different issues — some focused on organizational obstacles faced by independent musicians not affiliated with a label or manager, while others explored the imbalance of power between record labels and artists. Julia Elia ’17, who has worked with multiple artists and record labels, delved into the effects of the pressures of touring and live concert performances on artists’ mental health.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s just something I’ve been really aware of, working with artists for as long as I have … I’m constantly surprised (that it) doesn’t get more attention and more discussion,” Elia said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s a really hard issue to try to tackle and try to ultimately solve, and I think the first step is just talking about it (and) bringing it to people’s awareness.”</p>
<p class="p4">Sack’s inspiration for the event occurred last semester when she found herself in Howard’s course, MUSC 1270: “Making it in the Music Business: The New Artist Model.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Benevolent Records came up during one class conversation, prompting the idea of a collaboration between the record label and Music2020. Howard referred Sack to Music2020 staff member Jennifer Howe as a contact, and planning progressed from there. Sack described the event’s purpose as twofold: “On the one hand, we really wanted to provoke discussion. Then the other aspect of it was to … encourage action.”</p>
<p class="p4">Though it was founded in 2016, Music2020 is “really a continuation of (Scott Kirby and my) ongoing work,” Howard said. “This is something that both of us together, and before we even knew each other, were working on … We both have devoted our lives to the idea that we want a system where musicians and artists have more direct power and control over their careers.”</p>
<p class="p4">One of Music2020’s core missions is to r<span class="s3">educe constraints surrounding the production and distribution of music. In an ideal world, “music, information, rights and money (would be) transferred between artists and fans in the most efficient, productive and profitable way,” Kirby said. Both founders of Music2020 agreed that major record labels, performance rights organizations and streaming services dominate the music industry, leaving little room for artists to make their own voices heard. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Saturday’s event was one of several Music2020 has conducted since its establishment. Howard hoped that simply attending the event, listening to the presentations and participating in the discussions would inspire students to stir up change, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">“For a lot of reasons, going and speaking to college students is the right approach,” Howard said. “(College students) tend to care about music; they tend to be eager to get involved. I think if you look historically, much activism began at the college level.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p4">Change in the music industry can be made in a variety of ways, such as using technology, increasing support for individual artists <span class="s3">and changing laws surrounding musicians’ rights and the relationship between artists and record labels, according to Saturday’s presenters. Everyday consumers can also help change the industry. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Being an educated consumer and a knowledgeable consumer and trying, in whatever ways you can, to do what’s best for the artist … I think that’s really where to start,” Sack said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="s3">Mateus Picanco Lima Gomes ’18 grew up playing music in Brazil. When he was 11, he learned to strum the four-stringed cavaquinho. But as time went on, his interest in traditional Brazilian music waned, and he and his friends became more drawn to the rhythm of rock music. During his first weeks at Brown, he encountered a familiar sound. He heard a pandeiro, a Brazilian tambourine, at the activities fair and followed the sound to a booth. The musician playing the instrument was Maris Jones ’15, who founded Bloco da Brown, an Afro-Brazilian percussion group based on a similar club she had been a part of in high school. Picanco Lima Gomes joined Bloco da Brown and the organization has been integral to his college experience ever since. The club has been his way of “coming back to Brazilian </span>music,” he said.
<p class="p4">Carlo Ladd ’17 had a similar intro<span class="s3">duction to Bloco da Brown. A lifetime musician with an interest in percussion, Ladd decided to join with Picanco Lima Gomes and Jessica Kenny ’17. Today, Ladd leads the percussion group, taking care to ensure it remains a collaborative operation. “You can learn,” Ladd said. “Everyone has a rhythm in them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gabriela de Queiroz Campos ’19 became involved “kind of by accident,” she said. After receiving an email from fellow Brazilian students about Bloco da Brown, she showed up assuming she would attend some kind of performance. “I was handed drums,” she said. “I kept coming because I liked it.” De Queiroz Campos sees the group as “a great way to stay involved with things that are culturally important to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The group has played all around New England and has been featured at gatherings ranging from events hosted by the University’s Department of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies to performances at Harvard for Carnival. Bloco da Brown has even played at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, where they hosted Brazilian soccer player Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, affectionately referred to as “Kaká.” Bloco da Brown has gone from jamming at local events to the main stage without compromising their open attitude, according to Ladd. “I don’t know if there’s another group quite like us at Brown,” he said, adding that Bloco is “a culturally-grounded group that still plays concerts for large amounts of people.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The group plays three core rhythms: samba, maracatu and samba reggae, Kenny said. They also play more popular music, including funk, which is often played at clubs or parties in Brazil. Recently, the group has even taken on some American pop songs to play during some of their collaborations and shows. This helped when they played with the acapella groups Brown’sTones, the Bear Bones and the Chattertocks, which served as an opportunity for Bloco da Brown to develop a space for the interface of Brazilian percussion and pop music. Bloco da Brown combines “a new wave of Brazilian music and old traditional music,” Ladd said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ladd arranges the music with help from Picanco Lima Gomes and other members of the group. In keeping with Bloco oral tradition, the group rarely writes anything down. “You do it so many times it gets drilled in your head,” de Queiroz Campos said. “I was going to say you can do it with your eyes closed … (but) of course, it’s drumming,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We speak a lot of Portuguese,” Kenny said. “Our goal is to be open and share.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I always translate the jokes,” Picanco Lima Gomes added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bloco da Brown invites anyone interested, with any level of experience or skill, to join them in making music. “I step in there and I feel at home,” Kenny said</span>.</p>
<p class="p4"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article misspelt "pandeiro," a Brazilian tambourine, as "pondeiro." The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For CNN and its media brethren, attacking President Trump hasn’t paid off … or has it? Painted by Trump as “fake news” outlets deceiving the American populace, the role of media publications as the arbiters of fact and fiction in American society seems to be increasingly imperiled. But their coffers tell a decidedly different story. This reflects a dubious symbiosis between the liberal media and Trump that is particularly uncomfortable for any progressive blissfully retweeting clips of Jake Tapper criticizing the president.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Interestingly, Trump himself isn’t a boon for ratings. Events featuring Trump, like the inauguration or his recent congressional address, have failed to eclipse the viewership numbers that former President Barack Obama routinely received while in office. Rather, as Josef Adalian of Vulture points out: “Even if viewers aren’t flocking to see Trump himself on TV, viewers are very interested in watching shows about Trump.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Indeed, responses to Trump’s outbursts have proven to be an extremely profitable business model for news outlets. MSNBC liberal heavyweight Rachel Maddow’s viewership numbers last month more than doubled February 2016’s numbers. The late-night television landscape mirrors this development: Stephen Colbert’s politically conscious “The Late Show” on CBS rode a wave of Trump-bashing to its current position at the top of the late-night talk show rankings, a position it hadn’t held in nearly two years. Colbert passed his NBC rival Jimmy Fallon, whose rather shameless brand of anti-politicking and humanizing of Trump has rightfully drawn ire from critics.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">CNN has been Trump’s most conspicuous target, the original victim of the president’s now-viral “fake news” label. Jeff Zucker, president of CNN Worldwide, recently spoke at the INTV media conference about the network’s antagonistic relationship with the president. “I think there has never been a more important time to do journalism and that many of the organizations in the United States have never done better work or more important journalism,” Zucker said. “It is really the renaissance of journalism in America because of the nature of what is going on.” But for all of Zucker’s attempts to wax poetic about the state of journalism, he was later forced to admit the network’s obsessive interest with Trump has increased profit margins. Indeed, CNN’s viewership ratings reached an all-time high in the aftermath of the election. For all the talk of journalistic integrity, it’s impossible to ignore that media outlets who chase Trump’s tweets and misdirections down the proverbial rabbit hole routinely resurface with gold in their hands.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sensationalizing Trump’s unfounded claims and profiteering off that hyperbole represents as much of a threat to the future of journalism as the president’s branding the media as “the enemy of the people.” When asked about the media’s tendency to explode after a Trump tweet, former late-night host David Letterman responded “Let’s stop (treating every Trump tweet as breaking news). We don’t need more confirmation that there’s something wrong with Donald Trump. Let’s instead find ways to rebuild what is rational.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Letterman’s warning proves particularly poignant when considering how Trump has benefited from the faux war he has waged with the media. The GDelt Project tracked the number of mentions that major news networks gave to various candidates during the presidential election — Trump’s 1.5 million mentions by outlets like Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and others nearly doubled that of the next twenty candidates combined. As a society, we are well removed from Cronkite-era levels of trust in news anchors and broadcasts as purveyors of truth and logic. But even today, when networks repeat a narrative enough times, it begins to take the shape of fact. Talk about Trump’s candidacy enough times, and he begins to look like a legitimate candidate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moreover, in hunting profit over journalistic integrity, news networks have taught Trump a dangerous lesson. Through the production of sensationalism, he can misdirect attention away from the myriad issues in his administration that require serious investigation. Last week, amid a swelling tide of allegations about the White House’s connections to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Trump unleashed a series of tweets accusing Obama of wiretapping phone lines in Trump Tower in the weeks prior to the election. For nearly a week now, almost every major media outlet has treated Trump’s unsupported claims as an explosive breaking news story.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Reports quickly emerged that Trump had likely based his claim off an illogical conspiracy theory spewed on live radio by conservative firebrand and moral black-hole Mark Levin. Breitbart News, the former domain of Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon, then picked up the story.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Upon that reveal, networks should have turned their attention to more serious news. Trump repeats what he hears from ethically compromised sources — end of story. Instead, CNN and its fellows whipped themselves into a collective frenzy, and applying the classic elements of investigative journalism to the “story” only lent credence to the idea that a Trump tweet could morph itself into a legitimate news narrative. News outlets didn’t cover every time Obama stepped out of the oval office to take a bathroom break. Trump’s tweets are essentially the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of course, simply ignoring Trump’s manic episodes does a disservice to the American people as well. How then, should news networks and late-night hosts approach Trump without compromising their integrity? The answer is perhaps best understood in juxtaposing the work done by two late-night hosts, John Oliver and Samantha Bee, against “Saturday Night Live.” Certainly, while all three participate in Trump-based satire, John Oliver and Samantha Bee play the journalism hawk role in a way that SNL decidedly avoids. But, as Mark Harris of New York Magazine points out, “Samantha Bee and John Oliver always know why they hate someone; sometimes, SNL just knows that it hates someone. That’s not enough.” CNN, as well as its fellow news networks and late-night hosts, have made it clear that they hate Trump and will continue to challenge him. Too often, though, it feels like they love to hate him. After all, that hate has turned quite a pretty penny.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Exhibition calls attention to dehumanizing aspect of solitary confinement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Solitary Confinement,” the Nightingale Brown House Gallery’s latest exhibition on the ills of solitary confinement in the United States, closed to the public with a reception March 11. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The main feature of the exhibition, which opened Jan. 30, was a replica of a solitary cell. A bleak and restricted slab of concrete, the piece was a poignant depiction of the stark reality facing those in the throes of the dehumanizing measure of captivity. The replica was accompanied by similar testaments to the egregious mistreatment of the imprisoned. It featured multimedia representations that included sketches of special housing units, graphic novel-like panels testifying to poor facility conditions, letters from prisoners once victim to solitary confinement and audio recordings of those currently incarcerated in Rhode Island. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s a way of shak(ing) people out of that daily routine way of being and put(ting) them into a headspace where they’re more attentive,” said Assistant Director of the Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage Marisa Brown, who, along with Matthew Branch, Thaddeus Gibson GS and Cherise Morris ’16 GS, was responsible for organizing the installation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The last couple of years we’ve been doing programs related to the issue of installation,” Brown said. She mentioned “Solitary Confinement” as the Center’s latest effort, following a University of Rhode Island gallery and a prison education conference attended by such schools as Cornell, Bard College, Princeton and Brown. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Shawn Hesse, head of the Boston branch of the architectural firm emersion DESIGN, and C. Morgan Grefe MA’00 PhD’05 executive director of the Rhode Island Historical Society, led the exhibition’s closing reception. Hesse addressed the obligation architects have to curbing social injustice, while Grefe spoke at length on the narratives of prisons turned into museums. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hesse also serves on the board of directors of Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibility. Seeking to curtail the design of solitary confinement cells and comparable spaces, the group explores the dynamic role architects occupy in ethical building practices. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“As an industry, we have a responsibility to use our collective voice to speak out against systems that are unjust, including mass incarceration and capital punishment,” Hesse said, speaking on his — and not emersion DESIGN’s — behalf. “It’s a little disappointing and sad when we speak with activists surprised that architects care about human rights. We have to work to elevate the profession so that it’s no longer a surprise to people that we care.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this vein, Hesse helped curate the architectural half of the exhibit. He is also working with others toward an initiative the urges architects to comment on the current border crisis between the United States and Mexico. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s important from an individual perspective to work within the industry, work with immigrants (and) raise the profiles of these issues industry-wide,” Hesse said. “One architect refusing to participate in the industry isn’t going to change anything.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Grefe approached the issue of solitary confinement from a more historical lens. She lectured on the history of solitary confinement and the efforts made by former prisons in documenting its usage. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She addressed the function of now-defunct penitentiaries in educating the public, referencing Philadelphia’s Eastern State Penitentiary as an exceptional example of a prison-turned-museum. Grefe mentioned how a quarter of prisons have already been converted into museums, stressing the necessity of curbing the development of additional “awful and inhumane institutions.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m troubled by the monetization of prisons fueled by an obligation to fill beds,” Grefe said. “It’s disturbing to me that there’s some board out there focused on thinking about ways of maximizing space in prisons.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wong’s Kitchen opens on Waterman</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Attention, Brunonia: The “coming soon” sign at 108 Waterman St. has finally been removed. After over a year of construction, Wong’s Kitchen is now open.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The new pan-Asian restaurant opened its doors on Mar. 1, moving in next to popular bubble-tea shop Kung Fu Tea. Once home to a cigar shop, the location has been completely renovated. Now it houses a simple and well-lit dining space with booths and tables flanked by an open kitchen on one side and a view of Waterman on the other. Customers place their orders at the register, where the extensive menu is listed in a colorful font. Restaurant owner and manager Tom Wong usually staffs the register, greeting customers with a cheerful smile.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wong — who owns and operates another restaurant, Wong Dynasty, in Holden, Mass. — described Wong’s Kitchen as a “homier” branch of his eatery chain. He decided to establish Wong’s Kitchen on Waterman after noting the large student community on College Hill and the lack of Asian eateries around Brown’s campus. “We always loved this area,” Wong said. “And at the time, I didn’t see that many Chinese restaurants here, like the one we have … Even right now, I don’t see any restaurants like that, like a one-stop shop. We’ve got everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Kitchen is indeed a “one-stop shop,” serving fare from Vietnam, Japan and China, including pho, wonton soup, teriyaki, hibachi and traditional staples like General Tso’s chicken and fried spring rolls. Customers can also mix and match one, two or three sides and pair them with fried rice or noodles to create a “special.” “It’s like a combination, a fusion” of cuisines, Wong said, adding that the restaurant menu might expand in the future to include other types of food, like sushi.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While many of its options are pricier than meals at University dining halls, the restaurant boasts exceptional service and a pleasant atmosphere. Menu items, however, vary in quality: The crab rangoons deliver a delightful crunch and ooze with a warm, tangy cheese. But the stir-fried beef tastes rather bland and watery. The beef pho, perfectly rich and flavorful, comes in a whopping serving size,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but the fried rice — while not unappetizing — is only average. Ultimately, as long as customers choose their orders wisely, they are likely to be satisfied with their meal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providence’s selection of Asian eateries has been historically sparse. Wong’s Kitchen joins the ranks of new restaurants that have recently been capitalizing on this unfilled niche. Between the recent openings of Den Den Café Asiana, Kung Fu Tea, Tom’s Bao Bao — all of which took place over the course of the past three years — and the soon-to-be opened Korean Fried Chicken on Angell Street, Providence seems to be moving toward a greater variety of Asian cuisine — a welcome addition for many Brown students. “We have a lot of Asian people here (in Providence), … and I’m sure they want some Asian tastes,” Wong said. “They don’t want to eat burritos, or sandwiches … or pizza every day.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The restaurant has been popular with the Brown community, Wong said. “Because we have … all different kinds of food, we can cover a lot of bases for the students around here,” he added. “And it’s fast for students, too; when they have tasks, they can come in, (and after) two minutes, three minutes, they can leave.” Despite the restaurant’s recent opening, Wong has been acquainted with multiple returning customers and says he knows “a lot of people already.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the early months of spring, Brown students enjoy multiple film festivals of consequence<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— from the French Film Festival to the much-anticipated Ivy Film Festival. The Department of Italian Studies features its own selection of films annually through its Il Cinema Ritrovato festival. But what distinguishes the films of Il Cinema Ritrovato is the distinctly historical perspective of the festival, which is committed to screening films dating all the way back to the early 20th century. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Italian film festival serves as the American version of an eight-day summer event in Bologna, which is committed to restoring old films and promoting early cinema. Il Cinema Ritrovato’s mission is “to show wonderful films, restored films, forgotten films,” said Guy Borlée, the coordinator of the festival. “We want to give these wonderful films a sort of second life.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Restoration is so important because an old film is on film stock, and there are no more theaters with print projectors, except for cinematheques,” Borlée said. As such, these movies on film are forgotten and eventually fall into disrepair. “As time goes by, the oldest material deteriorates, so if you have a very old film, the original film might be damaged or lost. So you have to repair it,” Borlée added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Department of Italian Studies hosted four days of screening and “wanted to give a space to different genres,” said Massimo Riva, professor of Italian studies. These films ranged from a 1915 silent film titled “A day with Puccini” to an Italian-American 1980s film titled “Once Upon a Time in America.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Each year, the mini-festival at Brown features a silent movie night with live music. This year, Thursday night’s showing was a compilation of silent films from the early twentieth century that shed light on life in Venice and Bologna. The films were accompanied by live piano and mandolin. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The festival also makes sure to include “a classic film from the 1960s — the golden age of Italian cinema,” Riva said. This year’s selection was “I knew her well,” directed by Antonio Pietrangeli.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the festival primarily focuses on old Italian cinema, international films are frequently featured.This year’s festival featured a Cuban film titled “Memories of Underdevelopment,” since Bologna’s festival restores films from around the world. “There is a historical dimension with (“Memories of Underdevelopment”) — shot four or five years after the revolution; it’s about change. You get to see Havana as it was at the time through the eyes of the main character,” Riva said. “In this way, film is always time-travelling,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The idea to import a sampling of Bologna’s famous film festival came from the long-standing relationship between Brown and the University of Bologna, Riva said. The Department of Italian Studies sponsors a summer program where students can partake in the actual eight-day long Italian festival. Students in Bologna also have the opportunity to study filmmaking and Italian cinematic culture. “It was only natural … to bring back a piece of the festival to Providence,” Riva said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the Brown leg of the festival has only existed for four years, it has garnered an attendance of “approximately 530 people” throughout the four nights, wrote Valeria Federeci GS in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown’s Il Cinema Ritrovato is also accompanied by award-winning gelato — described by the The London Observer as the “Best in Europe” — shipped directly from Bologna’s famous Il Gelatauro. Each year, the gelato-maker creates four specific flavors inspired by the festival’s films. For example, for “Memories of Underdevelopment,” the corresponding gelato featured flavors of chocolate, rum and plantains.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s2">Taking an incredibly novel approach to fighting climate change, the Poler Bears, Brown’s pole dancing troupe, hosted “Poler Bears for Polar Bears,” a fundraiser for the Environmental Justice League of Rhode Island March 10 in Alumnae Hall. In addition to pole dancing, the night also featured performances that ranged from hip-hop to traditional Okinawan dance. All the money collected will be donated directly to EJLRI. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“We had been toying for a while with the idea of having an event called ‘Poler Bears for the Polar Bears,’” said Sonya Gurwitt ’17, a member of the troupe. Poler Bears originally wanted to fundraise for organizations involved in wildlife protection, she said. Citing political events and potential environmental policy changes in Washington, Poler Bears “decided we didn’t want to have a benefit show for polar bears because there are so many people in Rhode Island that need it a lot more,” Gurwitt said. The group chose to support a local organization that could directly help marginalized members of the Providence community, Gurwitt added.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Nia Galloway ’18, another member of the Poler Bears, described the EJLRI as an organization that does “a lot of community building projects and (focuses) on empowering individuals who are normally left out these discussions about environmentalism.” Gurwitt also noted the organization has worked with Brown students in the past, making the collaboration easier to arrange. It was “important that (the Poler Bears) did an event to connect students with the Providence community and issues that directly affect them,” Gallway added. The Poler Bears hoped the fundraiser would be successful in helping marginalized communities who would be more adversely affected by climate change. Sophie Sandweiss ’19, a member of the Poler Bears, said she liked the “broad outreach” the organization has in the Rhode Island community.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Various student groups performed at the event, including Attitude Dance Co., Gendo Taiko, Mezcla Latinx Dance Troupe, Brown Aerial Arts Society, GBX Dance Crew, Amira Belly Dance Co. and Fusion Dance Company. Jimena Terrazas ’19, co-director of Mezcla troupe, said the group “admires the Poler Bears as dancers and was very excited to collaborate with them.” She added that, though fighting climate change was not the initial reason Mezcla signed on to the event, members later became passionate about the cause.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“(Environmental justice) is not really our area, but we advocate for minorities, and they will be affected more by climate change,” she said. Mezcla’s contingent performed an upbeat and provocative routine to Beyoncé’s “Dance for You,” drawing cheers from the excited crowd.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Fusion Dance Company also performed a short routine that featured 14 dancers and was set to “Show Me” by Alina Baraz. The group also has “always been political and connected to social issues,” said Nora Ellmann ’17, Fusion’s co-manager. Ellmann said the group “hasn’t worked specifically on environmental justice before but find(s) it very important.” She described their performance as “fun” and “sensual.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Gendo Taiko performed a traditional Okinawan dance choreographed by Frances Nakachi. It featured two background musicians and four dancers, led by Stephanie Adaniya ’20. Marley Kirton ’17, director of Gendo Taiko, said the group usually performs traditional music pieces, but chose to perform a dance to stay in line with the event’s theme.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The fundraiser also featured nine separate performances by the Poler Bears, who acrobatically climbed, twirled and flipped around the two poles placed onstage. Though the crowd was continuously engaged and cheering, Betty Peng’s ’17 performance, “F— and Leave,” set to “Company” by Tinashe, received a notable standing ovation. Gurwitt also evoked cheers from the crowd, performing a unique routine in a circular hoop suspended from the ceiling, using it as a platform for acrobatic swings and flips.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The performance filled Alumnae Hall to capacity, forcing an overflow crowd to stand in the back. “Our goal for Brown was to put on this show and have everybody here enjoy the various talented dancers,” Sandweiss said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Magnetic Fields releases new 50-song album detailing musician’s life</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Boston-based alternative act The Magnetic Fields, known for its quirky, self-effacing and conversational lyrics, released “Selections from 50 Song Memoir” to Spotify March 10. The album stays true to the band’s synthetic pop-influenced sound with an emphasis on lead singer Stephin Merritt’s storytelling.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The “50 Song Memoir” project debuted last year on Spotify with a preview EP featuring only five selections from the full set of songs. Last week, Merritt unveiled 16 new songs on the music-streaming platform, though all 50 songs are currently available on iTunes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The album traces Merrit’s life from his birth until present day. The honest lyrics formulate excerpts of an autobiography, organized by years, according to NPR . The “Selections” version released on Spotify includes a sampling of experiences ranging from 1968 to 2013. The pieces are distinct but remain consistent with the insecure, romantic character developed in many of The Magnetic Fields’ past songs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Much like The Magnetic Fields’ earlier “69 Love Songs,” the album’s eccentric organization reflects the band’s character as dutifully as the songs themselves. The events and culture of each year inform the lyrics of the chronological anthology. In “’69 Judy Garland,” Merritt describes in his straight-forward, nonchalant style: “We tried to drive to Woodstock but/ Our little blue bug couldn’t cut/ Through that last hundred miles of traffic.” In “’70 They’re Killing Children Over There” he recalls the wartime political commentary of Grace Slick and band Jefferson Airplane, also undercutting contemporary culture, adding “Now that everyone is fat and complacent/ I haven’t heard a protest in years.” In “’84: Danceteria!” Merritt describes “Seeing the Shirelles or ESG,” at a popular New York City night club, juxtaposing a boppy girl group from his early childhood and a more popular ‘80s post-punk group. The references to pop culture rely, to an extent, on cliches such as the title of “’79 Rock’n’Roll Will Ruin Your Life.” But these shameless affirmations of pop culture enable Merritt to effectively capture the changing decades through the lens of his own experience.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">What makes the album especially appealing is Merritt’s self-characterization. He recalls in “’73 It Could Have Been Paradise” that, in his youth, “Huckleberry Finn was (his) only friend.” In “’86 How I Failed Ethics,” Merritt remembers his own college experience as an angsty, intellectual outsider, singing that he “spent the whole course positing (his) own ethical system/ While other college students emptied kegs.” In “’02 Be True to Your Bar” the listener encounters a middle-aged, isolated Merritt in a musical rut “drinking Irish breakfast all day long.” These eccentric details resonate with the nonconformist demographic that subscribes to The Magnetic Fields. Through his honest and offbeat autobiography, Merritt offers his listeners an opportunity to relate not only to his lyrics but to the cliche of a character he ultimately develops.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The consistently playful synthetic music serves almost as a background for the self-portrait Merritt paints with anecdotal excerpts of life as a musician. “50 Song Memoir” gives the album a unique role — Merritt makes a multi-part memoir of a record that suits his straightforward sound and offbeat poeticisms. The result is two hours, 30 minutes and 15 seconds of nontraditional and informal self-exploration, accessible through “Selections,” or in the full articulation of 50 years.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Featuring a “virtual reality arcade,” a discussion panel on the role of female film score composers and several distinguished keynote speakers, the lineup for the 2017 Ivy Film Festival is slated to cover a breadth of topics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p2">In total, the festival includes two discussion panels, two advanced screenings of upcoming feature films and three keynote speakers: M. Night Shyamalan, Barry Levinson and Ezra Edelman. The keystone of the week, however, is the screening of the “Official Selection,” 25 films submitted by undergraduate and graduate student filmmakers across the globe and curated by a branch of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>IFF, the student group that organizes the festival. This year’s selection, chosen from an array of over 300 entries from 40 different countries, will be screened in three blocks on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p class="p2">“We think working with student filmmakers …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>captures a different approach to filmmaking (than working with industry professionals),” said Solveig Xia ’17, co-executive director of IFF. “As students, we want to promote other students’ work.” In choosing its official selection, IFF aims to feature films from a diverse set of genres and regions, seeking out “relevant and topical films,” said Co-Managing Director Madeline Chin ’17. One of the festival’s goals is to “celebrate diversity and … bring in people with different perspectives,” Xia added.</p>
<p class="p2">A notable addition to this year’s festival is IFF X VR, a new initiative linking the festival with the emerging medium of virtual reality. As part of this initiative, the festival will feature a “virtual reality arcade,” in which participants can use a variety of equipment to view films in virtual reality, created by both student and professional artists. “There’s so much exciting potential for virtual reality (to be used) in the arts and the sciences,” Chin said. With the inclusion of this novel technological aspect of the festival, IFF hopes to “reach a wider audience on campus,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">As a separate event, IFF X VR will also be screening Planned Parenthood’s “Across the Line,” an immersive virtual reality experience following a woman’s travel to a Planned Parenthood clinic for an abortion. The festival brought the experience to campus to highlight “a really important issue, but also to really show how (virtual reality) can be used as a medium to understand the experiences of others,” Xia said. “It creates a lens to promote empathy and mutual understanding.”</p>
<p class="p2">Apart from the addition of virtual reality, IFF has expanded significantly since its founding in other ways. For example, the IFF Satellite Festival was established two years ago, extending the festival’s screenings to 16 other universities — two of which are international. “The core of our mission is to give a platform to student filmmakers,” Chin said. “Expanding that beyond Brown University was a really big goal of ours.”</p>
<p class="p2">The IFF team, headed by Xia, Chin, Co-Managing Director Sienna Giraldi ’18.5 and Co-Executive Director Oakley Friedberg ’17, has been working since last summer to put together this year’s film festival. “You start out with a small idea,” said Xia. “And seeing it grow, and seeing things actually happening — every little step of the way feels like a celebration.”</p>
<p class="p2">IFF is Brown’s annual student-run film festival, taking place this year from April 10 to April 16. Founded in 2001 by Justin Slosky ’03 and David Peck ’03, the week-long festival serves as platform to highlight and celebrate student film. Events will take place primarily in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts, with a few individual events in Salomon Hall and the Avon Theatre. All the festival’s events are free and open to the public, though a few will require tickets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brown club figure skating delivers magical performance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">From 7 to 8 p.m. Monday evening, Meehan Auditorium echoed with familiar tunes that evoked childhood memories of talking candlesticks, flying magic carpets and underwater kingdoms. Along to the sweeping melody of “A Whole New World” and the upbeat rhythms of “Under the Sea,” 20 members of Brown Club Figure Skating spun and glided across the frozen surface of the auditorium’s ice skating rink while spectators enjoyed complimentary cups of hot chocolate.</p>
<p class="p4">The figure skating team’s annual spring performance was themed for the first time. Inspired by — and named after — Disney’s popular series of touring ice shows, “Disney on Ice,” the Brown Club Figure Skating performance featured songs exclusively from Disney films old and new such as “Lady and the Tramp” and “Moana.” The show involved skaters of all levels, performing both in groups and solo. There were also periodic “demos,” in which individual skaters demonstrated common skating moves, such as two-foot turns and bunny hops for the benefit of audience members.</p>
<p class="p4">“(Putting together the show) has been a great bonding experience,” said Elizabeth Pan ’18, co-president of Brown Club Figure Skating. “It’s really cool to see the creativity of all the skaters and all the hard work (they put in), too — because participating in the show takes a long time.” Involvement in the show was voluntary for members of the skating team. Those who chose to participate had the opportunity to choreograph and perform their own pieces, Pan said. For the past month, performers were hard at work perfecting their routines, practicing both on and off the ice. Planning the show itself was an even longer process and began last semester partly due to time constraints imposed by the annual closing of the Meehan ice rink after spring break, Pan added.</p>
<p class="p4">To kick-start the event, 20 performers filed onto the rink for a group number: “Circle of Life” from “The Lion King.” Due to the size of the performing body, Pan and Jacob Jaffe ’17, co-president of the team,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>worked together to choreograph the piece. In choreographing ice show performances, they took into account both the music and visual effects. “Listen to the music,” Jaffe said, also referencing several movements he and Pan chose to incorporate that “produced a cool visual result.”</p>
<p class="p4">Brown Club Figure Skating has been around for about seven years, eventually growing from a student activity to an official club sport in 2014. Apart from staging their semiannual shows, the club also competes in regional intercollegiate skating competitions and practices regularly in the mornings at Meehan. The semester performances themselves were established around four years ago but since then have grown to be much more “cohesive,” Jaffe said. “This year has been more intensive. Our choreography has definitely gotten more structured,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">As part of this expansion, Brown Club Figure Skating took initiative on a long-time goal to become more involved with other student groups on campus, choosing to team up with Disney A Cappella, a student-run a cappella group specializing in Disney songs, to put on “Disney on Ice.”</p>
<p class="p4">The group took to the stage partway through the performance, singing selections from a variety of movie soundtracks, including “I Won’t Say I’m in Love,” “Colors of the Wind” and — fittingly — an entire musical medley from “Frozen.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dinner forges connections between strangers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cast in an alluring haze, the dining room’s atmosphere offers an enigmatic embrace. Camel cigarette embers reveal obscured faces. Distinctive aromas of exotic liquors and oysters permeate the air. Intoxicating chatter navigates everything from Middle Eastern history to the artistry of contemporary hip-hop. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Welcome to the Bearhead Dinner — a veritable institution on Williams Street. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hosted by three students, the Bearhead Dinner is a far cry from a typical meal shared with house mates and friends. The brainchild of Berke Buyukkucak ’18, Caleb Thomas ’18 and Berkok Yuksel ’18, it is rather an atypical yet enjoyable experience that hinges on the unknown. The concept is simple: The trio invites eight people whom they are only vaguely familiar with for a night of experimental recipes and new friends — no cost required. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s all about getting diverse people from different circles together,” Thomas said. In this respect, the three house mates are successful. Last Saturday’s dinner — the fifth and most recent Bearhead Dinner — included a professor, a post-doc and undergraduates from a range of concentrations and years. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The idea for the social experiment occurred to the trio during a Spring Break trip to New Orleans. “We started talking about having dinners once we got a house, but wanted to make it a bit more different than inviting friends over,” Yuksel added. “That’s cool but doesn’t add anything to my or your life.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We don’t normally invite people we’re close with,” Yuksel said. “They’re all sort of acquaintances, with a degree of separation that’s inherent,” he added. “The guests don’t know each other, and they’re all from different backgrounds.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The event’s cosmopolitan cuisine further complements the diversity of guests’ backgrounds. Buyukkucak, Thomas and Yuksel cook a variety of unconventional recipes from a multitude of cultures. Served one-by-one, the delectable and consecutive courses present guests with an experience at once unfamiliar and unforgettable. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We aspire to original pieces,” Thomas said. “We could make a simple burger with aioli or something, but … (we love) having weird recipes that go well.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The chefs’ commitment to creativity manifests itself in homemade dishes that run the gamut from a serving of smoked rabbit to a dish that consists wholly of onion prepared six different ways. Other singular offerings have included Turkish pickled beets and fresh mint served over cacti, courses that speak to the chefs’ rich and assorted backgrounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We always try to incorporate Turkish or Southwestern dishes into the dinners,” Buyukkucak said, alluding to his and Yuksel’s Turkish heritage, as well as Thomas’ Arizonian roots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the ever-variable dinner parties, emphasis is placed on the idea of eating as a shared experience. Buyukkucak, Thomas and Yuksel create dishes that explicitly foster communal exchange. With trays of oysters and cheeses soaked in coffees, the chefs force otherwise disparate guests to interact with one another in order to receive and enjoy the eccentric food.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Though making the food is half the appeal, the real fun comes in seeing people connect that don’t really know each other,” Yuksel said. “We had two guests meet at the dinner and then start dating.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the dinner is certainly a display to witness, the chefs also attested to what an ordeal it is to prepare the dinners, as recipes must often be formulated well in advance. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The deliberation process has definitely gotten faster,” Thomas said. “But the day of the dinner, we’re still basically cooking from 9 a.m. to the time dessert is served.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s very pushing to the edge both physically and mentally,” Buyukkucak said. “If we fail, we try to compensate somehow. It ends up being a lot about expression, for me at least.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thomas, a drummer, underscored the “improvisational” aspect of the cooking — a quality analogous to his music. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m drawn to the spontaneous aspect of music, and we reflect that in the kitchen,” Thomas said. “If something messes up, we just reflect on what the next move is,” he added, retelling a humorous incident in which the crew had to salvage chimichangas.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A bear head overlooks the dining room table that plays hosts to the Bearhead Dinners. Enigmatic and vaguely enchanting, the head encapsulates the event’s distinctive variability and mystique. But the distinguished piece, painted by the trio’s good friend, Yasemin Orhan RISD ’18, also speaks to a more important facet of the dinner: namely, its paradoxical capacity to breed familiarity out of unfamiliarity. The meal’s guests may be curated from a breadth of backgrounds, but remarkable solidarity can still be found amongst the collective experience of novel recipes. At the Bearhead Dinner, expectations are left at the door, traded for new friends found along the way.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>’80s synth-pop classic Depeche Mode releases new album</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/22/80s-synth-pop-classic-depeche-mode-releases-new-album/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depeche Mode has never shied away from dealing with tough topics. While the band might be primarily known for its dance hit “Just Can’t Get Enough,” Depeche Mode has managed to keep up a pop beat without abandoning the intense philosophical and political undertones present in their lyrics. Since the early ’80s, the band has consistently produced music without failing their fan base. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This legacy continues in their most recent album “Spirit,” which came out Friday. “Spirit,” wrought with emotional intensity, appeals to the same demographic to which Depeche Mode has always catered: the angst-ridden adolescents of the ’80s and, now, their angst-ridden adolescent kids.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Depeche Mode stems from the same era as dance-pop popularized by artists like Madonna and Wham! — and let’s face it, the band had its witty, radio-ready moments, such as “Never Let Me Down Again.” But perhaps because their particular moment in the world of John Hughes-style coming-of-age has passed, the band has turned from playing emphatically ’80s new wave synth-pop tunes to using its music to make straightforward calls to action. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The band’s earlier work — exemplified by its indignant 1990 album “Violator” ­— undoubtedly spoke to the darker aspects of interpersonal relationships. But these songs did not have the political implications prevalent in Depeche Mode’s latest release. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Somewhat ironically, the album starts with “Going Backwards,” which includes the lyrics, “Ignoring the realities / Going Backwards / Are you counting all the casualties?” Evoking protest music popular in the ’60s and ’70s, these lyrics address today’s political climate. But paired with Depeche Mode’s characteristically cluttered synthetic background, the band conveys this political angst with renewed intensity. The consistent, driving electronic beat in “Where’s the Revolution,” which was pre-released as a single in early February, enforces the overt lyrics, “Who’s making your decisions? / You or your religion / You patriotic junkies.” The lyrics of the chorus, “Where’s the revolution / Come on, people / You’re letting me down” address the listener directly and beg for a political movement. The references to “The train is coming / so get on board” are reminiscent of Cat Stevens’ “Peace Train,” an anti-war anthem. Later in “Poorman,” lead singer of Depeche Mode Dave Gahan sings, “Poor man still got the blues / He’s walking around in worn out shoes / With nothing to lose” to elicit the same imagery of Janis Joplin or Bob Dylan while creating a distinct framework to approach recent events with synthetic musical strength.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the album continues, the political messages become less focused, but the lyrics address personal issues with the same potent intensity. The song “You Move” approaches a lighter theme, offering lyrics like “Let me be your man” and “I like the way you move,” but doesn’t sacrifice the album’s consistent tone of melancholy and resentment — “We don’t have that life no more.” The song “Poison Heart” also addresses a romantic relationship but with an outright accusatory tone that feels almost political through the repetition of, “You know we have to break up / You’ll always be alone.” In the context of the larger album, this seems to indicate that in today’s political landscape, it comes as no surprise that the singer’s partner has “poison in (their) heart.” The song “So Much Love” recalls the band’s 1990 hit “Personal Jesus” with its persistent, repetitive, “You can forsake me,” again juxtaposing romance and religious imagery to create a poignant lyrical framework for approaching relationships.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the success of “Spirit,” Depeche Mode has avoided falling into the trap of former pop musicians attempting a comeback. It has consistently continued to produce music since its 1980 debut. More importantly, the band has adjusted its sound without sacrificing its distinct place in the genre of electronic rock. On top of that, the band vehemently addresses contemporary issues. For better or worse, the ephemeral rock movement linking disco and grunge — defined by bands like New Order, the Pet Shop Boys and the Cure — has permanently infiltrated the music landscape.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Spring Weekend to feature Erykah Badu, AlunaGeorge, Young Thug</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Following snow day-related delays and mistakenly disclosed spoilers by artist Young Thug, rumors were finally put to rest Tuesday night as the Brown Concert Agency announced the 2017 Spring Weekend lineup at its annual Whiskey Republic release party. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The pub was electric with anticipation in the final hours, minutes and seconds preceding the midnight announcement. Slated for April 28 and 29, the zenith of on-campus live music and performance culture will blend a gamut of musical genres and highlight a variety of gifted artists.</span> <span class="s3">Friday night will showcase performances by Young Thug, Princess Nokia and Empress Of, while set lists from Erykah Badu, AlunaGeorge and Cherry Glazerr will follow on Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">As previous BCA co-chair Emily Maenner ’16 told The Herald last year, the organization strives to include “as many women as possible in our lineup.” This year BCA prefaced their annual release video with the statement that “in 2016 and 2017 under 30 percent of artists at major festivals were women or people of color.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Like Waka Flocka Flame, who performed at Spring Weekend in 2015, the reveal of Young Thug’s appearance sparked early excitement. The artist is characterized by his sui generis, mumbling vocals that quiver on mixtapes and his LP “Jeffery,” recognized by Rolling Stone Magazine as the 10th best album of 2016. Recent hits like “Wyclef Jean” and “pick up the phone” with Travis Scott featuring Quavo represent just two snippets of the massive archives the hip-hop and trap-influenced artist has released during his career.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Princess Nokia’s echoing, vocal-centric tracks boast an intoxicating bass that reverberates against R&amp;B-inspired accompaniment. In her latest album, “1992,” which showcases “Tomboy” and “Brujas,” the Nuyorican artist draws on her Spanish Harlem and Lower East side roots, gravitating toward empowering content that reflects intellectual liberation, boundless perseverance, female authority and black feminism.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Synth-inspired artist Empress Of diversifies Friday’s lineup with upbeat experimental electronic and dream pop vibes. With a stage name inspired by a tarot card reading, Lorely Rodriguez has toured with the likes of Florence and the Machine and draws audiences with bilingual tracks on her 2013 EP “Systems.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Singer-songwriter Erykah Badu will continue Empress Of’s genre shift to bring psychedelic, surreal vibes to the Main Green. Badu’s ethereal voice — made prominent by her 2010 LP “New Amerykah Part Two: Return Of the Ankh” and her trippy 2015 mixtape “But You Caint Use My Phone” — carries tunes that could likely make anyone “put (their) phone down.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Sounds of the British electro-pop duo AlunaGeorge and American indie-influenced garage rock band Cherry Glazerr offer contrasts to Badu’s chromatic tracks on Saturday. Nominated for Critic’s Choice at the BRIT Awards and placing second in the BBC’s annual rising artist poll in 2013, AlunaGeorge offers feel-good dance music influenced by garage genre themes while Cherry Glazerr’s angsty, percussive sound evident on “Apocalypstick” is prime for a day concert scene. Providence’s staple brass band What Cheer? Brigade will return on Saturday for their annual setlist.</span></p>

		<title>Jayna Zweiman ’01 brings her ‘Pussyhats’ to campus</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Posters of “Pussyhats” peppered campus for days before the Visual Arts Department welcomed back alum and Pussyhat Project co-founder Jayna Zweiman ’01. Zweiman spoke at the List Art Center yesterday about life events that led to the creation of the Women’s March’s now-iconic cat-shaped headwear.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I knew right away that we needed to bring her back to Brown and embrace her and celebrate this phenomenal project that she developed and co-founded,” said Professor of Visual Art Wendy Edwards, the chair of the visual arts department.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Zweiman became interested in knitting after she sustained a head injury three and half years ago. She had long been curious about the medium of thread and the idea of “using a line and turning it into a space,” she said. Knitting was also a form of creative expression that required no cleanup — an activity for which she did not have the energy due to her injury. “Having a form of disability can inform your art,” Zweiman said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She and her future Pussyhat Project co-founder Krista Suh subsequently joined a knitting community based in a Los Angeles yarn shop called The Little Knittery.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Zweiman says it was President Trump’s victory in the election that sparked the inspiration for the “Pussyhat.” “Out of that devastation, Krista and I went to the Little Knittery and started talking about the Women’s March,” Zweiman said. Both were motivated to start a movement that reacted to the presidential win and would empower women into action everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If everyone wore hats, we could create visibility for this march,” Zweiman said. They wanted the “Pussyhat” to be a way for people who might not be able to attend the Women’s March in D.C. for financial, health or disability reasons to be included in the movement anyway, she added. The goal was for people around the country to be able to participate and make a statement if they wanted to.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To this end, volunteers across the United States individually crocheted, knitted and sewed bright pink hats with two little cat ears. These hats were either worn by their maker, given to a friend or stranger to wear at a march or shipped to the Pussyhat Project to be redistributed to protestors. The exchange of hand-made hats symbolizing a feminist movement aimed to create a national sense of community and solidarity, according to Zweiman. The success of the hat soon became evident as millions of women wore the hat internationally for the Women’s March and the International Women’s Day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the question and answer section of the talk, one student referenced the fact that critics of the hat have suggested that the word “pussy” in “Pussyhat” excludes transgender women from the movement. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think it is really important to listen to what people have to say in terms of criticism,” Zweiman said. The name “Pussyhat” was used in response to the Donald Trump scandal involving the non-consensual grabbing of female genitalia. In a wider sense, the word “pussy” is used in a derogatory fashion to relate to an individual’s female characteristics, Zweiman said. “Pussyhat” is trying to reclaim that word, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Zweiman herself was not able to attend the Women’s March due to her past head injury, she gave her hat to a stranger to wear at the march. In this sense, the “Pussyhat” fulfilled its mission to involve everyone in the Women’s March, regardless of their location or circumstances, she said. “In this political climate, it is really important that people stand up for what they are worried about,” Zweiman said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Unearthed Fitzgerald story offers new insights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">“It fulfills all the requirements of fiction: it is one long sweet lie,” wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald in “The I.O.U.,” a previously unpublished short story that came out posthumously Monday in the New Yorker. The quote comes from a conversation between two of the short story’s central characters — a fraudulent publisher and the man who his publishing house has publicly pronounced dead in its most recent nonfiction book. Here, Fitzgerald offers a taste of his self-aware sense of humor in his ability to poke fun at the publishing industry.</p>
<p class="p4">According to the New Yorker, Fitzgerald wrote “The I.O.U.” in 1920 for fashion magazine Harper’s Bazaar. Fitzgerald dubbed many of his own short stories “trash,” sending these texts to publishers for fast-profit. By the time he wrote “The I.O.U.,” Fitzgerald had become fairly well-known, acquiring the means to focus on novel writing. He rescinded the initial submission of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the story’s manuscript, claiming he planned to add some revisions before publishing. He then abandoned the story altogether and turned to writing the “The Beautiful and the Damned.” In 2012, Fitzgerald’s estate sold “The I.O.U.” to Yale, along with 14 other of his unpublished short stories, which will come out Apr. 25 in a collection called “I’d Die for You: And Other Lost Stories,” edited by Anne Margaret Daniel.</p>
<p class="p4">“The I.O.U.” revolves around a New York City publisher who recently released “The Aristocracy of the Spirit of the World,” an autobiography written by character Dr. Harden. The book recalls Dr. Harden’s communications with his nephew, Cosgrove Harden, which occur after he was supposedly killed in World War I. Cosgrove, who is, in fact, very much alive, discovers the falsified text claiming his death in a chance encounter with the publisher on a train. Upon confrontation, the publisher defends his decision to market the text as nonfiction, claiming, “non-fiction is a form of literature that lies halfway between fiction and fact.” Following this episode, journalists swarm the publisher, exposing the fraud.</p>
<p class="p4">Since the story’s publishing, many media organizations have drawn a parallel between this fabricated autobiography and the contemporary infiltration of fake news.</p>
<p class="p4">This story exhibits many of the themes for which Fitzgerald is well-known. He develops a character who, like himself, has been thoroughly impacted by World War I. The central conflict revolves around the publisher’s desire to commodify a soldier’s story, reducing contemporary tragedy into material for the “Great American Public” to devour. Fitzgerald too made his living off of stories about World War I, which — through the lens he casts in this story — makes for an uncomfortable reassessment of his later novels. This concept reflects the post-World War I culture, which is <span class="s3">haunted by new revelations on the human condition and the issue of how to address large-scale tragedy in the media. Fitzgerald meanwhile examines his own pertinent moral discomfort in balancing art and profit through his characters. </span></p>
<p class="p4">In his witty short story, presented as a conversational narrative punctuated with dramatic irony, Fitzgerald does not fail to touch on his most recurrent themes — love and death.</p>
<p class="p4">Fitzgerald often juxtaposes humorous dialogue and underlying morbid material to highlight the comical aspects of the existential crises that were known to plague the author. For example, Cosgrove and the publisher later request that Dr. Hardin dies within ten years to keep reputations safe in the wake of fraud. “Humor is out of place in this discussion. If you’ll make an honest agreement to die, with no mental reservations — ” he requests.</p>
<p class="p4">Fitzgerald closes the piece with the publisher’s hopeful and ironic call for manuscripts about love, which he feels confident will sell better. “Love is a sure thing — it takes a living man to love,” he says. Again, Fitzgerald discloses what could be a baser motivation for the content of his books such as “The Great Gatsby” or “Tender is the Night.” Is love the driving force behind Fitzgerald’s work or just a way to turn a profit?</p>
<p class="p4">In Fitzgerald’s typical fashion, the concise short story plays with existential crises in the midst of interpersonal interactions in post-World War I America. Though the story is lacking in Rosemary-style romance, East Egg alcoholism or corrupted heirs, readers instead encounter a quippy, sardonic reflection on the literary world, which showcases Fitzgerald’s immense skill in writing on dynamic themes that appeal to the co<span class="s4">ntemporary reader. Whether the story reveals Fitzgerald’s discomfort with the politics of the publishing world or with his own motivations in writing to cater to his readership, the story ultimately offers new insight into a writer that has almost become a character himself in the literary canon.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Live-action ‘Beauty and the Beast’ retells timeless classic</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Beauty and the Beast” revels in the nostalgia of its source material — at times, to a fault. The live-action remake of Disney’s 1991 animated classic smashed box office records with a $170 million opening week in North America, but critics remain divided in their responses to the film. Certainly, the refurbished product will have its detractors: rooting its appeal in cloning the original, “Beauty and the Beast” begs the question of what its existence actually adds to the Disney canon. And yet, despite my best efforts, I could not help but surrender to the charming sentimentality of its spectacle. For any who traffic in the nostalgia and delight found in Disney musicals, “Beauty and the Beast” will thrill as an enchanting Baroque reverie.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> The plot follows Belle, played by Emma Watson, whose affinity for books and invention earns her the ire of those in her provincial French town. Since her character’s creation in 1991, Belle has been a thorny subject for feminist scholarship — to some, her literary proficiency and creative spirit represent the veneer trappings of agency, rather than real agency itself. But “Beauty and the Beast” is a period piece, and thus requires setting Belle in contrast to the 18th century cult of gendered anti-intellectualism. Unlike the original, the live-action remake establishes its protagonist as the only literate woman in her town. The performance of reading assumes an active form of feminist resistance, rather than a mere character quirk.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> The titular Beast, a disgraced former prince played by Dan Stevens, later imprisons Belle. The Beast and his cursed former castle servants have been transformed into monsters and house-hold items, doomed to exist in their physical prisons forever lest the Beast open his heart enough to fall in love — and be loved in return. The nature of the fairytale raises ethical and psychosexual questions about the potential for an organic relationship between Belle and the Beast. Certainly, there are elements of Stockholm syndrome at work here, and revisiting that dynamic does “Beauty and the Beast” no favors. Belle quickly succumbs to her captivity in a manner that is incongruous with her personality. Yet, director Bill Condon navigates this terrain delicately, taking care to explore the budding romance in a manner that emphasizes the pair’s common background. Both have been publicly branded as outcasts and find tenderness in that shared experience. The use of CGI helps to tame the Beast in a way that the 1991 animated film never could — Stephen’s eyes and facial ticks betray a certain sensitivity, offering a window into the monster’s ultimate humanity.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> The film’s live-action approach both expands and limits its imaginative boundaries. The castle’s animated household items in particular are hampered by the medium’s commitment to realism, as they appear lifeless and devoid of real expression despite the legends voicing them such as Ian McKellen, Ewan McGregor and Emma Thompson. The limits of computer animation also undermine the fairytale moment of Belle and the Beast’s famous dance scene — seeing the awkwardness of their movements breaks the spell the film has built up over the first hour.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the same time, the interplay between human actors and their CGI counterparts can be incredibly charming. Indeed, the film finds its soul in the interactions between Belle and the household items. Condon displays a real knack for blending the theatricality of musicals with the live-action genre: the beloved “Be Our Guest” number, sung by McGregor’s animated candlestick, Lumiere, is downright cheeky in its nod to Broadway stage productions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moreover, the film’s cinematography is stunning. Condon’s camera frames bodies against such enchanting French Rococo set pieces that it’s impossible not to get lost in the castle’s magic. The film’s color palette is astounding. Rarely has gold been put to such good use: the castle’s brilliant hues radiate warmth and subtly pull viewers into the film’s spell, while silkier tones play upon lighting and reflected surfaces. Gold soaks every frame, evoking the kind of nostalgic fantasy the film hopes to construct inside the imaginations of its viewers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> In an “A.V. Club” review, critic A. A. Dowd wrote: “Disney hasn’t even bothered to make a tale as old as time feel new again. The oldness is the selling point.” Dowd may be right: there are moments when “Beauty and the Beast” feels unnecessary, even lifeless. And yet, during too many moments throughout the movie I caught myself smiling, basking in the modern visual spectacle of a timeless classic.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Drake’s genre-hopping dooms ‘More Life’</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/04/drakes-genre-hopping-dooms-life/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Drake may very well be the most difficult-to-pin-down personality in popular music — a far cry from his once glaring predictability. The musician first made waves with the emotive hip-hop of songs like “Take Care” and “Marvin’s Room,” effectively bridging the gap between romantically-frustrated emo and the showy, vulgar rap made famous by Young Money labelmate Lil Wayne. Drake’s distinctive style of confessional rap, poked fun at by thousands of internet memes, became a calling card for the artist. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But by 2013, the rapper began expanding his career-defining dejection to broader territory on the LP “Nothing Was The Same,” fluctuating between the hardened persona featured in the aggressive cut “Worst Behavior” and the more straightforward pop of his infectious single “Hold On, We’re Going Home.” The erstwhile “sadboy” continued this experimentation on his critically-acclaimed 2015 mixtape “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late,” cementing his newly assertive image with the mix’s bold, in-your-face trap instrumentation and soon-to-follow disses directed at fellow rapper Meek Mill. Highly anticipated “Views” dropped in 2016, further complicating his personal brand — this time, to profound disappointment. The blatant misogyny of tracks like “Child’s Play” evinced a less-than-endearing aspect of Drake’s aggression, while chart-toppers like “Hotline Bling” reflected a descent into treacly and nondescript pop. No longer interesting or revelatory, the Drake displayed on “Views” had many fans believing the rapper might have been better off in his formulaic forlornness. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Drake’s latest stroke in artistic formlessness, 2017’s “More Life,” does not resolve the frustrating ambiguity of “Views.” Marketed as a pseudo-playlist of disparate songs rather than a traditional album, the release capitalizes on the rapper’s musical variability. On “More Life,” Drake flirts with everything from Caribbean dancehall to English grime, exploring a breadth of artistic styles. However, just like most dilettantes content to dabble in every discipline under the sun, Drake is successful in capturing a variety of musical influences but fails to succeed in defining his personal brand in the release’s half-baked attempts at genre-hopping. His project, for the most part, includes nothing particularly exceptional, as demonstrated by the awkward efforts<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of “Lose You” and “No Long Talk,” featuring Giggs. By attempting to communicate through such a wide array of genres, Drake ends up saying very little. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The LP, pretentiously labeled as a “playlist,” has just as many guest features as it does musical styles. Luckily, however, the guests are sampled from the different genres Drake explores, adding actual credibility and authenticity to the tracks. These guest cuts often leave Drake out of the spotlight entirely, granting fresh artists culled from diverse genres the opportunity to truly flesh tracks out. The song “4422” displays the deft talents of electronic artist Sampha, while “Get It Together” with South African DJ Black Coffee and British singer Jorja makes for a cathartic piece of South African house music that would have been impossible for the Canadian rapper to create solo. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rather than advertising the work as the sole product of Drake, the album’s (er, “playlist’s”) cover art attributes the music to “October Firm” — a shadowy collaboration that implies a collective effort. And justly so. Indeed, the playlist is often at its best when Drake is left at the wayside, with the guests in full control. On iTunes, Spotify and elsewhere, however, the work is still officially that of Drake, who falls short of the mark relative to most of his guests. To listeners’ dismay, the hip-hop artist is still left at the helm for most tracks. But lead single “Passionfruit,” one of the release’s solo efforts by Drake, stands apart as an irresistible and exceptionally well-crafted song. Drake combines his current world music influences with an infectious chorus that echoes the desperation Drake so exclusively (and exquisitely) sang of in the past. “Passionate from miles away / Passive with the things you say,” he sings. And just as it did on “Views,” the Drake of yesteryear does feel miles away on “More Life.” But for once, Drake actualizes artistic progression toward his newfound cosmopolitan soundscape without sacrificing his beloved and identifiable “sadboy” persona. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Experimentation in music can be a healthy exercise in creativity. Fleetwood Mac, for example, started out as a mid-level blues band seemingly doomed to spend its lifetime mired in mediocrity. Thankfully, they eventually evolved into the “Landslide”-singing and record-shattering soft rock band that history came to know them as. Such trial and error can be necessary early on for an artist. But Drake, 11 years into his career, can no longer afford to vacillate between musical styles. “More Life” is still worth a listen, largely thanks to its guest features. Drake, the shape-shifter and genre-greenhorn, however, is seriously in need of saving and re-defining his personal brand. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bob Dylan’s ‘Triplicate’ revels in nostalgia</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/05/bob-dylans-triplicate-revels-nostalgia/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Listening to “Triplicate,” Bob Dylan’s latest album released Mar. 3, it’s hard to imagine the Dylan who played at Brown in 1964. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though most of the tunes are covers of popular sentimental songs from the early 20th century, Dylan disowned his most recent release’s purported nostalgia in an interview with Bill Flanagan. “It’s not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for the good old days or fond memories of what’s no more,” he told Flanagan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That’s a challenging claim to support. Dylan still defines the length of his albums by how much good quality sound can fit on a record, not a CD, dividing his album into three interrelated 32 minute albums — imagine 16-minute sides of a vinyl. The idea to make a three-part reflective series echoes an earlier Frank Sinatra album, “Trilogy: Past, Present, Future,” released in 1980. Furthermore, the songs on the album are an aggregate of songs made famous by twentieth century standbys such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, John Coltrane and Frank Sinatra. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perhaps the listener interprets the album’s 30 songs as nostalgic because the feelings conveyed in the lyrics and melodies have been delved into for so many years — but that’s because they’re grounded. They’re the “essence of life,” according to Dylan. And maybe he knows — he’s been around for a while now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In fact, songs like “That Old Feeling” and “Sentimental Journey” outdate the veteran songwriter himself, emerging during and even before his very early childhood in Duluth, Minnesota when he still went by Robert Zimmerman. Actually, the album might have been a more obvious soundtrack for the Depression and World War II eras than for today, a time when, Dylan says, “songs are so institutionalized that you don’t realize it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Admittedly, Dylan’s recent career is not flawless. There is undoubtedly something a little cringe-worthy in hearing the same spirited pioneer from the 1960s musical revolution sing fragmented Christmas songs in a tired voice like<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he does in his 2009 release “Christmas in the Heart.” But the album’s searing and somber rendition of “Silver Bells” acts as a prelude to what Dylan reveals in “Triplicate.” Sure, it’s no “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” but that type of track could not work today. Dylan’s perspective has adapted, the music world has evolved and the political atmosphere has changed. Maybe this is why listeners feel their own kind of post-1970 nostalgia listening to the new album.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But it’s not the 1960s, Dylan’s out of Woodstock and there will never be another “Highway 61 Revisited.” Instead, the “Triplicate” listener encounters a new sober, sentimental Dylan with a certain well-deserved gravity. And it’s this heaviness, this entire lifetime, that, layered over “Nashville Skyline” and “Blonde on Blonde,” accomplishes something entirely new in its severe honesty. The songs on “Triplicate” aren’t pop songs — they’re worn-out, they aren’t flashy and they aren’t radio-ready. The tracks challenge the glossy, Nobel-Prize winning, chart-topping career of one of the most influential musicians in history.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When Dylan covers these classics, he performs the equivalent act of what modern musicians have done over and over to his own songs. The songs Dylan plays on “Triplicate” are the “Make You Feel My Love” and the “Wagon Wheel” of World War II. As these early twentieth-century hits begin to lose their traction, an opportunity exists to revive music that drives at what it means to feel anything at all in the most unabashed, and, at times, painful way. It’s not nostalgic to reach for the feeling that ended in the era of jazz and Frank Sinatra — playing these songs is an opportunity to demonstrate universal experiences, which are still very much a part of life today. And who better to take on this challenge than Dylan, the man who wrote the next generation’s standbys?</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wayland &#039;18.5: In “Kedi,” cats charm viewers and locals alike</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Kedi” is not your standard fare of catnip. Known to American audiences as “Nine Lives: Cats in Istanbul,” Director Ceyda Torun’s documentary follows the thousands of felines who roam Istanbul’s busy streets. Playing at Avon Cinema until Thursday, “Kedi” quietly charms in its meditation on a city and the species at its spiritual center.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Vagrant cats dominate Istanbul’s urban landscape, saturating the city’s negative spaces with life. And yet, to call the cats “strays” would dishonor the intricate bonds formed between these creatures and their human neighbors. Indeed, Torun’s documentary succeeds in large part because it never neglects the human elements of its story, granting as much attention to the voices and narratives of people as to the cats that flit in and out of their lives.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The cats are ephemeral in presence only — they leave enduring impressions upon the souls of those they touch. Told in series of modest vignettes, “Kedi” lets local residents breathe life into the adventures of their feline friends, lending a folksy authenticity that feels neither forced nor pretentious. The documentary draws primarily from inhabitants of the city’s less-urbanized quarters, cataloguing the interplay between fishermen and shopkeepers and the cats they feed, shelter and love. In their narration, the locals exhibit a desperate need to ascribe human qualities to their animal counterparts, making claims about shared dialogues and communal frequencies.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Kedi” indulges these perspectives, and cynics are gifted plenty of fodder with which to disparage the documentary’s philosophical stretches. While one resident extolled the virtues of the local feline population for restoring the city’s “joy for life” and “fading sense of humor,” one could almost hear skeptics pooh-poohing such classic European pseudo-intellectual extravagances. And yet, such is the purity of “Kedi” that it’s impossible not to indulge in the local’s belief. The film captures the cats in moments that perfectly reinforce the narration of their human friends — at times mischievous, timid, ambitious and carefree, the cats reflect the full tableau of the human condition.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Torun’s camera moves with feline-inspired grace, gliding at floor-level through the city’s tight corridors. “Kedi” penetrates the private spaces to which the cats retreat — cupboard shelves and dock-side ice boxes teem with newborn kittens, providing little glimpses of life that feel both stolen and sacred. Wider shots frame single cats against the massive backdrop of the city, beautiful landscapes rendered both absurd and sublime by the presence of a feline Easter egg. In Torun’s camera, the cats are, at once, central actors and bit players in the urban theater.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What ultimately emerges from “Kedi” is a pervading sense that the cats provide meaning to the lives of the residents. The documentary casually exposes the interactions between humans and cats as sites of therapeutic rhythm. One man describes having a prolonged mental breakdown years ago, before finding healing in the daily repetition of feeding hundreds of street cats. While his case proves more extreme than most in “Kedi,” nearly every local describes the existence of a restorative connective tissue between human and feline. As one resident says, “a cat meowing at your feet looking up at you, those are the moments we are lucky. They remind us that we are alive.” At its heart, “Kedi” reminds us to look for the beauty in the life around us — even the life at our feet.</span></p>

		<title>Catherine Opie discusses power of photography, art</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Nearly all the seats in the List Art Center Auditorium were filled Wednesday evening as individuals from both inside and outside the University community gathered to listen to professional photographer Catherine Opie speak.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Opie, currently a professor of photography at the University of California at Los Angeles, visited Brown as part of the Visiting Artist series sponsored by the visual art department. She stood in front of a slideshow projection of selected pieces from her impressive body of work, which dates back to the early 1990s. The photographs all differed in medium, including polaroids, platinum prints and, more recently, digital photography.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Much of Opie’s work centers around LGBTQ culture and community, documenting the lives and identities of LGBTQ individuals across the United States. Opie, who identifies as a lesbian woman, emphasized wanting to “humanize” LGBTQ individuals beyond their typical depictions in modern media. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“So much (queer artwork) was being done but was always in (relation) to erotica,” she said. “I really wanted that idea of humanity, and to begin to create a representation of my own community (in my work).” Several of the artist’s series, including “Domestic,” a collection of photos of queer women in domestic relationships from all over the country, exemplify this effort at humanized representation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Other pieces are, in contrast, much more graphic. For example, two of Opie’s self-portraits, “Self-Portrait/Cutting” and “Self Portrait/Pervert,” feature the use of cutting, in which designs were carved into the artist’s skin, leaving bloody contours that were then photographed in high resolution. “Blood is something that’s inside of you. It’s something that you’re taught to be afraid of,” Opie said. “I’m interested in (the idea that) it’s this substance that I don’t really need to fear.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Opie’s work is not limited by genre or subject matter, with photos ranging from snowy landscapes verging on the surreal to intense and personal portraits of close friends. “I traverse a lot of territories and relationships in my medium. … I’m versatile as an image-maker,” Opie said, adding that she did not want to be reduced to “a singular identity” by the content she creates. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Naturally, when the art world began to typecast her portraiture, she transitioned to photographing landscapes, commencing her work on “Freeways,” a series of small platinum prints of Southern California’s highway system. “After the original showing of ‘Pervert,’ there was definitely a huge … buzz around my work in terms of being this young, queer, didactic artist. So I switched it up on everybody by making these little freeways,” Opie said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sometimes Opie’s work is political: She has captured images of former President Barack Obama’s inauguration, as well as Tea Party rallies and the most recent Women’s March — work she describes as “bearing witness at a specific time within American history.” Sometimes it is conceptual: Nowadays, she primarily focuses on allegory and abstraction, a set of what Opie referred to as “post-menopausal works.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To Opie, photography is more than just an art. “(It) holds much more meaning outside of your one self.” Each of her photographs carries a deep personal meaning. For example, much of her portraiture of LGBTQ individuals also serves as a reflection on the devastating impact of the AIDS crisis — “an homage and a mourning of friends that I had to say goodbye to,” Opie said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Ultimately, “art should be about creating dialogue,” Opie said, adding that artists both wield great power and carry great responsibility. For her part, Opie tries to wield that power responsibly, always ensuring that her subjects are comfortable with the images she releases, she said. “I’ve only been sued one time,” she remarked humorously. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Affecting and all too real, Production Workshop’s “Songs I Stole From Anya” movingly captures tumultuous relationships, mental illness and death itself through its depiction of a manically depressed teenage girl. The play, written and directed by Iris Cronin ’19, runs from April 7 to 10 in the PW downspace.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mercurial and iconoclastic, the eponymous character of Anya deals with more than the mood swings and malaise typical of adolescence. She suffers from bipolar disorder, and her capricious episodes oscillate between manic highs and depressive lows, lending credence to her anguish in an exceptionally believable representation of mental illness. Fearful of being a liability, Anya seeks to correct her life as “some indecipherable human typo” with the drug lithium.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Actress Carrie Adams ’17 portrays Anya — a difficult role she deftly performs, carrying Anya’s alternations between elation and depression with remarkable capability. “It was nerve-wracking to me to make sure I was doing it justice,” Adams said. “To just make sure that was I depicting a human being – Anya is not bipolar; she just has bipolar.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While not autobiographical, the play aims to encapsulate Cronin’s own high school experiences with friendships and relationships as someone suffering from mental illness.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I first started writing it in the fall of my junior year of high school,” Cronin said. “Writing it, I was able to come to terms with a lot of stuff I was struggling with. It was an emotionally, very affecting experience.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Conversations between Anya’s friends Chloe and Nicolas constitute the play’s solemn center. Convened in a park on the one year anniversary of Anya’s suicide, the two start off the play in a match of chess that soon turns into an emotionally-charged volley of meditations on their friend. Playful references to French literature, vocal jazz and pot-smoking abound, but such levity is rare. Chloe, a veritable force of personality and Anya’s best friend, reflects on her friend’s predilection toward “Buffy The Vampire Slayer” and Russian curse words, all while recounting some of the insecurities she encountered in her friendship with Anya at the Catholic girls’ school they attended. Nicolas, a wry pianist and Anya’s ex-boyfriend, laments over his reduction of Anya and her mental illness to an idyllic trope: “the manic pixie dream girl with the manic on the side.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The conversations between the two remind us that the trauma of suicide is a two-way mirror which scars the victim and loved ones alike — despair set straight only by moments of communality. Through their expressions of grief and exchanges of humanity, Chloe and Nicolas approach a sense of catharsis. Each friend projects anxiety and mourning on the other, causing the play to end up being almost just as much about them and their mechanism of coping as it is about Anya.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The pair’s praise-worthy rapport is a product of the chemistry shared by actors Erin Malimban ’19 and Ken Lumb ’19. Cronin deliberately talked to every actor that auditioned about the play’s material, filtering for those who connected with it most. In drawing on Adams, Malimban and Lum’s affinity, Cronin effectively curates the perfect cast for the character-driven production.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(We) were on the same page for the entire process, which just helped,” Lumb said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s2">Entering downtown Providence’s Columbus Theater for Friday night’s Earth2Trump Roadshow of Resistance, local community members encountered a wide array of booths and petitions offering everything from the opportunity to sign senate-bound postcards to the chance to pick up free endangered species-themed condoms. Closer to the main stage, speakers blasted popular hits by ’60s and ’70s bands such as Canned Heat and The Mamas and the Papas alluding to a history of protest. A dancer in a polar bear suit grooved to the music, adding a cheerful element to an otherwise politically charged event. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> Earth2Trump Roadshow of Resistance, affiliated with the Center for Biological Diversity, showed how performance can function as protest, featuring a series of acts that addressed President Trump’s policies, particularly those that pertain to indigenous peoples’ rights and environmental degradation. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“There (are) so many ways to resist,” said Brytnee Laurette, an activist and speaker touring with the roadshow. “A lot of people think that, you know, to be an activist you have to be on the frontline … I think art is activism. There’s a word for it, too, it’s ‘artivism.’” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Planning for the show began in November, following the election, and the first tour began in January, Laurette said. In addition to speeches by Laurette, the show includes performances by musicians Lyla June and Casey Neill and features speeches from activist and Lakota elder Cheryl Angel. Earth2Trump has already toured the West Coast and the South, and throughout April, it will continue to tour the Northeast. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">During Friday’s performance, Laurette took the stage just after 7 p.m., thanking local tribes for allowing the roadshow space on their land. A Narragansett family joined her, offering a local standpoint on global issues by pointing out that the city of Providence is not guiltless in the nation’s affronts to indigenous peoples. The parking lot of the Providence mall<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>covers an ancestral burial ground, noted a speaker. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Cheyenne and Diné artist Lyla June’s performance followed Laurette’s comments. She began with a hip-hop piece focused on the political issues the show hoped to tackle. Afterwards, she sang piercing, hopeful and, at times, sorrowful songs, addressing environmental issues and indigenous rights today. Casey Neill came next, bringing a slightly more positive attitude, suggesting that people “find one issue (they) care about and dig in.” He invited audience members to join the dancer in the polar bear suit and himself on stage for his song “Ice Bear,” which centers around endangered polar bears. “Critters don’t have voices,” Neill crooned.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Angel spoke about the immense challenges she faced protesting at Standing Rock. She described standing on the frontlines wearing goggles on nights she felt sure she would face arrest. Bringing her hands together, she suggested two ways of resisting: prayer and action. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Throughout her speech, Angel offered a message of intergenerational hope and respect. She joined June in a prayer for Syria following Friday’s missile strike. Angel finished the show with another prayer.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Sometimes it’s hard and you lose hope,” Laurette said. On the tour, she wants to create a space to “share and learn from people just traveling through.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Invasion!’ challenges audiences, casts light on Muslim experiences</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">Who is Abulkasem? The question pervades “Invasion!,” Sock and Buskin’s latest production about the Muslim experience in the Western world. The play is not easy to describe — nor should it be. At its most basic level, the show is a series of intersecting vignettes that trace the ethereal identity of a figure the characters hold to a near-mythological status. At its loftiest, it is a scathing critique of the way American society treats Muslims and other marginalized communities. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The play opens with a coup de theatre, a playful prank on the audience that director Ashley Teague MFA’17 asks us to bear with in her program. From there, viewers follow a series of scenes — rowdy high school students disrupting a class trip, flirtation and harassment in a dive bar, an unreliable Greek chorus consisting of a panel of “experts” and so on. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Certain vignettes stand out for their talented execution, their poignancy and their richness. Chief among them is a scene in which an immigrant apple picker hires a translator to tell his story. As he professes his love for ABBA in Arabic, the interpreter provides intentionally mistranslated English depictions of increasingly stereotypical acts. “I burn the American flag and the Israeli flag!” the translator falsely claims the man is saying, right before the apple picker dances energetically to “Waterloo.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Haunting the apple picker’s waking hours are repeated calls from Abulkasem, a nerdy young man who used a fake name to pick up a girl at a bar. The girl gave him a fake number — one that turned out to be the apple picker’s, and so Abulkasem has been repeatedly pestering the apple picker under the impression that he is reaching the object of his desire. The name Abulkasem is used throughout the play as a pseudonym, a legend, a scapegoat and a metaphor. The name, of course, stands in for the skewed Western perception of Muslim people, but anyone can be Abulkasem. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Who is Abulkasem?” the playbill asks. “Is it you?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Near the end, a panel of pseudo-experts — one of whom is named, appropriately if bluntly, Arnold Drumpt — erupts into a frenzy over the need to track, identify and capture yet another nebulous Abulkasem. One of the panelists shows a video montage of Western depictions of Arabic people, featuring everything from Disney’s Aladdin to CNN reports, and points to every other character, claiming that he — no, him — no, her — is Abulkasem. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Why does Abulkasem matter?” the moderator asks exasperatedly. No one answers, for no one cares. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many of the vignettes cannot be done justice in a brief review. The often wraithlike movements of the characters on stage, the nuance of the dialogue and the brilliance of the structure are all necessary to observe for oneself. And that does not mean simply to watch — this play demands the most of its audience, requiring intent listening, thoughtfulness, open-mindedness and engagement. Perhaps the greatest feat of the play is its implicit refusal to allow passivity. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Attention must also be given to the hyper-talented ensemble cast. Each of them adds an integral component to the show, carrying out multiple roles through the duration of the play while maintaining dramatic tone shifts and quick-changes with elegance and professionalism. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Invasion!” is quite unlike any other contemporary play. Swedish-born writer Jonah Hassem Khemiri’s words, coupled with Teague’s decidedly personal direction and the cast’s skillful acting, has made this show among the strongest of Brown’s performances this year.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thanks to the recent opening of Den Den Korean Fried Chicken, passersby may notice a sudden liveliness near 182 Angell St. Once a quiet, infrequently traversed street, the area now serves as a backdrop to crowds of customers bustling in and out of the restaurant’s front door.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Owned and operated by Den Den Hospitality Group — the enterprise that also owns Den Den Café Asiana on Benefit Street and Kung Fu Tea on Waterman — Korean Fried Chicken opened on March 25. Even from outside, the restaurant’s white brick walls and sleek black awning radiate clean modernity and understated elegance. The interior of the building is just as tastefully furnished, featuring a well-lit two-tiered dining space filled with booths and tables, which can seat dozens of talkative diners.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the eatery’s emphasis on casual dining, its menu reads much like that of a formal restaurant, containing sections dedicated to starters, entrees and desserts. The dishes themselves are far from cheap — entrees average about $12 to $15, with an “extra-large” platter of fried chicken costing a whopping $36. While these prices are hardly unexpected given the expensive menu items at other branches of the Den Den franchise, they make eating at KFC a bit of a splurge. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Menu offerings primarily consist of Korean dishes, such as buckwheat noodles and soondae sausage stir-fry. But some also incorporate elements of Japanese-style cooking: the “Curry Katsu” dish, reminiscent of Japanese Katsu, features a cutlet of chicken, pork, fish or shrimp with a topping of Korean curry.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perhaps justifying the lofty prices, the quality of the cuisine is top-notch. The vegetarian gyoza, pan-fried and delicately wrapped in green dough, burst with flavor; the beef stew features light noodles in a delicious mild broth; the Korean sweet potato fries are complemented wonderfully by their creamy, sweet-sour dipping sauce. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The spicy rice cakes, also known as “Tteok-bokki,” stand out in particular among the menu items. Soft and chewy, stewed with assorted vegetables in a thick, syrupy chili paste, the rice cakes encapsulate the perfect mix of sweetness, salt and spice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast, the eponymous “Den Den Korean Fried Chicken” falls short of expectations. The chicken, which comes in three varieties — Dark (Soy Garlic); Red (Spicy); and White (Lemon Cream) — lacks both flavor and savor. While the texture is delectably crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, there is nothing striking about the taste. None of the three flavors linger, and all fail to make customers crave more. All in all, the fried chicken is simply not the capstone dish expected by the restaurant’s name.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite its expensive menu, Den Den Korean Fried Chicken boasts a strong and varied selection of dishes, a clean and pleasant atmosphere and, most importantly, good food. Two weeks in, the latest addition to Thayer’s dining scene continues to entertain a hefty influx of customers and promises to do so for a long time.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wayland &#039;18.5: “Donald Cried” fails to deliver more than laughs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">“Donald Cried” may fail to rise to its inconsistent flashes of brilliance but nonetheless delivers a story rife with comedic flair. Playing at Avon Cinema on Thayer Street until Thursday, the film follows a New York financier who returns to his aggressively working-class Rhode Island hometown to handle the affairs of his recently-deceased grandmother. In the opening scene, Peter, played by Jesse Wakeman, leaves his wallet on he bus and thus must rely on the help of his childhood best friend, Donald, for the duration of the movie.</p>
<p class="p4">In his directorial feature debut, Kris Avedisian stars as Donald, a character who remains faithful to quirky traditions of the man-child archetype, a trope made famous by jesters like Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler. But as Mike D’Angelo of “A.V Club” points out, “unlike (those characters) he superficially resembles … this emotionally stunted loser is meant to inspire a certain degree of pathos, as the film’s title suggests.”</p>
<p class="p4">Indeed, while Donald exists to provide the film’s comedic backbone, he also adds nuance and depth to a story otherwise built upon the foundation of Wakeman’s solid, if unmemorable, straight man. Donald’s random and rambling sermons are impressive attempts to plumb the realm of the absurd for laughs, but they also offer a window into a mind that is far more refined than the average Ferrell farce. Moreover, there’s a certain thrill to not knowing where Donald’s speeches will lead — in one scene, a casual conversation reminiscing about high school veers into a story about a twisted lineage worthy of the Jerry Springer Show.</p>
<p class="p4">Avedisian’s approach to comedy finds humor not only in Donald’s absurd non sequiturs but also in Peter’s incredulity and the suffocating silences that follow. The camera has a knack for reinforcing the humor inherent in the pair’s dynamic, placing Peter in nearly every shot in which Donald delivers a humorous line. Using one camera to frame two men who see the world through such diametrically-opposed lenses isn’t just a device to extend the humor — it’s an ingenious approach that helps the audience better delve into the souls of the characters.</p>
<p class="p4">Death proves a particularly strong site for humor in “Donald Cried.” In one scene, Peter and Donald attempt to spread the ashes of Peter’s grandmother along a riverbank, and hilarity ensues. Donald provides an intensely funny and inappropriate eulogy before asking “Can I do one?” — a wonderful and ridiculous way to phrase a request to toss ashes.</p>
<p class="p4">While set exclusively in Warwick, Rhode Island, “Donald Cried” at times feels like a roadie flick. The men drive to various childhood haunts while finding themselves in increasingly ludicrous situations, a la the forgettable 2010 film, “Due Date.” Of course, “Donald Cried” exists on an entirely superior plane to “Due Date” in both its comedic approach and the strength of its human drama. But therein lies the ultimate problem with the film — it struggles to incorporate Donald’s natural cringe comedy into the complex and troubling relationship between the two protagonists.</p>
<p class="p4">The quality of Avedisian’s direction and writing is such that the movie shouldn’t have to choose between comedy and drama. Indeed, the movie soars in the moments when its humor informs the pathos. In one scene, Peter discovers that Donald has spent the past six years tricking Peter’s dementia-addled grandmother into believing that he, Donald, is in fact Peter. The scene proves a comedic goldmine but also more subtly reveals the dynamics of Peter and Donald’s relationship, one riddled with dark undercurrents of idolization and abuse. The movie suffers when Avedisian forgets that the relationship between childhood best friends provides the movie’s ultimate pulse rather than the comedy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b>The literary arts department hosted a memorial tribute Tuesday for Michael S. Harper, who joined the University as an English professor in 1970 and retired from the literary arts department in 2013. Harper passed away in May 2016.</p>
<p class="p4">“Over the course of his four and a half decades of teaching here, Michael Harper mentored generations and generations of students and writers,” said Peter Gale Nelson, professor and academic program director of literary arts.</p>
<p class="p4">Anthony Walton ’87, who graduated with a master’s degree in poetry, was among the students profoundly impacted by Harper’s guidance. Walton has become a writer and poet himself and returned to campus to address a small crowd of Harper’s friends and colleagues at the John Hay Library. Walton was first exposed to Harper’s poetry in a textbook he had his junior year of high school. The inclusion of African American culture in Harper’s poetry made a lasting impression on Walton’s conception of the art form, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Harper believed the poet “is someone who keeps the truth alive until people are ready for it,” Walton said.</p>
<p class="p4">An example of this preserved truth includes Harper’s poem about the Algiers Motel incident. On July 25, 1967, during the 1967 Detroit riot, the annex of the Algiers Motel was seized by the authorities, following a report of a gunman. Three black civilians were murdered and an additional nine people were beaten by the Detroit Police Department, the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Army National Guard. A film about the incident titled “Detroit” is set to come out this summer.</p>
<p class="p4">Harper “wrote his poem about this incident in the late ’60s. Now, 50 years later, the nation is ready to start thinking about it,” Walton said.</p>
<p class="p4">Robert Stepto, professor of English and African American studies at Yale and lifelong friend of Harper, also came to the memorial tribute to say a few words about his friend and colleague. Together, Stepto and Harper co-edited “Chant of Saints: A Gathering of Afro-American Literature, Art, and Scholarship.” Stepto met Harper in 1969: “We had many good times together,” he said. “It is abundantly clear that Michael fell into (the category of) ‘the speech that would have some influence on the world,’ as (Harper) called it.”</p>
<p class="p4">His work has been honored with fellowships, honorary degrees and an appointment as the first poet laureate of Rhode Island, as well as prizes including the Robert Hayden prize, the Black Academy of Arts and Letters prize, the Melville-Cane Award and the 2008 Robert Frost medal for lifetime achievement, Stepto added.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Michael Harper’s poetry is infused not only with the rhythms of music but also with an eye and an ear attentive to history and current events,” Nelson said. “He used poetry to foreground terrible realities that have necessitated many transformations for and within this nation — realities that include cultural and political racism, ongoing struggle for equality and a never-ending need to bear witness to our collective past and, in doing so, to construct the basis for a better, more just future.”</span></p>
<p class="p4">The McCormack Family Theater hosted a follow-up event to gather students, faculty and friends to honor Harper with a poetry reading accompanied by music.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Pure Comedy’ ambitious in scope, fails to impress</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">David Foster Wallace’s “Infinite Jest” graces many college students’ bookshelves, and for good reason. Captivating and extensive in subject matter, the novel tackles everything from tennis to substance abuse to the pitfalls of the entertainment industry. At more than one thousand pages, it is a lot to unpack. But Wallace leaves even the novel’s bloated digressions on the mechanics of telephones as readable. Heralded in some circles as the pinnacle of modern literature, the work carries a critical legacy even more formidable than its door-stopping size. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Father John Misty, the sardonic stage persona of Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter and internet troll John Tillman, takes a great deal from the gospel of David Foster Wallace on his latest record “Pure Comedy.” A sprawling 74-minute-long double album critical of everything under the sun, “Pure Comedy” is similar in ambitious to “Infinite Jest” in terms of size and scope. On the album, Tillman’s third as Father John Misty, irony-laden shots are fired not only at the media and its glut of vanity-driven popular artists — victims Tillman dubs “the comedy of man” on the title track — but also at the singer-songwriter himself. Thematically, it is remarkably similar to “Infinite Jest,” with the morbid and technophobic imagery of “Total Entertainment Forever” seemingly lifted directly from Wallace’s magnum opus. The album’s sweeping and ostensibly self-aware grandiosity wants so badly to replicate Wallace’s work with its meta and barbed critique of society. But Tillman, in a fundamental misreading of Wallace, ends up falling even flatter than the media and pop stars he sets out to skewer, at least lyrically. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not unlike many of the literarily-inclined and clove-smoking aesthetes that attend liberal arts colleges everywhere, Tillman conflates “high” culture with social capital. Intellectualism is cool — a fact he reminds audiences of with every vacuous and cringe-inducing lyric on the album. Corny allusions to literary figures and vague references to technophobic doom are abound on “Pure Comedy,” each one more half-baked and nebulous than the last. The songwriting of tracks like “Leaving LA,” which affirms that “the role of Oedipus was a total breeze,” leaves the listener thinking the album might be best retitled “Pure Torture.” With an analysis that is closer to a B+ ninth grade book report on “Infinite Jest,” the one-dimensional references to media theories and academic texts promote more of a stroking of Tillman’s cynical ego than any meaningful metacommentary. Rather than seeing his supposed depth of acerbic cultured insight as a means of shedding truth on this troubled world, Tillman seems to view his art as a vehicle for his own vanity. In the process, he embarrasses himself, coming across as that kid in section who pretends to have done the readings, or even worse, that guy who goes to bars to mansplain the works of Simone de Beauvoir.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Outside of a few sincere one-liners, the songwriting is beyond clunky. But the most egregious aspect of the album might be its broader cynicism — an omniscience that serves as a crutch for actual emotion. Tillman’s brand of post-modern critique used to be hilarious and at least a little affecting. “Bored in the USA,” a track off his last album “I Love You Honeybear,” was a laugh track-lined musical critique of society that remained self-conscious of musical critique’s lack of potency, making for an incredibly interesting listen when it dropped in 2015. Tillman’s cynicism on “Pure Comedy,” however, rarely reaches such transcendence. Tillman eviscerates pop star Taylor Swift on “Total Entertainment Forever,” but does not substantiate his negativity with any kind of rigorous analysis. It’s simply pretension — phoned-in opinions as vapid as his references to media theory and Plato’s allegory of the cave. The end result is a petty irony no more enlightened than a mocking subtweet at an ex. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Maybe the only selling point to the album is its gorgeous, lush instrumentation. Tillman may not be that sincere, but as a former drummer for the ethereal indie act Fleet Foxes, he knows a thing or two about crafting pretty ballads. Wallace’s prose was cold and clinical, but Tillman’s songs, mostly mid-tempo, are warm and pleasant to the ear. At times, his crooning and fragile voice even seems to imply actual feelings. But it’s all too good to be true — Tillman, in another of his grating post-modern tricks, is probably just appropriating popular, unassuming harmonies to convey his affected message to the masses. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Irony and satire — if done right — can resound beyond themselves and affect true change. Most of the time though, in this Internet-saturated era, such stylized critiques devolve into a lazy and ineffectual way of coping with the world — a pervasive theme in Wallace’s oeuvre. The only entertaining irony on the album is Tillman’s complete misinterpretation of this concept. Like so many undergraduates with half-finished copies of “Infinite Jest,” he misses the point entirely. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Wednesday, food truck Rocket Fine Street Food, run and owned by couple Patricia Natter-Meneguzzo and Joe Meneguzzo, stopped on Waterman Street during lunch time and sold out of everything in two hours. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The truck features a space-themed menu peppered with references to Star-Trek, Star Wars and various celestial bodies. “I like science fiction, and I have a sense of humor, so I like to work the two together and hopefully entertain and inform people as to what we are and what we are doing,” Meneguzzo said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My mother always wanted me to be an astronaut, so I didn’t let her down,” he quipped.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Providence-based truck has made a name for itself with its egg sandwiches, hot dogs and burgers prepared with local and organic ingredients. According to Rocket’s website, the business strives to provide customers with cuisine that meets only the highest standards:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Our philosophy is simple. Throughout our menu we use the highest quality ingredients in their purest form.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Always involved and interested in cooking, Meneguzzo “grew up in his Italian grandmother’s kitchen, and I grew up baking at home,” Natter-Meneguzzo said. Going into the food service business was something they always wanted to do, but having no prior experience, they felt that managing a restaurant would be too much to handle, Natter-Meneguzzo added. Now, Natter-Meneguzzo handles the window and administrative responsibilities while Meneguzzo cooks each dish. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Inspired by the food truck trend that started in the early 2000s on the West Coast, Natter-Meneguzzo said the couple felt they were up to managing a truck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We decided that we (were) going to do it, quit our jobs, pack everything, move back to New England and start the Rocket,” Natter-Meneguzzo said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 2010, the couple started their business in northwest Connecticut, but, after a year and a half, moved to Providence — a small city with lots of pedestrian traffic and great food culture, Natter-Meneguzzo noted. Today, the couple mainly operate in Providence but also travel around Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts to cater birthday parties, weddings or graduation parties, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the truck has proved much more work than the couple anticipated, it has been extraordinarily rewarding to engage with customers and hear their feedback, Natter-Meneguzzo said. “It is a different dynamic than what you get at a restaurant,” she added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Intermission/Interruption/Intervention</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Join Rhode Island School of Design students Thursday at 6:30 p.m. for an “anti-salon” as student artist-scholars gather to feature their work and challenge the current “Intermission” exhibit on display in the Chase Center Galleries. “Intermission” features an informal array of European artwork from the early 12th century to the late 19th century. During this anti-salon, museum visitors are encouraged to enter the gallery to witness student additions to the exhibit and engage with students and their work — identifying not just what is featured but what is notably absent.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Improv on the Rocks</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">For those who need a laugh-break from studying Saturday night, Comic Sans will be performing long-form and short-form improv at their free comedy show at 8 p.m. The Brown/RISD comedy troupe promises that “You’ll laugh, cry, die, and be reborn all at once.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Back O’Town</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Watch the senior thesis of Erin J. Reifler ’17 come alive in “Back O’Town: Senior Thesis Musical Theatre Composition” is set to play Friday through Monday in the PW Downspace. The musical, set in August 2005, follows the lives of three black women in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Directed by Uchechukwu Onwunaka ’19, Reifler’s thesis will feature content of medical racism, incarceration, natural disaster trauma, state violence and misogynoir.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>&#039;The Americas on Fire&#039; exhibit to open at JCB</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Under the dimly lit glass cases of the John Carter Brown Library, yellowed manuscripts reveal passages and images printed hundreds of years ago — all of which share one thing in common: fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p4">This Friday marks the official opening of a new exhibition at the JCB: “The Americas on Fire.” The third of a series on the four elements, the exhibit features approximately 50 documents, including manuscripts, maps and other materials gathered from the library’s collection. Spanning the 16th through 19th centuries, the pieces work together to demonstrate the role of fire in “literally fueling” many aspects of pre-colonial and colonial life, said Associate Professor of History and Director of the John Carter Brown Library Neil Safier.</p>
<p class="p4">The exhibit was guest-curated by Jake Frederick, associate professor of history at Lawrence University, and Júnia Furtado, professor of history at Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil, at Safier’s invitation. Both curators were well-suited for the task: Furtado had been discussing the idea of an element-themed exhibition series with Safier for a long time and Frederick was a fellow at the JCB in 2015, when he worked on a project about fire in the Americas. Following exhibits on Earth in 2015 and Air in 2016, the two began the curation process for Fire this January.</p>
<p class="p4">Throughout this process, the researchers shared the responsibility of selecting the documents to be displayed, often working remotely from the JCB’s digital collection. Several factors influenced their consideration of individual pieces, including a desire to “display the depth and breadth of the JCB’s collection,” Frederick said, as well as to create a cohesive narrative for the exhibit as a whole. “We decided what history we would like to tell,” Furtado said. Eventually, they divided their images into six separate categories: “the fires of daily life,” “commodities and consumption,” “fueling colonization,” “fire as foe,” “fires of resistance” and “contact, confrontation and condemnation”</p>
<p class="p4">One of the earliest documents in the collection hails from mid-16th-century Brazil. Drawn from the experience of a German soldier, Hans Staden, who was captured by the indigenous Tupinambá tribe, the image depicts a scene of cannibalism, complete with human limbs roasting over a fire. Staden’s stereotypical portrayal of the Tupinambá was widely circulated after his return to Europe, influencing subsequent colonizers’ representations of native peoples. “For a long time … (this image) was reproduced everywhere,” Furtado said. “It became a stamp (to represent) the Native Americans. It became iconic.”</p>
<p class="p4">Another document, a Spanish manual intended for religious instruction, incorporates elements of indigenous artwork from central Mexico. The manuscript condemns idolatrous speech through a series of pictographs — reminiscent of native Mexican imagery — depicting people both speaking and being punished for spreading blasphemies. “Spaniards were trying to use this native writing genre with their own Spanish twist on it,” Frederick said.</p>
<p class="p4">Collectively, the pieces showcase the many ways in which fire has been used throughout history to both help and hinder human civilization. “Fire is absolutely pervasive in the American experience and in the human experience,” Frederick said. “Looking at fire really can allow you access to any subject that you want to access … It is this very human thing, but it is also this powerful elemental force that can exert force over humans when the mood strikes it.”</p>
<p class="p4">Moreover, “The Americas on Fire” demonstrates that, even when domesticated, fire can be both generative and destructive. “Europeans used fire as a way to explore American nature, … to make American nature profitable,” Furtado said. Nonetheless, she added, “(fire can be) a way to resist colonization, … to break the European power in order to achieve independence.”</p>
<p class="p4">One of the JCB’s current goals is to “draw in undergraduate students who maybe don’t have the chance to do research at the JCB, but might discover primary source material that they could use for a class by visiting our exhibitions,” said Tara Kingsley, coordinator of academic programming and public outreach at the JCB. This entails the expansion of the library’s audience to students outside the traditional realm of the humanities.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As such, “The Americas on Fire” serves as a “jumping off point to think about collaborative and interdisciplinary scholarship,” Safier said. The exhibition coincides with a two-week event sponsored by the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, titled “What Fire Does.” Through this event, the JCB and IBES collaborate to foster dialogue about both the scientific and historical connotations of fire and tie them together in the context of modern day issues, such as global warming, Safier said. He added that he “really (hopes) that … people are inspired to see our collection as useful for understanding the broader history, and the present day controversies, around climate change.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The 67-year-old Spring Weekend remains an irrefutable highlight of the Brown experience. Culled from a variety of genres, each artist booked for Spring Weekend is sure to bring different displays of creativity to the Main Green this weekend. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><strong><span class="s3">Princess Nokia</span></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There’s an extraordinary, almost transfixing quality to Princess Nokia’s hip-hop. Hailing from Spanish Harlem and the Lower East Side of New York, the artist essentially came of age clubbing with New York creatives. This background almost certainly informed her music — heady alternative hip-hop and enchanting R&amp;B seemingly created to soundtrack students’ transcendence of the earthly frame during Spring Weekend. With lyrics that wouldn’t be out of place in an ethnic studies class, Princess Nokia has actual conviction in her intellectualism and black feminism —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>tell your snapback wearing, Lil Dicky-listening roommate to stay home for this one.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Empress Of</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lorely Rodriguez, stage name “Empress Of,” was an early devotee to the cult of Icelandic pop star Bjork. And it shows quite evidently in Rodriguez’s own electro-pop, full of vocal undulations and ethereal instrumentation. Rodriguez’s music, like Bjork’s, carries a mythic quality — a secret to be kept in solidarity by the crowd. Her digital recordings might not translate perfectly to a live setting, but Empress Of’s composed, hypnotic electro-pop is sure to provide Friday’s audience with a much-needed respite from the chaos of the weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Young Thug</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If Kendrick is the undisputed king of hip-hop, Young Thug is the rightful prince. After ascending to fame in 2014 with the single “Stoner,” Young Thug — best known by fans as “Thugger” —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>has enjoyed popular and critical acclaim for his esoteric, heartfelt and just plain fun trap rap. The artist’s distinctive brand of rap, full of swelling brassy beats and overall good vibes, is sure to be a hit at Spring Weekend. Brown students’ sharp humor has never betrayed their nonconformity and social conscience — a quality complimented by Young Thug’s playfulness and defiance of sexuality and gender norms. But don’t laugh at the rapper’s often unintelligible lyrics. His set is Friday’s last, and, after the preceding two artists and a semester’s worth of darties, you’re guaranteed to be slurring your words more than Thugger. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Cherry Glazerr</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cherry Glazerr, a nascent indie rock and noise pop group with an inclination toward harsh sonics and visceral howls, may fail to appeal upon initial listen. But the group’s uniquely acerbic approach to indie pop deserves a chance, at least in a live setting. The outfit’s distorted guitar chords and vocal contortions will demand every ounce of your attention, granting their music an immediacy that’s tolerable if not enjoyable. You don’t have to be a head-banging adolescent to have a good time at Cherry Glazerr’s set. In compliance with the group’s exhortation of the ethos of rock and roll, just sit back and scream along, content to know your Organic Chemistry teaching assistant’s ears will probably start bleeding five seconds into the first song.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>AlunaGeorge</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Describing AlunaGeorge’s music as “left-field” would be like describing Brown students as “left-wing:” a fitting descriptor for sure, but one that doesn’t go nearly far enough in addressing just how singular the music of duo AlunaGeorge — the amalgam of singer-songwriter Aluna Francis and producer George Reid — really is. “You Know You Like It,” the duo’s break-away single and a dorm party staple, is prototypical of the group’s arresting vocals and spacious instrumentals that create the effect of listening to an alien muse. Transported from the dance floor to the Spring Weekend stage, some of the magic of the act might be lost the moment audiences see Reid awkwardly arched over a keyboard. Good thing a smoke sheen will probably be obscuring him from the audience for the duration of the set.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Erykah Badu </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Like co-headliner Young Thug, Erykah Badu is a veritable visionary — albeit one that sings with a more delicate and classically beautiful tonality. Badu, a Los Angeles-based R&amp;B and neo-soul singer, makes music that is anything but contrived. Drawing predictable comparisons to other female R&amp;B singers like Beyoncé and Ciara would be a grave mistake; Badu, rather, recalls D’Angelo in her lush and atmospheric music. The gorgeous and cool Badu, sure to aspire awe in audience members, creates a refined soundscape to get lost in — the perfect panacea for a weekend of unbridled hedonism. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">What began as an inaugural spring “Junior Promenade” in 1898 has since become Brown students’ beloved music-packed and (on good years) sun-soaked Spring Weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This year’s festivities mark the 67th anniversary of the event. Artists Young Thug, Princess Nokia, Empress Of and Cherry Glazerr are among the handful of performers who will join Spring Weekend’s star-studded legacy of artists that range “from Bob Dylan to Janis Joplin, U2 to R.E.M. to Elvis Costello to Bruce Springsteen to James Brown to, more recently, Kendrick Lamar, Snoop Dogg, Major Lazer, Vampire Weekend, M.I.A., MGMT, TV On the Radio, Lauryn Hill, The Roots, The Black Keys, Nas,” and The Flaming Lips, wrote Abby Schreiber ’11 in an email to The Herald. Schreiber served on the Brown Concert Agency, which organizes Spring Weekend, from 2007 to 2011 and acted as booking chair from 2010 to 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though Spring Weekend officially began in 1950, the first record of a spring celebration at Brown dates back to 1898, The Herald previously reported in 1897. The Junior Class Committee met to discuss the possibility of a Junior Promenade, but while the idea was shut down that year, it resurfaced and was approved in 1898, according to Encyclopedia Brunoniana. Junior Promenade became Junior Week in 1901, which was designed with a longer and more varied program than the singular Junior Prom. The 1901 ancestor of Spring Weekend featured performances by the Mandolin club, the Banjo club and the Glee Club, The Herald previously reported. Following these performances, students gathered for an informal dance backed by the orchestra, a ball game with Andover College, special chapel services and finally the Junior Promenade itself, which was held in Sayles Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This tradition continued until World War II, when, in 1942, Chairman of the Junior Promenade Committee Steward T. MacNeill<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>confirmed the prom “will be greatly modified from previous editions,” due to the ongoing war. In 1949, an All-Campus Weekend replaced the Junior Week and Promenade for one year. Mike Handman ’51, co-chair of the first Spring Weekend committee, confirmed in a 1950 Herald article “that two name musical organizations will be playing on The Hill on the same night.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Spring Weekend had begun.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Spring Weekend of the fifties does not bear much resemblance to that of today. Spring Weekend featured an “Interfraternity Sing Trophy” that was won by Alpha Delta Phi April 27, 1953, The Herald previously reported. The Jabberwocks held a concert, followed by an informal dance with music provided by jazz musician Claude Thornhill and his band. The next day featured an afternoon of crew races, and on Sunday students gathered for a jazz concert — Dave Binder wasn’t around quite yet. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Spring Weekend began in 1950 but evolved into the weekend of concerts as we know it in 1960,” Schreiber wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the 1960s, concerts and shows replaced the formal and informal dances. The New Orleans Jazz Doctors mark the first band to play at Brown in the modern version of Spring Weekend. The Brown Concert Agency was founded in 1960 — the acronym BCA was widely known as the Brown Christian Association before Brown Concert Agency came along. “Spring Weekend has kind of gone in waves — as opposed to one continuous evolution — where there have been many years that featured smaller acts or local bands, and there are also cycles where the BCA has been able to bring bigger national acts,” Schreiber wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In 1962, Ray Charles came to perform, followed by Ella Fitzgerald in 1965 and Tina Turner in 1972. Bruce Springsteen played at Brown April 16, 1974, The Herald previously reported. Tickets were sold for $10 each in an effort to make them affordable. “Tickets to all the shows will be within everyone’s budget,” said Brad Finley ’76, a BCA representative, at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The 1985 edition of Spring Weekend came with a catchphrase and a theme, The Herald reported. That year’s “Bear on the Beach” kicked off with beach barbeque outside the tropical location of the Graduate Center Bar and ended with a midnight organ concert. The catchphrase “Take Life S/NC” was embraced in an effort to capture the spirit of the music festival, which showcased R.E.M. that year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Until 1991, Spring Weekend also served alcohol. Dean Forsberg, director of student activities at the time, “speculated that the (Brown Concert Agency) had decided not to serve alcohol because of cost and potential liability problems.” Though not quite the same but still in the spirit of binging, booze was replaced with a pie-eating contest on the Main Green. The ’90s welcomed artists like A Tribe Called Quest and Joan Jett.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In 2009, BCA made the switch to electronic tickets. “Spring 2008 we were still selling paper tickets and students had to wait and camp out in Faunce and skip classes and totally disrupt their days and schedules for the chance to buy tickets,” Schreiber wrote. “Understandably this wasn’t an ideal system, and kids would get frustrated and upset because they’d waste a whole day and sometimes still not get a ticket.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This 119-year-old tradition of spring gatherings is furthered by the BCA’s continued efforts to bring up-and-coming musicians to campus. As James Hinton ’10, who was on the board of the BCA in 2010 and helped book that year’s Spring Weekend, which featured MGMT, Major Lazer, the Black Keys and Snoop Dogg, said, “The idea is to try to get people who are on the come-up and not really trying to play the game that some of the bigger schools with much bigger budgets play, where they can get the most popular current set of artists that are blowing up the charts.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A few blocks off College Hill, Providence’s story pours into the streets through murals, which form a tangible fabric for the city that extends beyond Brown and the Rhode Island School of Design and onto downtown streets. Walking down Washington Street, pedestrians encounter a series of murals on building facades and across various avenues. These murals, integrated with shops, restaurants and galleries provide another way of looking at a city known for its smokestacks and industrial buildings. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Using public art in urban design, we can help encourage people to slow down a little bit, to go out and explore the city a little and see what treasures they can find,” said Yarrow Thorne, founder and artistic director of The Avenue Concept, Providence’s first program designed to support public art.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Standing in a parking lot off Washington, two immense murals dwarf passersby. One depicts a melancholic man sitting at a table decorated with a checkered cloth and staring at a floating ring. Titled “She Never Came,” the mural by artist BEZT depicts a man waiting to propose to his girlfriend — who never showed up to dinner. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The artist painted a portrait of Nick Platzer, the mural curator for The Avenue Concept and an advisor to Thorne, Thorne said. BEZT decided he did not want to do a self-portrait and Platzer joked that he should paint his face instead — which the artist took seriously, allowing Providence citizens the opportunity to see a giant Platzer painted on the wall. “It’s pretty awesome,” Platzer added. “It’s definitely an ego-booster.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The other mural, facing the man, portrays a little girl wearing her backpack entering a door into a “crazy mushroom fantasy world,” Platzer said. Painted by Natalia Rak, Polish muralist and then-fiancée of BEZT, the mural faces “She Never Came,” contradicting the more melancholic work with its array of bright pinks and purples. After the installation of these two murals downtown, local businesses noticed a rise in sales, Platzer said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A couple of blocks away lies perhaps the most formidable of downtown mural endeavors. Shepard Fairey, a RISD graduate known for his ubiquitous “HOPE” portrait of former President Barack Obama, painted a tribute to Providence that illuminates the city’s landmarks in bold shades of red, black and white. “Providence Industrial” depicts a rugged and foreboding cityscape, paying tribute to Providence’s eclectic architecture. The piece was commissioned in 2010 by AS220, an organization that seeks to create a space for freedom of expression, said Shey Rivera, artistic director of AS220. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Adjacent to Fairey’s piece is another mural designed by Aaron Peterman and commissioned by AS220. This work contains an excerpt from the poem “Ode to Censorship” by Latinx performance artist Guillermo Gómez-Peña, set against a dark backdrop. The bold colors play with Fairey’s mural, highlighting an artistic edge interlaced with the industrial aspects of the city through the lyrics’ glorification of a romantic alternative lifestyle. Gómez-Peña’s “work centers around the border — borders meaning ethnicity, geographical, gender, everything … like the borders of human (and) post-human,” Rivera added. “We thought it would be great to push the boundaries of the city a little and have that messaging up to inspire people to take risks.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nearby, “Three Waves for Coastway” by Amy Bartlett Wright depicts a serene ocean scene, highlighting Rhode Island’s relationship with the coast. Further down Washington Street, a series of murals decorate the space between Central High School and Classical High School. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For Platzer, these murals have accomplished a personal goal. According to The Avenue Concept’s website, he was expelled from Classical High School for doing graffiti. But Platzer had always thought about painting the tower between the two schools, he said. Years later, he managed to accomplish this goal in a professional setting when The Avenue Concept hired Mike Shida to paint the smoke tower. In the surrounding courtyard, murals create an imaginative backdrop for the school environment, featuring subjects from the depths of the ocean to the outskirts of space to abstract combinations of geometrical shapes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On an alley off Westminster Street, a block from Washington, a particularly odd mural provides an unconventional juxtaposition of the old and new. On a backdrop of a historical scene of 1800s Providence, two fully-90’s-clad characters stand cross-armed, defacing the otherwise fairly traditional mural. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legend had it that the unpaid artists plastered their images to the originally commissioned piece, said Erminio Pinque, who works at Big Nazo, the puppet performance company that hosts the mural. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bonnie Lee Turner, who painted the mural with her partner of the art duo The Art of Life confirmed the story of the mural in an email to The Herald. “The question is: Why did we paint ourselves into the mural 13-feet-tall, scowling and holding our paint brushes?” she wrote. “Well, this is one of those odd little stories that often find their way into art history books. While not as horrible as Caravaggio killing his opponent over a dispute in a game of tennis, or as tense as Pope Julius whacking Michelangelo with his cane,” the mural has its own, vibrant history. Vincent “Buddy” Cianci, then Mayor of Providence, had been involved in a disagreement with the Police and Firearms Unions, who had commissioned the mural. He refused to provide further funding after The Art of Life had already done extensive research in the community and begun work on the mural, she wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We had talent, but we were inexperienced in writing air-tight contracts. And we made one simple mistake — we trusted a politician,” Turner wrote. Instead of painting over the mural entirely when they didn’t receive compensation for their work — a prospect the team considered — Turner and her partner decided to paint themselves on top of the original mural in order to honor the relationships they had built and the work they had put into the process. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It turned out to be a good thing,” Turner wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aside from the massive murals around Washington Street, various independent murals, city projects and other forms of public art are scattered throughout the city. AS220, specifically, has facilitated projects with youth-artists in the city. Similarly, The Avenue Concept is currently planning a new mural in Providence. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I firmly believe that when you walk into a city and there’s artwork all around, that’s a very big indicator that the city is progressive, that people care about it, that there’s activity happening and that people are invested in the betterment of the city,” Rivera said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><em><strong><span class="s3">Correction: A previous version misstated the name of Erminio Pinque as Minio Pinque. Also, Big Nazo was referred to as a gallery. In fact, it is a puppet performance group. The Herald regrets the error.</span></strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Burgeoning alternative band, The Layovers, shakes College Hill</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b>Recognized as one of Brown’s most precocious musical groups, alternative student rock outfit The Layovers is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>paradoxically bound by its members’ differences. Under its only recently shed moniker ‘Paxsonator,’ the band released two self-produced demos, “Someday” and “Think of Me,” in 2016, and anticipates the release of a proper EP this year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p5"><b>An amalgam of “energies”</b></p>
<p class="p6">The Layovers is made up of Alejandro “Gango” Subiotto Marqués ’19, a magnetic Belgian drummer concentrating in Development Studies, Juan “JJ” Bellassai ’19, a light-hearted Paraguayan bassist and the group’s resident pre-med, Arthur Back ’19, a Parisian guitarist and beam of sincerity pursuing political science and Cameron “Cam” McKie ’19, a British singer and guitarist studying Mechanical Engineering.</p>
<p class="p6">United by their commitment to music and performance, the band members are each unique in their own disparate musical interests.</p>
<p class="p6">“Each individual song has its own individual energy,” said Subiotto Marqués, explaining the band’s unique approach to songwriting. All of the band’s songs start as solitary efforts composed by a single member<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— a songwriting methodology which lends an idiosyncratic flair to each of their tracks. “The songs end up sounding very different. So it’s hard to label ourselves,” Subiotto Marqués added.</p>
<p class="p6">Bellassai, an avowed fan of Green Day and Blink 182, brings a pop-punk influence, while Back tends towards melodies reminiscent of softer southern and country folk in the vein of Jack Johnson. Subiotto Marqués singularly offers more hip-hop and funk-influenced tracks. McKie’s writing echoes contemporary British indie artists like The 1975 and Mumford &amp; Sons.</p>
<p class="p6">“I actually learned how to play guitar through Mumford &amp; Sons,” McKie said. A devotee of the British Isles’ indie rock, McKie evokes this more understated brand of music with his contributions to the band’s oeuvre.</p>
<p class="p5"><b>A Hard Day’s Night </b></p>
<p class="p6">The group lamented certain obstacles the Brown environment presents to recording music — specifically, the severe paucity of practice spaces.</p>
<p class="p6">“There’s a distinct lack of equipment here,” McKie said, noting the lack of access to rehearsal rooms with the necessary gear, which are mostly restricted to Music and Modern Culture &amp; Media concentrators. “There’s like one room in TF Green to practice in,” he added. “That room is booked all day. While there are more bands being formed everyday, the availability of practice spaces isn’t increasing with that.”</p>
<p class="p6">“Logistics make things really complicated,” Back said.</p>
<p class="p6">But The Layovers also experience the effects of a more universal source of undergraduate angst, encountering difficulties in balancing thei<span class="s3">r band-related and academic commitments: “As a band, you need to be practicing constantly and booking regular shows,” McKie said. “But everyone has time pressures in school, which puts a damper on everything. It’s especially hard when the four of us are in different concentrations and our schedules conflict.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Back views writing music as a cathartic release from the stress inherent in Ivy League life: “I’ve always loved writing, and writing music is one of the only times I can write nowadays,” he said. “I try to distance myself from school when I write.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>The Euphonious “Bubble”</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">On campus, The Layovers have played at a number of popular venues and events, Back said, noting a couple acoustic sets played at the Hope College residential hall and The Underground. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“We’ve played at houses on-campus that aren’t technically campus buildings,” Back added, referencing house shows that include featured setlists at the Finlandia Co-Op. “Those have probably been our best shows. They get really rowdy but are still very intimate.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">But the band has yet to expand past the Van Wickle gates. “There’s not that strong of a connection between Brown and the Providence music scene,” McKie said. “We operate in totally different spheres,” Subiotto Marqués added. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">McKie offered a shrewd explanation of the disconnect between the two scenes: Brown’s location on the East Side’s tall and daunting College Hill ­— a situation that precludes easy transportation of bands’ equipment. “It’s got to be the geographic hill. Even if bands have the necessary gear, you still need to get all your gear down and back, as well as all the people.” </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“The people in the bands here are also just older,” Bellassai said. “College-aged kid bands are more prominent in big cities like Boston or New York. Providence just isn’t big enough.” </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Future layovers</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The travel-related layovers from which the group derives its name are tinged with tedium and stagnancy — words that do not describe the band itself. While The Layovers may be fairly established on the Brown music scene, the four artists, excited for the future, are always looking to improve their act. “Lately, we’re trying to develop more of a stage presence,” McKie said. “Anyone can be a band. But to actually physically be yourself and entertain people while doing it, that’</span>s the goal.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Raised in a lower-middle class family struggling with debt and haunted by a history of alcoholism, Seamus Kirst ’13 tells a story that began even before he was born in “Shitfaced: Musings of a Former Drunk.” The heart-wrenching but hopeful foreword, written by Kirst’s father, lays the groundwork for the developing memoir through his own story as a struggling writer and a self-described “blackout drinker.” From this foundation, Kirst composes a hilarious, blatantly honest and sometimes downright sad memoir, told from the vantage point of a Brown graduate and recovering alcoholic. While the story focuses on Kirst’s experience with alcoholism, he includes topics of class, sexuality and mental illness interlaced in the complicated saga.</p>
<p class="p1">The coming-of-age story begins fairly innocently, when, in Kirst’s early childhood, he would beg his mom to give him extra Flintstone vitamins. The story continues to follow Kirst on a complicated search for identity as he navigates a world of extremes. His battle with alcoholism culminates in his early twenties when he tries to manage a relationship in spite of his excess drinking. Following his breakup and another night he could not recall, he finally reached out to his father and began his recovery process.</p>
<p class="p1">Throughout the text, Kirst deals with an unconventional dichotomy in his character. “‘You have the most imbalanced personality of anyone I’ve ever met,’” he recalls his father saying. And though he was repeatedly hospitalized for alcohol poisoning and endured long stays in rehab, Kirst managed to maintain straight-As and made his way from a high school valedictorian in Syracuse, New York to a student at Brown, he recalls.</p>
<p class="p1">At times, the reader is jarringly reminded how grounded Kirst’s story is, literally, on College Hill. “One moment, I was on the Main Green of Brown’s Campus,” Kirst writes, adding that “it was 4/20 — the unofficial holiday of marijuana consumption — and everyone was smoking.” But, as the chapter unfolds, the reader realizes how the buzz of a well-known annual campus event easily obscures the darker experiences of its participants. One minute, Kirst is coming down off a high while he and his friends “talked about the Spring Weekend concert,” and the next he describes the impact of his drinking as he “fell deeper down the rabbit hole.”</p>
<p class="p1">He recalls calling his dad from the Main Green, reporting that he did not feel entirely comfortable at Brown. In his familial report, however, he did not mention the alcoholism that had impacted his life at school but instead talked about class disparities on campus.</p>
<p class="p1">“How could my dad, a normal person from lower middle-class America, comprehend kids running around with limitless credit cards?” he wrote. “I felt on the outside — left out;­ a feeling that I had been convinced would disappear when I got to the college of my dreams.”</p>
<p class="p1">Kirst pairs his personal anecdotes with the shared experiences of students across campuses and, for that matter, anyone who has ever felt like they were on the outside.</p>
<p class="p1">In the memoir, Kirst includes an essay he published called “There and Back Again: Why I Gave Up Alcohol at 22.” This condensed version of his story, which reached a global audience, inspired the larger text. “Alcoholism has taught me that you really can convince yourself to do anything,” Kirst writes, highlighting truths that transcend his specific experience. The essay ends on a hopeful, comical and confessional note, mimicked in the voice readers become familiar with in the memoir.</p>
<p class="p1">“But what I do have, finally, is the peace of mind knowing that I can wake up every morning remembering all that I did the night before — for better or for worse — and knowing, in the end, I will be okay.”</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article said that Seamus Kirst '13 was raised in a family living on the edge of bankruptcy. In fact, he was raised in a lower-middle class family struggling with debt. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In viewing the exhibition currently housed by the Sarah Doyle Women’s Center gallery, audiences have the opportunity not only to admire art, but also to take part in the artistic process itself. “This is a Life Worth Living,” a collection of pieces by Rhode Island-based artist and Brown alum Sarah Jane Lapp ’94, features 15 paintings and two jigsaw puzzles— the latter of which audiences are encouraged to assemble, disassemble and reassemble together.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The collection of paintings in the gallery span a variety of sizes, colors and styles. Some are visually complex, with layer upon layer of acrylic or gouache; others are more visually straightforward but equally as thematically nuanced — such as “Today’s Sliding Scale Price Menu,” a simple checklist written in ink. Two paintings, “Aquatica” and “Mumma’s Big Green Heart,” are accompanied by a puzzle version of the work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The exhibition’s namesake, “This is a Life Worth Living,” sits against the far wall of one of the gallery rooms. The large, vibrant painting was finished in 2013 and “launched my puzzle project,” Lapp said. “That painting was a big turning point in my practice as an artist.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While undergoing physical therapy and confined to relative inactivity in southeast Massachusetts, she decided to rent a puzzle from the local library. This puzzle not only helped Lapp eventually finish the painting, which, up until that point, had been an ongoing project, but also inspired her to begin making puzzles out of her work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The puzzle “really changed my life. I wasn’t really a jigsaw person as a kid, but this experience of slowly assembling something in an incremental fashion was very therapeutic,” Lapp said. “I noticed that (medical spaces) were often bereft of anything of beauty or interest, … and I thought it’d be really nice to have a creative, meditative activity in this context.’” Lapp added. This idea evolved into “the puzzle project.” Eleven of the artist’s works are now available in jigsaw form, and Lapp has helped initiate a number of projects in their wake. For example, Lapp now provides puzzles to the Miriam Hospital oncology unit for patients to put together when getting infusions. “For me, that’s a rewarding relationship — to find spaces where the puzzles expedite feeling and communal action,” Lapp said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lapp’s exhibition, which will be on display through Sept. 15, supplements a current shift in the curating process at the Sarah Doyle Women’s Center. In the past, a designated gallery board would make formal calls for art and choose which artist to feature from among the submissions. “What we found was happening was that a lot of the artists selected weren’t from around here,” said Felicia Salinas-Moniz MA’06 PhD ’13, who helped curate the exhibit. “(So) this year we’re trying something different.” Instead of issuing a call for submissions, gallery coordinators have been reaching out to artists from within the local community. “I really enjoyed seeing how folks come together and collectively try to put the art together. ... The act of creating the puzzle becomes also an art piece. It’s an idea that I think really works well in a university community,” Salinas-Moniz said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The curators also found Lapp’s puzzles to be<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an exploration of playfulness, fitting for the start of the school year. “One of the things I appreciate about (Lapp’s) work is that she’s delving into really difficult issues, but there’s a playfulness in puzzlemaking,” Salinas-Moniz said. “I think at the beginning of a … school year, having that playfulness and hope is a good way to start.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Menashe’ explores conflict between convention, individuality</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/05/menashe-explores-conflict-convention-individuality/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite the influx of students coming back to campus for the start of fall semester, not many went to check out “Menashe,” a movie currently showing at the Avon. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the surface, it’s not obvious what would attract a typical Brown student to Thayer Street theater’s most recent attraction, which focuses primarily on the difficulties that face a man who, frankly, just doesn’t get it — a movie that features women only in supporting roles and takes place in an isolated Hasidic community. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first scene takes viewers to New York City where, Menashe, a middle-aged Hasidic man, stands behind the counter at a supermarket. Here, the movie showcases one of its best features — the ability to capture the atmospheric quality of its setting. The sallow yellow light in the crowded store serves as a backdrop to a harried woman who complains to Menashe while he checks her out. Her baby is crying, she’s rushed and Menashe looks on without empathy. Understandably so, as his wife recently died and he is estranged from his son.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The movie uses Hasidic culture to reveal the complications of a society steeped in tradition that resents the bumbling missteps to which Menashe is consistently prone. Menashe, like a baby, cannot effectively cook, clean or even fulfill his duties at work in the absence of his late wife. Through various comical mishaps, the movie reinforces the idea that Menashe does not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>comply with any traditional qualification of responsible behavior.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In spite of this, he is stubbornly determined to raise his son independently from his wife’s brother. He essentially kidnaps his child from his brother-in-law’s more traditional home and takes him to live in his apartment where he feeds his son soda and cake for breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By the end of the film, after Menashe has repeatedly failed to adhere to even basic responsibilities and refused any form of help, the rabbi forgives him and suggests that he will be able to raise his son on his own. The pivotal next scene shows him emerging from a bath, and implicitly beginning to turn his life around. Here, the director suggests that somehow Menashe’s subversive behavior trumps the confines of tradition; that his determination somehow earns him guardianship of his son. And in some ways this might be true: Undoubtedly, the harsh separation from his son initially imposed by the rabbi warrants some empathy for Menashe.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By diving into a society that enforces challenging and seemingly inexplicable guidelines for how things should be done, Menashe’s experiences evoke relatable emotions. Many are inclined to question and reassess these systems, and Menashe does exactly this — except that in his efforts, he also drags along his child. And while the viewer empathizes with Menashe’s principled approach to follow his heart over tradition, the implication in the film of Menashe’s ability to change and ultimately care for his son, despite repeated failure, feels like an over-simplification.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Menashe” is, at its best, a movie about a stubborn old bachelor trying to raise a son. At it’s worst, it is a melodrama that follows an entitled man who just can’t get what he wants. It has its quirky moments: Menashe chatting about women in a supermarket basement, failing to raise a chicken in a New York City apartment or, simply, standing in a dark gas station eating his sandwich with an unamused cashier. And it has its cringey moments — his bluntness on a date or his pleas to his boss to loan him money. But, more than anything, the director has effectively raised important questions that viewers can carry out of the Avon:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When is it okay to comply with tradition? Can Menashe’s stubbornness and willpower surpass convention, even when it puts his son in an unsafe situation? Menashe’s neighbor says to him: “Even a bear can learn to dance,” and it’s up to the viewer to decide whether they’re convinced.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">“Look what happened when you were dreaming / And then punch yourself in the face.” So begins the eponymous song off “American Dream,” the much-anticipated reunion album by the electronic alternative rock outfit LCD Soundsystem. The lyric reads like a call for reflection in the wake of the six years that have eclipsed since LCD Soundsystem’s initial 2011 break-up — a disbandment defined by an accompanying farewell show at Madison Square Garden. For the alternative crowd, the group’s now-legendary concert, organized by LCD Soundsystem frontman James Murphy emulates The Beatles’ “Let It Be” 1970 rooftop performance in its import. Selling out instantly, the nearly four-hour-long set drew tens of thousands of Converse-clad fans and cemented the band’s synthy, stimulant-ridden sound into rock ‘n’ roll’s canon. <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></p>
<p class="p2">In retrospect, it’s hard not to see it all as a masterfully executed publicity stunt. In 2015, after delighting in the money and surge of popularity brought about by that “final” performance, the band promptly reunited. Murphy is clearly no stranger to this kind of deliberate brand-building. As anthologized in “Meet Me In The Bathroom” — Lizzy Goldman’s recently released oral history of the 2000s rock — Murphy had an illustrious career as lead producer for DFA Records before forming his own musical project in his thirties. That project, LCD Soundsystem, made waves early on with tracks like “Losing My Edge” and “Daft Punk Is Playing at My House.” These songs showcased Murphy’s supreme technicality and his characteristically ironic and referential bent. Yet, as Goodman’s book documents, this rapid success was not achieved without cunning and deceit. Through the evisceration of countless bands’ careers, Murphy established himself as a virtuosic veteran capable of making incredible music and navigating a cutthroat industry. For what it is worth, Murphy may very well be the alt-rock analogue to Kanye West in ego and artistry.</p>
<p class="p2">“American Dream” takes Murphy’s musical prowess and self-mythologizing to new heights. Technically the fourth album under the LCD Soundsystem name, the record might as well be a solo one, as the singer-songwriter-producer remains at the helm of almost all of the album’s instrumentation and production. Every track on the album revels in both explicit and implicit references. Perhaps egotistically, Murphy attempts to both emulate talents of and equate his musical chops with departed creative giants like David Bowie and Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p class="p2">The LP’s opening song “Oh Baby” echoes the sultry vocals and synths of the ’70s electronic group Suicide, while the lyrics to closing track “Black Screen” play out as a thinly-veiled ode to Bowie’s death. In the hands of basically anyone else, such a move would be setting the stakes unreasonably high. But Murphy capably approaches rock greats, transcending mere imitation for an incredible sound at once new and old.</p>
<p class="p2">LCD Soundsystem has always made alternative music that you could actually dance to, full of sharp drum fills and manic synth lines. But “American Dream” takes a decidedly more subdued turn, tending instead towards drawn-out soundscapes and layered textures. Both honoring and slandering the traditional social ideals encapsulated by the album’s title, Murphy avoids tossing barbs at easy targets like political figures and the media. Instead, Murphy looks inward, analyzing his own experiences both living out and failing to realize the American Dream.</p>
<p class="p2">On standout track “Tonite,” Murphy’s lyrics continue to grapple with his successes and shortcomings in scrutinizing his and others’ actions over the course of one sad night. In this respect, he triumphs over his contemporary Father John Misty, whose 2017 LP sunk under pretentious generalities. Taken alone, the straightforward lyrics could be read as terrible poetry. But from Murphy’s limited yet evocative register, the words more than compensate for their simplicity. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p2">There are no immediate hits to be found on “American Dream.”The somber and glacial record invites rumination rather than celebration, hitting listeners like a profound “punch to the face” after repeated, focused listening. On the LP, Murphy cements his status as one of alternative’s finest, shining through the static that obscures his personal and creative talents more than ever before.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Cable Car Cinema, a Providence film theater and coffee shop frequented by students seeking independent and international cinematic entertainment, has been a staple of the Providence indie scene for decades. But the films that the Cable Car shows range from film festival darlings to newly unearthed jewels. “Patti Cake$,” the breakthrough film of this year’s Sundance Film Festival, is one such film.</p>
<p class="p2">The movie features Patricia Dombrowski, a.k.a. Patti Cake$, a.k.a. Killer P, and her poignant quest for glory. Hers is a relentless struggle to break free from the daily realities of her downtrodden New Jersey hometown. She dreams of making it as a rap star, and her dreams uplift her, giving her a purpose, while also holding her back in a state of brewing restlessness throughout the film.</p>
<p class="p2">The film does not paint a pretty picture of her surroundings. Patti seems stuck on the wrong side of the Hudson River, overlooking the Manhattan skyline that feels as inaccessible as having throngs of fans shouting her name. Her ordinary hometown lends to Patti’s life an untenable flatness that is propitious for big dreams.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The film’s beauty is in the details: The way the camera catches the small things in Patti’s life make the story touching. The pace of the first half of the story is slow. The viewer is left squirming in her seat, feeling keen empathy for each of the characters who are hopping from one foot to another, ready to bolt into something bigger than the trapping monotony of their lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Accompanying the restlessness that the film conveys come other more subtle themes that deal with the continued rejection Patti faces. At 23, Patti, an obese white woman, does not ‘look’ the part of the aspiring rapper. Her close friend and collaborator Jheri, a happy-go-lucky try-hard of Indian origin, also does not fit in with the aspiring rap crowd of their hometown. The viewer fears for Patti that the world she longs for seems barred to her by virtue of who she is and what she looks like. The rap world’s rejection of Patti, combined with her mother’s projection of her own failures, push Patti even further from her dreams.</p>
<p class="p2">The movie draws an uncomfortable parallel between Patti’s life and her mother’s. Her mother, Barb, was also once an inspiring artist. She was held back by an unwanted pregnancy and reduced to reliving her glory days at the local bar’s karaoke machine. Patti is often at odds with Barb, alternating between disgust and truly tender moments. Her consistent fear of ending up in her mother’s shoes weaves into the multitude of tensions, fears and dreams that make up the general restless mood of the film.</p>
<p class="p2">For a solid hour or so, Patti meanders down a path toward an impossible dream. She finally finds her place among others who don’t ‘look the part.’ This includes the elusive figure of Tyrone, a black antichrist with clothes and a fake blue eye a la Marilyn Manson; Jheri, who endeavors to release the group’s E.P. at the local strip club; and her beloved grandmother, Nan, who suffers from a pill addiction and can only move in a wheelchair.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Patti’s life gains traction as she works two jobs and begins to record with her new group. Her mother’s dismissal of her music slides off her shoulders, and Patti begins working for something in earnest, leaving the viewer with an ominous feeling that the pieces of her life are being set up only to be shot down.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Though the film does not escape the trope of a main character who is dealt a seemingly insurmountable blow only to gain overarching success, “Patti Cake$” gives its characters a happy ending befitting of the tender nature of the film. The real victory is not found in the success of a final rap battle. The truly magical moment comes as the film ties together the entire plot in an emotional moment that honors Patti’s talent, her dreams, her mother’s dreams and the downtrodden landscape in New Jersey that fostered it all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Stranger Than Paradise’ explores art through history</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Upon initial regard, the contemporary art exhibition, “Stranger than Paradise,” appears as a baffling mixture of contemporary and ancient art. With works from the Rhode Island School of Design alums, professors and more, this collection of 14 items from the RISD Museum’s permanent holdings opened last July and explores the relationship between humans and nature over time. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Assembled by Dominic Molon, the Richard Brown Baker curator of contemporary art at the RISD Museum, the show features an eclectic<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>selection of pieces that range from a Greek wine jug dating back to 610 BCE to works by recent RISD graduates like Sophia Narrett.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The collection “developed from, as often collection presentations do, objects that I’d been wanting to have on view in the galleries for some time,” Molon said. When a space opened up for the exhibition, he and John Smith, director of the museum, discussed a presentation that had themes of nature. “He suggested kind of looking back into history and combining more contemporary works with works from different historical periods,” Molon added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Within the exhibit, one of the most noticeable objects is a work by Michael Smith, a sculptor who lives in Providence. It features a “pigeon form encased in a resin within the structure that is taken from a door found here in Providence, but cut very deeply to resemble a landscape or a seascape,” Molon said. It is simultaneously surreal and disquieting, and presents a much more “abstracted idea of humankind and nature,” Molon added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast, a painting by Wilhelm Frederik van Royen entitled “The Young Hunter” dates back to 1706 and features an image of a young man surrounded by the bounty of his hunt. The contrast between the pieces in the collection that are traditionally pastoral and familiar against pieces like Smith’s creates a tension between the works akin to the tension between humankind and nature. This is a central theme that the exhibition seeks to explore.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “Something that was very important for me when I got here, is to be very proactive about getting the work of recent RISD alumni into the collection. … I think we’ve missed the boat in the past on artists who do come out of RISD who make a huge impact in the art world and don’t have a very major work of theirs up in the collection,” Molon said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Sophia Narrett, with her stitch-based sculpture, and Tomory Dodge, with his painting of a deconstructed tree post-storm, constitute the two RISD alum pieces in the collection. Angela Dufresne, a professor at RISD, is also featured in the collection with her painting “Man and Kid” that shows a young man, caked in blood, emerging from the woods with a goat thrown over his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Narrett’s work coupled well with the work of another artist, Wifredo Lam. “I had those works, in mind, together. Sophia’s was an incredibly labor-intensive stitch piece that takes all these highly eroticized and sexualized unions and congregations of people in this very verdant tropical setting,” Molon said. “Wifredo Lam has also this sensual sort of nature to it but the figures are much more abstracted and eroticized.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “One of the tensions in our work is that sometimes it’s hard to gauge what public perception is going to be of the show,” said Matthew Berry, a marketing specialist who worked on promoting the exhibition. “We work to find ways in which our exhibitions and our collection can be made relatable to people, how they speak to current events,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Visitors have expressed a little confusion about the show, so I refer them to what is written about it, but it is a bit of an eclectic mix,” said Bob Pratae, a security staff member who has worked at the RISD Museum for 18 years. “I found it a bit of an odd mixture of work but I understand where the curator is coming from with looking at how art has been interpreted.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New exhibition portrays female immigrant identity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">Spools of thread sprawled about a table and an imposing metal detector suggestive of xenophobic persecution loom at the Periphery Space gallery in Pawtucket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The exhibition, entitled “Crossing Borders,” speaks to the duality of the identities and perspectives of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>21st-century female migrants journeying to the United States. The installation opened Sept. 9 and will be on display at Periphery Space until Oct. 14.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jocelyn Foye, a multimedia artist and decorated activist, and Judith Tolnick Champa, an arts critic and founder of the Providence Biennial for Contemporary Art, curated the exhibit. Paying close attention to the rise of immigrant-centric art in the wake of the election of President Donald Trump, the curators aimed to collate works that extend this brand of activism to the experiences of mostly female immigrant artists. The female creatives include Venezuelan-American Esperanza Mayobre and Iranian-American Saman Sajasi. Their works are accompanied by those of male artists such as Mexican-American Camilo Cruz. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The decision to root “Crossing Borders” in feminine perspectives stems partially from Foye’s illustrious involvement with the feminist movement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I started a group called the Women’s Project that engages in a lot of performance art action, sort of like the Guerilla Girls,” Foye said, likening her organization’s purpose to that of the acclaimed collective of anonymous feminist artists. “It all traces heavily to the philosophy of the exhibit.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sajasi’s “Glory,” is a highlight of the exhibit, featuring a silk-woven mandala interlaid with digital Google Maps-like webbing. The scope of the eight-by-eight foot piece and its juxtaposition of the traditional and modern encapsulate the realities of immigrant women’s labor-intensive lives and the globalization that both drives and drains them. Sajasi is set to speak at the exhibit Oct. 5 along with RISD faculty member Maya Krinsky. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An essay by rising Iranian-American artist Ariana Gharib Lee ’15 features in the exhibition’s illustrated brochure. The piece addresses the dichotomy between the cold observation of art in exhibits and a viewer’s personal relation to it — the former of which, Lee argues, persists heavily and problematically in identity-centric art such as those in “Crossing Borders.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think there is an extra personal and emotional leg you can take that’s very easy to not do in a museum,” Lee said. “Seeing something that’s very decontextualized from its maker and its environment requires a responsibility that involves seeing how you’re implicated in the oppression an artist is pointing to.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It is cool to be engaged with art and politics at the same time,” Tolnick Champa said, alluding to the politically-charged nature that all the works on display share. The exhibit “is so subtle and not rhetorically in-your-face.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The seamless subtlety achieved by “Crossing Borders” might best be epitomized by the exhibit’s own migrations. The collection is slated to move from Pawtucket’s Periphery Space to Brown’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs and John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage Oct. 27. In its transience, the exhibit performatively emulates the migratory themes of its works. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are sort of forcing people to practice the migratory processes the exhibit details by literally forcing people to migrate between the two to see all of the art,” Foye said. “We are also really excited that two institutions that are not centered around art are taking on the exhibit,” Foye added. “It is really addressing what the exhibit is about by way of where it’s going.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“An academic setting and structure are going to be really wonderful,” Champa said. In contrast with the more creatively oriented communities involved with Periphery Space, “Brown is going to provide a sort of foil.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The installation will remain at the Watson Institute and John Nicholas Brown Center through January, after which it will relocate to other locations around Rhode Island in a continuation of its elegant and enlightening nomadism.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article misstated that Saman Sajasi is set to speak at the exhibit on Oct. 4. In fact, Sasaji is set to speak at the exhibit Oct. 5. In addition, the article has been updated to reflect the fact that RISD faculty member Maya Krinsky will also be speaking at the exhibit. </strong></em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As artists continue to grapple with issues of race and identity, the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America opened the 2017-18 academic year with the exhibit “The Body As Site Of,” which displays the artwork of four contemporary artists of color — Akujixxv, Devyn Galindo, Panteha Abareshi and Carolina Hicks.</p>
<p class="p2">The curator of the exhibition, Brigitte Santana, a public humanities master’s student at the University, talked about the lack of diversity in the art world at the exhibit’s opening Wednesday evening. Museum collections and exhibitions often reflect the priorities of mainstream institutions, and artwork is selected by people who do not reflect the demographics of their society, she said.</p>
<p class="p2">This exhibit aims to highlight artwork by people of color and convey a variety of experiences, Santana said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is important for artists to see themselves represented in museums, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">“What is it like to be a Latinx confronting political issues in Los Angeles? What is it like to simultaneously fight against sickle cell zero beta thalassemia and oppressive ideas of intimacy and gender? What is it like to address the issues of emotional and mental wellbeing as a Colombian American in the west coast or as a Jamaican American in the east coast?” Santana asked, referring to the different experiences of the displayed artists.</p>
<p class="p2">One of the attendees of the event, Samuel Ortiz, a staff member at the Office of Residential Life, said that he came to support art work by people of color. The artwork is “beautiful, inspiring, thought provoking,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Manager of the Programs and Outreach at the Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice Maiyah Gamble Rivers<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>said that she was moved by the purity of the artwork, which reminds her of an intimate diary or sketchbook.</p>
<p class="p2">“Despite the disparity in our institutions at large, this exhibition reminds us some of the promises of art, including being able to connect with experiences unlike our own,” Santana said.</p>
<p class="p2">Tricia Rose AM’87 PhD’93 P’14, associate dean of the faculty for special initiatives, professor of Africana studies and director of CSREA, thanked everyone for attending the event because the center “is not a private think tank. It is a campus and public resource to build … community on race and ethnicity.”</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last Wednesday, several Brown and Rhode Island School of Design students travelled to New York to walk the runways at New York Fashion Week, modeling designs by 13 RISD graduates from the class of 2017, who had presented these designs as their culminating thesis projects in May.</p>
<p class="p2">The 13 graduates were selected from a pool of senior apparel majors by a panel that included department members and a number of guest critics, such as Kate Wallace, a design director at Club Monaco.</p>
<p class="p2">Many of the models were new to the world of runway walking. “The first time I ever modeled was last year when (Designer Coleen Chan) texted me like, ‘Are you interested?’” said Valerie Zhu ’17, a model for Chan’s collection.</p>
<p class="p2">Chan’s new collection was inspired by her mother’s journey from communist China. “The pieces that were (presented) earlier on were more structured and rigid. … As the collection progressed, by the end, it was more free-form … more organic looking,” Zhu said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She used techniques on the clothes that were only available back in that time, so there were no zippers on anything. It’s all based on buttons and clasps.”</p>
<p class="p2">Showing designs at New York Fashion Week was “the best opportunity I could ask for,” said Taylor Goldenberg, another RISD graduate who presented her collection, Pink Champagne, in New York. Goldenberg named her collection Pink Champagne “because it’s a celebration and introspection of feminine dress,” as well as an exploration “between nostalgic and contemporary femininity,” she added. Pink Champagne explored notions of “femininity from the past and femininity in present day … and kind of (blended) the two to figure out my identity in the scope of feminine dress.”</p>
<p class="p2">Goldenberg said she derives inspiration from everyday objects and forms, basing her silhouettes off of the human body, such as using “the folds of skin to make folds in the fabric.” Her designs were hand-made over a period of two semesters, spending approximately three weeks per garment for a total of nine pieces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She described the collection as “a princess dress-up but for an adult woman.”</p>
<p class="p2">Maya Menefee ’18, a model in Goldenberg’s collection, described Goldenberg’s design as a mixture of streetwear and “otherworldly” art. “I was wearing a mix of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>…<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this poofy black top and this sheer dress that was semi-transparent and then underwear underneath,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">Menefee estimated the venue was big enough to fit 600 people, with an audience consisting of a number of influential figures in the fashion world, including designer Zac Posen and model Coco Rocha.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Reuse, Reconsidered,” a three-day conference organized by the department of History of Art and Architecture, took place this weekend in the Granoff Center for Performing Arts. The conference set out to explore the idea of recycling physical artifacts, spaces and aesthetic trends in human history. Lecturers came from different academic institutions across the country and the world to share work that exemplified this theme. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The program began Friday with opening remarks entitled “The Alchemy of Moments: 150 years of reuse in Delhi, India,” by Mrinalini Rajagopalan, associate professor of history of art and architecture at the University of Pittsburgh. The conference was organized into 11 panels each exploring different sub-themes. Saturday lectures included topics ranging from “Appropriation and Power” to “Reconstructed Meaning.” The next day, the panels went on to address themes of “Continuities and Discontinuities,” “Politicizing Reuse” and “Fragmentation and Reassembly.” The conference also included a tour of campus, addressing examples of reuse in university spaces.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s always amazing when you pick up on … vast, grand similarities in extremely different time periods,” said attendee Josie Johnson, Ph.D. Each panel, which ran one hour and 40 minutes, included a series of short lectures on specific topics in the field of history of art and architecture related to the panel’s theme and the overarching concept of reuse. Lecturers covered topics ranging from the Denver Medical Center to Scandinavian Architecture to Medieval Architecture in America. The discussions, even within each of the eleven panels, featured diverse areas of study. For example, Johnson’s lecture, entitled “Refuse to Reuse: Photographs of St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow, ca. 1930,” was accompanied with lectures that focused on various themes, such as Salvador Dali, coffin reuse and architecture, in the Dominican Republic. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“‘Thy Neck is like the Tower of David’: The Jerusalem Citadel and the Cult of King David in British Mandate Palestine,” hosted by Michal Goldschmidt PhD, discussed the use of the historical tower as an exhibition space by the British, she said. The conference as a whole gave her a chance to take in information about different time periods, researched by a diverse group of art historians, that encountered the same issues, Goldschmidt said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">H.C. Arnold, associate faculty of humanity at Riverside City College, made a similar observation. “What I have been … most impressed with is the breadth of scholarship here,” he said. His lecture on “Brazil’s Graffiti Community” was followed a presentation by a Princeton professor working with nineteenth-century Japanese art. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Following each panel, the lecturers spoke to the audience more specifically about their work and the concept of reuse. Many onlookers had pertinent questions about the lecturers’ research. But the conversations following the lectures extended beyond questions about presented material and began to assess the vocabulary of “re-appropriating” versus of “reimagining.” By closing reception on Sunday evening, more than forty speakers had had the opportunity to share their research. Each speaker left with insight into the overarching commonalities across their collective fields, as well as a reusable name tag that, if planted, will grow into wildflowers.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hats off: Brown Derbies drop new album, “Unaccounted For”</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Sept. 15 marked a special day for the Brown Derbies: the release of their latest album, “Unaccounted For.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The 13th album released by the a cappella group, “Unaccounted For,” features a variety of contemporary music, all drawn directly from the Derbies’ repertoire. Tracks range from pervasive pop hits like Sia and Jessie Shatkin’s “Chandelier” to the soulful rock of Alabama Shakes’ “Don’t Wanna Fight.” The Derbies harmonize flawlessly throughout each number, building off the central melody and taking advantage of the flexible nature of a cappella. There’s no shortage of swelling crescendos, shining solos and weighty moments of silence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The album is a product of three years’ work, consisting of tracks recorded from 2014-2017 and featuring the voices of Derbies from six years’ worth of graduating classes. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With their iconic hats and vests, the a cappella group has been a presence on the University’s campus since the ’80s, with their first album released in 1986. Their most recent performance, “Smoked Salomon,” a joint event with the Chattertocks a cappella group, took place in Salomon Hall last Friday, the same day “Unaccounted For” was released. The Derbies “had a very engaging stage presence, as well as amazing vocals,” said Estefany Delgadillo ’20, who attended the performance. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Derbies have also been a presence on other college campuses, going on tour every year to national and international venues. Last year, they visited U.S. cities like New Orleans and Austin, Texas; the year before, they toured in China. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There have been a couple occasions on tour when we’ll lose someone in a foreign city, and that’s kind of where the term ‘Unaccounted For’ came from,” said Oliver Hu ’18, the Derbies’ music director. “We always find them — don’t worry!.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All of the music in the album is arranged by members of the Derbies themselves. “A lot of beginning arrangers listen to the song and essentially just make a carbon-copy of the song for voice,” Hu said. “And it works — you make this faithful recreation of a song …(but) voices have unique qualities and abilities that instruments don’t have, and vice versa, so I think it’s very important to adapt a song so that you take advantage of the fact it’s a group of singers.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Musically, “Unaccounted For” is “pushing the envelope,” said Iladro Sauls ’19, co-business manager of the Derbies. “We really tried to branch out in terms of bringing some unique stylistic twists to the songs.” He noted the album’s use of silence as one such twist, remarking on the way the Derbies would “really (strip) things down to dynamics, sometimes just the beat and the solo… down to the main essential parts, and then (use) swells and stuff to bring everyone back in.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The album is already on streaming services including Spotify and iTunes, and hard copies of the CD will also be for sale at future Derby performances. “It sounds a little bare bones, but we just try to make music that people enjoy listening to,” Sauls said. “The goal in going into it (isn’t that) we want to make good a cappella music — we just want to make good music.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Friday, students and faculty from the University and the Rhode Island School of Design gathered in the List Art Center’s David Winton Bell Gallery for the opening reception of Richard Fishman’s exhibition, “What Remains.” Fishman, who has crafted inventively disruptive pieces since the ’60s, is renowned for his interdisciplinary works that juxtapose natural and synthetic materials to create striking sculpture installations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A recipient of both the Guggenheim and Howard fellowships, Fishman has been a member of Brown’s Department of Visual Art since 1965. He has also designed creativity workshops and served as the Director of the Creative Arts Council for the University.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fishman “has been a crucial part of the art (community) here at Brown for decades,” said Ian Russell, director of the Bell Gallery. “We’re hoping that the community will find it inspirational or enlightening to see types of artistic work that a leader such as himself can make.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For two hours, gallery-goers slowly meandered through the exhibition’s three rooms, all of which featured works that merited praise as stand-alones but collectively proved more meaningful. The walls showcased several “Untitled” pieces where carbon fragments were made to resemble wispy, wind-torn locks of black hair scattered about a creme canvas. “What Remains,” the gigantic, steely centerpiece and principle sculpture from which the exhibition derived its name, stands at least seven feet tall and is primarily constructed of carbon fiber fabric. In another room, two tree-like sculptures stood side by side. One was made of elm wood and the other of carbon composite, a synthetic material most commonly used in military aircraft that first appeared in Fishman’s work in 2009.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Russell noted that Fishman’s current work with carbon composite makes viewers consider their relationship to the organic and the synthetic: “the contrast of wind-battered sails and sleek, techno-futuristic (materials) communicates a sense of meditative urgency,” Russell said, adding that he suspected there was a social commentary element to Fishman’s work. “It’s hard not to think of ‘Black Mirror’.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Alternatively, Modern Culture and Media professor and filmmaker Michael Udris was moved by the “rawness” of Fishman’s work, “particularly with these large slabs,” he said, pointing to the twin tree sculptures. “It’s bewildering to look at.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Artist Brien Weiz,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>said that Fishman enjoys referring to the installation as a “cast of characters.” Russell was also impressed by the variations in color: “It’s moving to see such a spectrum of color within blacks. … It shows that there’s a tremendous range of possibilities and feelings in our difficult emotions. That difficult, fraught place can be profound.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">About Fishman’s work, Weiz said, “I feel like (Fishman) is never not experimenting. ... He’s always exploring something new. There’s a lot of depth to the process.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Aronofsky’s “Mother!” mixes allegory with chaos</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is “Mother!”? An environmental allegory? A perverse retelling of the creation myth? A cautionary tale about dating a film director? A home improvement thriller?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Mother!,” the new film from director Darren Aronofsky, is all of these things. Maybe. There has to be a point, one figures, where multivalence crosses over into incoherence. And the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>further along this film goes on its tense acid trip of a narrative, the more it seems to cross that line.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The film begins with the character credited only as “Him,” played by Javier Bardem, placing a jewel in an austere steel nest, which refreshes his decrepit and burned house. Ashes and debris disappear, colors reemerge and the house becomes an idyllic island in a sea of tall grasses. A paradise, if you will. But the most important restoration happens in the bedroom, where the form of a sleeping woman materializes, rising like a soufflé beneath the bedsheets. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The woman is “Mother,” played by Jennifer Lawrence, and she has a good deal of baking, cooking, cleaning, doting and fretting ahead of her. Married to a poet, she is a devoted wife, content to work on the house, still unfinished, while her husband cloisters himself away in his office. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But from the first moment we see the two of them together, an unease sets in. Bardem enters with a jump scare, and Aronofsky shoots Lawrence in a tight close-up, crowding the audience with her pleading, anxious face. She doesn’t just love her husband; she reveres him. Yet the thrill of having a beautiful young woman around to praise and support him has begun to wear off. When she tells him that she loves his work, he brushes her off with a weary “I know you do.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Soon enough, the couple has visitors. First comes “Man,” played by Ed Harris, a doctor who claims to have mistaken the house for a bed and breakfast. When Him invites Man to stay the night, Mother reacts with confusion and distress — why is her husband inviting this strange man into their private paradise? The next day, when Man’s wife — “Woman,” played by Michelle Pfeiffer — arrives, Mother becomes even more distraught. Who are these people, and why are they here? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lawrence, Bardem, Harris and Pfeiffer form the heavyweight core of actors here, and the film is at its best when focused on them. The tensions within and between the couples make for discomfiting marital drama. When Harris and Pfeiffer lustily lock lips in front of Bardem and Lawrence, Bardem watches with a strange, quiet excitement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The very best scenes, though, are those that spotlight Lawrence and Pfeiffer. Woman peppers Mother with questions about her home and sex life, musing that Mother and her husband ought to have children, since then they’d be “creating something together.” Pfeiffer, slightly drunk off spiked lemonade, dispenses withering glances and condescending put-downs with shattering, hilarious precision. For a few minutes, she transforms “Mother!” into something like a Nancy Meyers production shot with the nervy psychosis of Roman Polanski. Pfeiffer’s performance is the one out-and-out triumph of the film.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As “Mother!” progresses, it becomes larger and weirder in scope. More visitors arrive, blood is spilled, an apocalypse is nigh and a woman gives birth. Yet the chaos feels too broad to ever become as disquieting as Aronofsky wants it to be, and the allegories become at once confused and obvious — in a few choice moments, he conveys themes with all the subtlety of a crowning baby.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Throughout all of this, Lawrence carries out the unenviable task of repeatedly screaming things like, “No, it’s not yours!,” “What are you doing?” and “You need to leave!” She’s not bad, but she doesn’t quite transcend the limits of the role, either.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What exactly those limits are, and why they are there, is difficult to pin down, and only complicated by the fact that Lawrence and Aronofsky are currently in a relationship. One of the film’s themes is the idea of the muse as victim, subject to the moods and tempers of the artist. It’s hard not to wonder: is Aronofsky trying to tell Lawrence something here?</span></p>
<p class="p2">Whatever their relationship may bring to bear on the film, the fact remains that the trope of the inscrutable male artist is growing old. “Mother!” seemed as though it might take it on from a new angle, focused as it is on the woman, narratively and visually. Aronofsky claims that 66 minutes of the film are a close-up of Lawrence’s face, which seems right. When the close-ups aren’t on screen, the camera rotates around Lawrence, showing everything in relation to her. For all but a few frames, Lawrence is the center of gravity.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even so, Mother never comes into her own. She is God, Mary, womanhood, nature and muse. Subject to and abused by the film’s thematic agenda, she is everything but a real character. Stories of victimhood are only as interesting as their victims, and Aronofsky has neglected his. This isn’t to say, however, that Aronofsky has a complete failure on his hands. “Mother!” is polarizing and personal, and the fact that it received a wide release is as puzzling as it is welcome — lunatic cinematic craft is in short supply at the multiplex these days. It deserves to be rewarded.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">“The Trip to Spain” runs exactly like one would expect from the third installment of a comedic culinary travelogue — a cheeky but tired retread that cheapens the artistic and gastronomic richness of the series’ first two chapters.</p>
<p class="p4">Following the format established by their 2010 film “The Trip” and their 2014 sequel, “The Trip to Italy,” comedians Steven Coogan and Rob Brydon next turned their attention toward the Spanish coast, playing lightly fictionalized versions of themselves as they riff impressions over a series of meals sampling the local cuisine. There’s the semblance of a plot — Coogan and Brydon are in Spain to write food reviews for separate print publications, and both grapple with the occasional jaded familial and career drama — but it largely serves as narrative fluff to allow for the dining comedy that provides the film’s backbone.</p>
<p class="p4">Ultimately, “The Trip to Spain” suffers from an identity crisis. The film feels stuck somewhere between an irreverent and plotless food feature that defies genre conventions and a more thoughtful story concerned with the kind of existential questions usually reserved for more serious “road trip” movies.</p>
<p class="p4">In Coogan and Brydon’s capable hands, “The Trip to Spain” teases viewers with occasional flashes of a tighter and established genre film. Certainly, the “Trip” series is a triumph of the comedians’ collective atmospheric vernacular, which is at turns both academic and improvisational. The pair are most famous for their celebrity impressions, in particular their hilarious Michael Caine parody, and make sure to include an abundance of these sketches throughout the movie. The film’s appeal peaks in the moments when Coogan and Brydon’s characters flit between dinner conversation and impersonations seamlessly, lending an ad-libbed authenticity to the scenes. One brief episode involving impressions of Marlon Brando and Woody Allen against the backdrop of the Spanish Inquisition proves delightful. Brydon especially dazzles, conferring his humor with a learned wit and impishness he has honed over the years as a veteran of the British late-night quiz show circuit.</p>
<p class="p4">Too frequently, however, the film falls back on old jokes from its prior two installments. The Michael Caine impression has been wrung of all its comedic potential, but the pair devotes several scenes to replaying that tired masquerade. You would expect a fresher effort from Coogan, Brydon and veteran director Michael Winterbottom ­— or at the very least an attempt to take the series in a different direction creatively.</p>
<p class="p4">The germ of that creative idea can be found in the film’s more somber and plot-driven nature. Coogan, in particular, endures several crises that could have been mined for more serious character development. The story lightly dances around its thematic undertones, and the several references made to Miguel de Cervantes offered a ripe opportunity for the film and its subjects to assume the kind of self-awareness that is largely put on the back burner in favor of comedy.</p>
<p class="p4">Perhaps Coogan and Brydon should take a cue from “Travel Man,” the British Channel 4 comedy starring Richard Ayoade, who, like Brydon, is a fellow veteran of the quiz show circuit. The show pairs Ayoade with another comedian and follows their exploits over the course of 48 hours, with each new episode featuring adventures in a different major city. “Travel Man” largely eschews plot or thematic intent, instead allowing Ayoade’s carefully crafted absurdity to spin its own creative web. Unlike “Travel Man,” “The Trip to Spain” often doesn’t know what it wants to be, which ultimately ruins the moments when it does.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">During last Friday night’s sold-out performance, prolific singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Phil Elverum submerged a Columbus Theatre audience under an entrancing and heart-wrenching set of stripped-back sonics. The aging hipsters and stick-and-poke-wearing Rhode Island School Design undergraduates who filled the seats were all wholly unprepared for the night’s devastation. Playing under the Mount Eerie monicker, Elverum collated the majority of the set from his latest collection of songs, “A Crow Looked at Me.” One of the year’s most critically-acclaimed releases, the record laments the July 2016 passing of Geneviève Castrée, Elverum’s wife and fellow singer-songwriter, from terminal pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p class="p2">Understandably, “A Crow Looked at Me” and its accompanying tour could not possibly be divorced from the death narrative surrounding the album. Elverum recorded the LP in his dead wife’s room and uses her guitar, bass and amplifier to exhort his anguish. Castrée inhabits every note of the album. Her spirit haunts every sparse guitar interval and cloaks each of Elverum’s defeated lyrical inscriptions. The album is a multisensory experience — it should not only be heard, but profoundly felt. It is a slow-burning, agonizingly cathartic punch, laden with idiosyncratically devastating documents of Elverum and his young daughter’s increasingly hollow existences.</p>
<p class="p2">The necessarily personal nature of the record calls into question why Elverum would choose to tour behind it and play his elegies for an audience that, inherently, could never relate the way he can. What if these pained evocations wrenched directly from the pits of his shriveling heart fall on unsympathetic ears? Such is the principal problem facing the confessional singer-songwriter ­— a dilemma Elverum is more than aware of.</p>
<p class="p2">“Death is real / … and it’s not for singing about,” begins “Real Death,” the opening track of both “A Crow Looked at Me” and Friday night’s set. The lyric interrogates the effectuality of art as mourning, but the song ultimately moves from hints of creative and philosophical probing to intensely sad descriptions of the empty daily life Elverum has taken on since his wife’s passing. Right away, it is evident that Elverum is not writing to elicit empathy; he is singing because he physically has to. The music he plays serves as a sort of coping mechanism, one that hinges on songwriting’s dual capacities for temporary liberation from trauma and for a way of obsessively sorting out trauma’s individual parts. Between songs, he vacantly stares into the distance and sighs weakly into the microphone, disrupting his plaintive set only to wipe away sweat and what must surely be tears from his face. For all he cares, he could be singing into a void.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By the end of “Real Death,” Elverum has unequivocally seized the attention of a crowd which, by this point, can only help but to watch with pious intensity. Nobody even has the audacity to interrupt the set with photographs. He launches into other tracks from his 2017 magnum opus, perhaps most notably “Soria Moria,“ which interpolates elements of “The Moon,” a Microphones song that’s inarguably one of the sublime high points of Elverum’s discography. The highlight capably reinterprets the lyrics and melodies of “The Moon” in light of Castrée’s death. Guitar strumming accompanies Elverum’s characteristically gentle cadences, every aspect coupling the gravity of his wife’s death with imagery cradled from sublime Norweigian landscapes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elverum followed up songs off of “A Crow Looked at Me” with entirely new material. The tracks he debuted similarly mourned Castrée, including “Tintin In Tibet,” which directly addresses her and self-consciously alludes to the fact he released an album written entirely about her death. This tendency of Elverum to continue grieving by way of his music further evidences songwriting’s potential as a generative mode of mourning.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Though the show could not have possibly lasted more than an hour and a half, time ostensibly suspended itself as Elverum compressed an entire lifetime’s worth of memories into the set.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b>Upon stepping onto the fifth floor of the Rhode Island School of Design Museum a year ago, viewers were transported 200 years back to Victorian-era salons. In the main gallery, which focuses on history paintings, artworks originally hung one on top of the other in an overwhelming display notable primarily for its sheer quantity. New fire safety codes in the aftermath of the Station nightclub fire in 2003 meant that the museum had to rework its galleries. Floor by floor, the museum has not only been working to meet codes, but also to very intentionally reinvigorate its spaces.</p>
<p class="p4">The main gallery on the fifth floor still contains the overwhelming portraits, excessive scenes of feasts and massive representations of religious imagery expected of a salon format. But now each work has an accompanying back story, said Maureen O’Brien, curator of painting and sculpture. The pieces lining the wall at eye level give viewers an opportunity to step closer to the art. With fewer works, observers can engage with each painting. For a moment, the observer can stand before “The Angel of Fame” painted by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo ca. 1750, which once guarded the palazzo of a newly rich family in Italy. Across from the “Angel,” “Thomas Estcourt, Esq.,” painted by Pompeo Girolamo Batoni on Estcourt’s Grand Tour, sits in the richest fashions of 1772, displaying in his portrait his determinacy to present himself as singularly well-read and cultured. Across the room, “Portrait of Antoine-Georges-Francois de Chabaud-Latour and His Family” painted by Jacques-Luc Barbier-Walbonne in 1806 shows a father telling his young daughter about her grandfather’s legacy. The opportunity to become immersed in works like these offers insight into the universal tendencies around image. The subjects, interested in displaying their success, have left a very self-conscious snapshot of their lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p4">In the next room, the viewers move away from traditional portraiture. In the 19th century, Paris salons began to give awards to paintings of landscapes. During this time, artists focused more on exhibiting the natural world. The way history was represented changed, O’Brien said. The ruins of monuments strewn across Roman landscapes as in “The Colosseum,” by Giovanni Paolo Pannini, or the hint of people dancing in the countryside as in “Tivoli,” by Jean-Victor Bertin, became the new access point for displaying the human story. In 1830, artists took landscape even further, choosing instead to portray completely untouched sceneries. “The purpose of landscape in art is for you to engage, emotionally, spiritually, intellectually with nature,” O’Brien said.</p>
<p class="p4">As the viewer continues through the exhibit, they encounter a gallery titled Painting Modern Life. In this room, paintings display both humans and landscapes, but the style has shifted entirely. As the Impressionist movement gained momentum and the works from the Salon des Refusés grew in cultural significance, artists began to experiment with the emotive quality of their style and subjects. In “The Basin at Argenteuil,” Monet recreated a landscape in an effort to capture its essence. The portraiture in this room does not express the same formality of the works in the main gallery. Manet’s painting, “Repose,” of Berthe Morisot depicts his subject resting comfortably on a sofa.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s ground-breaking,” O’Brien said.</p>
<p class="p4">Coming out of the proceeding gallery, the viewer can physically experience the evolution of European art in the late 19th century. They encounter a space incorporating striking works by van Gogh, Berthe Morisot and Paul Cézanne, guiding their experience to the advance of modern art.</p>
<p class="p4">The Jean di Bona Gallery contains paintings that stray from the representational aspects of the works on the rest of the floor. “I pinch myself every day,” O’Brien said, referencing the collection which features the key players in the development of modern art. The room contains works by Matisse, Picasso and Braques, which, gathered in a single space, carry viewers through the 20th century.</p>
<p class="p4">The Creamer Medieval Gallery, which represents a sharp juxtaposition from the more modern spaces, imitates the setup of a church, displaying religious objects in an attempt to echo the way the pieces might have been used. A chasuble worn by clergy in the 1300s, a pyx from the 1200s and even a Romanesque portal give visitors an opportunity to engage with the objects in a way that feels relevant to their personal experience, O’Brien said.</p>
<p class="p4">Upon exiting the space devoted to religious art, the viewer enters the Creamer Early Renaissance Gallery, which reveals the more domestic side of historic art items. The gallery no longer contains walls dividing the room, creating a spacious corridor and contributing to an experience that breaks down the concerted themes of the previous galleries.</p>
<p class="p4">Though the floor focuses on European art, this section expands these borders, featuring work from different regions, said Brian Pletcher, a security officer on the fifth floor. Works include a plate encouraging fertility featuring the birth of Mary, decorative bowls and a Turkish cushion cover. Though the gallery lacks any particular timeline, the space highlights Venice as a port central to trade and the exchange of ideas.</p>
<p class="p4">The last gallery, a collection of portraits, returns to the idea of how subjects hoped to be portrayed after their deaths. Here, statues and paintings showcase ornate hairstyles and suits, expressing the subjects’ cultural values in an attempt at self-preservation. The gallery features the art historical equivalent of a selfie, O’Brien said.</p>
<p class="p4">“I’m just so impressed that’s a resource that students can have,” said Allison Lackey, a visitor in the gallery. Students can enter the RISD Museum free of charge, which grants them access to an entire chronology of European art and architecture on the fifth floor as well as art from across the world. The spaces are more than just a display: They’re an opportunity to interact closely with the works and just think, O’Brien said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Playful photographs of Guantanamo Bay gift shop items and plaintive portraits of former inmates are strikingly paired in the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage’s latest installation, “Welcome to Camp America: Beyond Gitmo.” An exhibition by photographer and former civil rights-lawyer Debi Cornwall ’95, “Welcome to Camp America: Beyond Gitmo” employs these darkly comic contrasts as critical commentary. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cornwall’s photographs explore life within the United States’ Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Welding together politics and aesthetics, the exhibition comes as the next installment in the John Nicholas Brown Center’s tradition of displaying politically charged art. The exhibit, which seeks to reveal injustice and mistreatment, joins two other public programs focused on investigating the military prison’s history, legacy and future. The center is the second institution in the United States to display Cornwall’s installation. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The John Nicholas Brown Center “is really interested in how culture and art intersect to address social activism and social justice issues,” said Marisa Brown, assistant director of programs at the center. “Debi’s work is one of the best examples of how you can use art to address these issues.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cornwall explicitly centers her art around activism. The photographer spent 12 years working as a civil rights lawyer, using DNA analysis to free wrongfully imprisoned people. Though Cornwall parted ways with the occupation in 2014, she utilizes her art as a vehicle through which to call into question power structures’ unwarranted assaults on individuals’ civil rights. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“After stepping away from the life of a litigator, I was still consumed with the same kind of questions regarding power and its effects on individuals,” Cornwall said. “But I wanted to explore it in a very different way that invited connection and inquiry.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Guantanamo was an obvious choice for me,” Cornwall said. “The innocent men held for years there without charge are very similar to my exoneree clients in the United States. But unlike those DNA exoneree clients, the men in Guantanamo never receive a piece of paper saying they didn’t commit the crime.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Reflecting a law that explicitly prohibits taking photographs of current Guantanamo inmates’ faces, Cornwall sticks strictly to photographing her now-released subjects’ backs. For Cornwall, the artistic decision underscores the dehumanizing toil inherent in incarceration at Guantanamo. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“One artist that informs my work is Trevor Paglen,” Cornwall said. “He similarly finds way to visualize the inherently not-visual.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The inmates’ anguish is juxtaposed with flippant gift shop items on display, including a stuffed turkey vulture and a bobble head modeled after the likeness of Fidel Castro, creating a jarring effect for the viewer. The bleak back portraits contrast further with photographs that depict the comparatively relaxed lifestyles of military men on duty in Guantanamo. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s really interesting work,” said Esther Whitfield, associate professor of comparative literature and Hispanic studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It strikes me as a subtle commentary on the politics of Guantanamo and as a moving tribute to the communities that formed there, as well as to the way people look for home in places that are far from, and very unlike, their homes.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cornwall credits the development of her artistry to Brown, where she graduated with a double concentration in political science and modern culture and media. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m happy to see that Brown has become more of itself since I was last here,” Cornwall said. “The students and professors I’ve spent time with this week are as thoughtful and engaged as ever. And I’m happy to (see) more engagement with communities outside of Brown — engagement that addresses issues of national concern.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Musical collective Musical Forum brought critically-acclaimed Broadway hit “West Side Story” to Sayles Hall last weekend.</p>
<p class="p3">“West Side Story” is a modern-day take on “Romeo and Juliet” that takes place in New York’s Upper West Side. The musical centers around the star-crossed romance between Tony, played by Conor O’Byrne ’18, and Maria, played by Abby Espiritu ’19, characters from opposing gangs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Sharks are comprised of Puerto Rican immigrants and the Jets of white Americans.</p>
<p class="p4">The production was intended to be performed as a concert musical. “Essentially, the bare bones of a concert musical are that the songs are performed with minimal dialogue — to convey the plot, to convey emotions —without using a set,” said director Nicole Comella ’19.</p>
<p class="p4">Musical director Julian Gau ’19 shared Comella’s goal of musical storytelling. “All these distinctive moods … are within ‘West Side Story.’ I hope we can bring all these ideas and (keep) all these emotions intact.”</p>
<p class="p4">Chosen for its complex musical score, “West Side Story” gave a lot of material for the musicians to work with. “There’s a lot in the music. There are things that are really beautiful, there are things that are really groovy,” Gau said.</p>
<p class="p4">The minimal use of set design and choreography allowed for a focus on the production’s musical elements. Even so, the production team maintained that clear storytelling was necessary to tie the musical elements together. Performances from actors, particularly leads O’Byrne and Espiritu, evoked strong emotion, with impressive vocals and passionate portrayals of character.</p>
<p class="p4">“I was really happy with the way it turned out,” said stage manager Briana Nuñez ’19.</p>
<p class="p4">As with any musical, the actors’ performances worked in tandem with the music from the pit. Rehearsals for the show have run since early September, according to Nuñez.</p>
<p class="p4">Though the story ends tragically, it conveys a message of love despite difference and warns of the dangers of polarizing issues alienating groups of people. “There is a core human connection of love and community that exists between all of us. It’s something that is hard to forget,” Comella said.</p>
<p class="p4">In her director’s note, Comella references the intricacies of putting on a performance of “West Side Story” in this day and age. She cited “racism, police brutality, and a strained US-Puerto Rico relationship” as some of the challenges the musical balances. The star-crossed tale is “cautionary,” she wrote, and challenges audiences to think about the complexities addressed in the musical.</p>
<p class="p4">Because the show details the experience of Puerto-Rican immigrants, the production team behind “West Side Story” collected donations, all of which went toward United for Puerto Rico, an initiative brought forth by Beatriz Rossell, First Lady of Puerto Rico, to assist with the recent devastation caused by Hurricane Maria.</p>
<p class="p4">Musical Forum’s rendition of “West Side Story” garnered a huge amount of attention. Pre-reserved tickets were snapped up within minutes of their release, and the funds collected for United for Puerto Rico amounted to $1,066.74. “I’m really excited that so many people want to see us,” Gau said, continuing that “we’re hoping that, since so many people are coming, we can use this to help in some way.”</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The McCormack Family Theater was silent Thursday morning with the exception of one voice. Last week, poet Mei-mei Berssenbrugge read some of her poems from her new book, “Hello, the Roses,” a novel published by New Directions Publishing, a top press for experimental poetry and literature.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Born in Beijing, China, Berssenbrugge now lives in New Mexico and New York. Since completing her education at Barnard College, Reed College and Columbia, she has released 12 books of poetry and collaborated with artists utilizing various media, including music, visual arts and theatre performance. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Most students present at the reading are currently enrolled in the first-year seminar Writers on Writing, in which “Hello, the Roses” is currently being taught and discussed by Leigh Cole Swensen, professor of literary arts. Berssenbrugge “is one of the best artists writing in an experimental mode in contemporary poetry,” Swensen said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Swensen, who is in charge of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>picking speakers such as Berssenbrugge for the “Writers on Writing” events, says she chooses “poets that experiment with the boundaries of normal poetry.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Characteristic of Berssenbrugge’s poetry are long lines and paragraph-style sentences that “most poets today” would not experiment with, Swensen said. Berssenbrugge explores the dynamics of space and format and pushes the boundaries between poetry and prose, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the reading, Berssenbrugge read the poems “DJ Frogs,” “The New Boys” and the title piece “Hello, the Roses.” When asked by a student about her artistic process, Berssenbrugge said that when teaching children how to make poetry, she often tells them to “combine words and emotion to make music happen.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A common theme throughout Berssenbrugge’s poetry is delving into different dimensions. She pushes “language into saying more than what language usually can,” Swensen said. One of the most remarkable things about Berssenbrugge’s poetry was how<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“the beauty and patience of her language encourages readers into believing more than the extent of what we can normally perceive, while still saying something very important about being human,” Swensen added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Berssenbrugge said that during the process of her writing, her “mind takes on a sort of intellectual style.” Though she usually does not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>know what she wants to write, she said she has a question she wants to explore and that poetry writing is an “unconscious process at times.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>CineBrasil explores culture through film</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Film festival CineBrasil’s fourth annual edition showcased five recently produced Brazilian films that dealt with a wide range of subjects. The festival, which ran from Sept. 22 to Sept. 24., has been hosted by the Portuguese and Brazilian Studies Department and the Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs since 2014. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The selection this year included docudramas and feature films alike, most of which were produced by independent film producers. “This is more of a showcase of recent Brazilian film productions,” said Pedro Lopes de Almeida GS, a curator of the film festival. “We are not bound by a theme, we just want to show what’s going on, what’s being released and produced in Brazil.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have the film ‘Araby,’ which is like a road story, but it’s also a blue-collar worker story, but it’s also a love story, in some ways,” said Chloe Hill GS, another curator of the film festival. “We have ‘Jonas and the Backyard Circus,’ which is a sweet film about a young boy who was born into a circus family, but … it’s kind of a coming-of-age story. ‘Fresh Cutz’ is about three different barber shops. … It’s really cool and it’s really fun and it’s really contemporary. And then (there is) ‘The Third Shore,’ which is a look at a specific indigenous community within Brazil and that community’s relationship with the white Brazilians,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the films are Brazilian, the themes they deal with are universally relatable, according to Hill. “Fresh Cutz” is a socially engaged documentary, but it also deals with personal issues. “It’s about personal style and how you represent yourself. … What does your haircut mean about who you are? I think it speaks to us on many levels, both micro and macro, and personal and universal,” Hill said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Reaching out to the producers, that’s probably the largest bulk of our work. And getting their approval to screen movies,” Lopes de Almeida said. Brazil has no large distributor of movies, so “most of the films are what we would call independent movies. … It’s a very small crew, one producer, small budget, and it’s very hard for them to cross the borders and get to the US,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Another thing we spend a lot of time doing is thinking about who we want to invite to speak about these films afterward,” Hill said. “I think most people know Brazil through its music. … We wanted to show something else that is just as visceral and not only show it but create this community that would engage with the film, talk to us (and) ask questions,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A thoughtful discussion followed the screening of “Fresh Cutz,” led by Watufani Poe GS. Poe commented upon the conversations observed within the barbershops in the film, which ranged from being deeply personal to social issues. Occasionally, the dialogue turned problematic. Slurs were used, and “there were also moments — messed up moments — where … folks were talking about … where to buy a gun. Or talking about violence against women,” Poe said. These barbershops represent imperfect spaces of resistance, he said. “I think that the filmmaker made so much space for thinking through these questions,” Poe added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The way social issues and race relations were brought up in “Fresh Cutz” presented thought-provoking insight into the way Brazilian people interact with such issues. “We have all these kinds of ways that we talk about race in Brazil … but it’s important to see how people are talking about race in their communities in an everyday way,” Poe said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“For me, it was especially the fact that those barbershops … were spaces of male to male vulnerability,” said Abner Santos GS, who attended the screening of “Fresh Cutz.” “And I think this is an important role. … In those places … they feel free to be open and (talk) about their weaknesses … (and) about their pain, even if it’s emotional pain.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the spaces weren’t perfect, because “they are part of a greater narrative of being male, of sexism (and) many other problems,” Santos said. “But it still feels like it’s such an important place for them to have, in which they can open up, and in which they can be vulnerable.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Killers released “Wonderful Wonderful” Friday. The 43-minute album is their first in five years. The songs on the album cling to the nostalgic ’80s stadium rock sound The Killers have continued to maintain years past its prime. This time, Brandon Flowers takes his band’s leather jacket glam rock, complete with questionable Christian undertones, to a new level.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Killers bank on the same masturbatory masculinity that might have been kind of okay in the ’80s — if okay means obscene and in desperate need of reassessment. But they try — with a little desperation ­— to place it in a contemporary context.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Killers is like a child birthed by Bruce Springsteen, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Dave Matthews Band — a child that probably grew up to ride motorcycles, play poker and occasionally make people uncomfortable by throwing around terms like ‘babe’ without any sense of irony. This has shaped The Killers into an automatic oldies band, nostalgic before they even dropped their first album, and historical by 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Frankly, the last time leather jackets were cool was before Kurt Cobain died. The band promotes their image of campy masculinity with lyrics like “I know the direction/the lay of the land,” “I got news for you baby/ you’re looking at the man” and the real winner, “Who’s the man with the plan?” Here, listeners encounter an ode to mansplaining. To give Flowers the benefit of the doubt, listeners can assume he’s self-aware — no one who claims to play “alternative” rock would really promote manhood in this way, right? But then there’s the video of “I’m the Man”: four  minutes, 27 seconds of biceps, American flags and sparkly blazers. The last time this imagery would have impressed young people was when “Footloose” was still a thing. Even watching Flowers take shots wearing a cowboy hat, poker chips littered around the room, must make contemporary listeners want to barf out the past fifty years of toxic masculinity.</p>
<p class="p2">But if you’re a K<span class="s1">illers fan to begin with, which you probably are if you’re listening to this album, maybe you already knew what you had in store. And maybe The Killers is onto something, banking on vintage imagery like The Decemberists, who admit their songs can get a little Blurred-Lines-ish. Sure, taken out of context, their songs are all about dominant white men, but they take these themes out of old folk songs. They’re not definitive, they’re simply referential. And then listeners can choose to take the music with a grain of salt: enjoying the instrumentals and the stories without falling for them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some might even argue that in “Wonderful Wonderful” The Killers makes an attempt to “be real.” Flowers has an agenda — he is a Democrat and a Mormon, after all — a volatile combination to say the least. The song “Tyson vs. Douglas”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>uses boxing imagery to address his personal struggle with his wife’s mental health — and also his effort to never break down in front of his sons. Somehow, Flowers takes this otherwise heartfelt, if violent, song and adds an extra problematic layer of masculine showmanship. The song “Run for Cover” attempts to send a political message, and it’s pretty honest in a way only a band that uses phrases like “the dirtbag’s famous” and “he did her dirty” can get. That said, The Killers can’t help get a little aggressive, with a chorus that goes, “Run for cover, baby, don’t look back.” Maybe these political undertones<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>demonstrate to listeners that there’s more to The Killers than fringe and manhood. In a song packed with all the imagery that might appeal to supporters of President Trump, Flowers pretty frankly condemns the U.S. president, attacking fake news and Trump’s excuses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The album also contains outlier songs, including a rather bizarre, ethereal ballad entitled “Some Kind of Love.” The imagery is certainly cliche: Flowers sings about a wild bird, a graceful storm, a faithful child — painting a very expected image of serenity. The song, produced by Brian Eno, specifically references the work of the ’70s artist, which grants the album more grounded roots in twentieth century rock. One of the last songs on the album echoes music history as well; “Have All the Songs Been Written?” is a cross between Bob Dylan and Frank Sinatra, complete with immense whininess and romantic nostalgia. But in reality, the song seems disingenuous on an album that otherwise attempts some kind of pop-punk-glam-rock revival.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The album is a classic in a bad way, holding onto the hyper-masculine imagery that plays a role in the history of rock-and-roll and lost its edge in the ’50s — if it ever even had any value at all. The music is at least consistent with the image the band still projects even as their most relevant singles have faded into background music. The infatuation with nostalgia exhibited in the album shows that The Killers is old news — a band of Christian white men just can’t cut it in today’s alternative scene. Even if they’re secretly self-aware, no one can see it beneath their layers of outdated cliches and worn-out rock gear.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Five saucy, self-described “widows” are living in an idyllic, patriarchal 1950s suburban world, and boy are they “dealing with it.” By virtue of invitation to the annual quiche breakfast of the Susan B. Anthony Society for the Sisters of Gertrude Stein, audience members in the Production Workshop Downspace are also “dealing with it,” even while attempting to keep up with the performance’s dizzying comedic absurdism for over an hour.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The PW theater performance “Five Lesbians Eating a Quiche” ran for four shows this past weekend and was directed by Kayla Kirk ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Stage lighting illuminated a cheery 1950s kitchen — picture your grandma’s needlepoint and rooster-themed everything. Designed by Zachary Silberberg ’18, a Herald cartoonist, the set was a domestic wonderland; its cuteness only compromised by what appears to be a heavy, bolted metal door — the kind that belongs in a submarine or a fallout shelter. Three chipper women clothed in boldly patterned, conservative brunch attire burst onto the stage, eager for their annual “quiche” breakfast. “Oh my!” they exclaimed to one another shrilly with somewhat overwhelming vigor. “Hello! How are you?!” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Revolving around an egg-and-vegetable dish that contains no meat, the sisters’ all-female “no men, no meat, all manners” “quiche” breakfast is clearly no ordinary brunch. Enjoying each other’s presence, flirting with double entendres and certainly never eating meat, the actors’ commitment to seeming genuinely in lust with the breakfast dish was impressive and entertaining, though the script itself could probably have benefitted from some comedic variety. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Following along with the “sisters” improbable lunch, the audience became acquainted with one quirky member after another: Goofy Dale has a troubled past and harbors a deep distrust of men; sweet, simple-minded Wren only wants the best for her sisters; fork-tongued southern belle Lulie, the society president, demonstrates a bold physicality on stage that doesn’t waver from start to finish;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>British Ginny is always at odds with the propriety expected of her; and Vern, clever and brazen, never fails to put the team on her back.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite certain comedic shortcomings, the audience was engaged and laughing throughout the performance due to the dynamic and interactive efforts of the cast. Performance-goers were handed nametags as they walked into the Downspace to signify that they, too, were members of the Sisterhood. People in the front row were called out and directly addressed on occasion, and one lucky audience member, whose nametag read “Marjorie,” had the privilege of being spotlighted and shamed at regular intervals — the story goes that Marjorie dared to bring a sausage quiche to last year’s meeting and had been promptly ousted from the Sisterhood’s inner sanctum.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At moments when audience members assumed something shrewd was about to be said about domesticity and sexuality in 1950s United States, the absurdity intensified. Alarms sounded, signaling a Soviet nuclear attack, and the apocalypse was suddenly upon the sisters. Hysteria, madness and more shrill cries ensued. The ludicrous cacophony was successful<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>due to its flawless execution and sheer situational improbability. Ninety-something closeted lesbians were stuck in a recently refurbished community center basement with exactly enough rations to get them through the nuclear fallout.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Its success largely rested on the brilliant performances of Vern, played by Luna Floyd ’19, and Lulie, played by Haley Wong ’20, whose pregnancy — with a boy — further complicates life in the bunker for the Sisterhood.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the performance also had powerful but fleeting moments of gravitas, including a hope that the legalization of gay marriage will come to fruition as “soon” as the 1960s, which the audience knows to be painfully untrue. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Audience members emerged from the PW slightly exhausted and a little sweaty from all the muscle clenching that reflexively occurred every time the ladies denied their expectations. Though weary, the play’s reception was primarily positive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The jam-packed joke density — imagine laughing as much as you laughed in “Bridesmaids” — and all five actors’ gleaming enthusiasm managed to redeem the performance for its less stellar aspects. The play was written by two men, which is a tad ironic considering the play’s focus on the female experience in the 1950s. Still, it’s refreshing in its own way, demonstrating and celebrating the many dimensions of the lesbian identity without leaning on referential cynicism that so frequently underwrites contemporary comedies. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Stronger’ explores complex realities of heroism, recovery</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/26/stronger-explores-complex-realities-heroism-recovery/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The word “hero” gets tossed around a lot these days. It often carries with it a certain prefix — super — to the detriment of heroism everywhere. But what does it mean, “hero?” Is it an ugly American obsession, or an inescapably human desire to see goodness made real?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In “Stronger,” David Gordon Green’s powerful new film, Jeff Bauman (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds these questions unexpectedly thrust into his life after losing his legs in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. As he struggles to recover and restore some sense of normality to his life in the aftermath, Bauman is continually surprised, even troubled, when called a hero.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The film begins the day before the bombing, when Jeff gets off work at Costco and heads to a bar to watch the Red Sox. There, he sees his ex-girlfriend, Erin Hurley (Tatiana Maslany), raising money for the hospital she’s sponsoring for running the marathon the next day. Jeff takes up her collection box, telling everyone to “give up a round of Stellas” and donate to a good cause. He’s charming and perfectly at ease, in a goofy sort of way.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At first, it’s hard to imagine that he and Erin could be engaged in a “torrid melodrama,” amiable as Jeff is, but we soon learn that they have broken up and gotten back together three times already. Jeff sees their current separation as just another twist in their storyline. He tells Erin he’ll be waiting at the finish line for her, bearing a sign and a smile. Erin has her doubts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And, though he does show up the next day, standing at the finish line and holding a poster resplendent in marker-drawn lettering, Erin doesn’t see him. She sees only a burst of smoke and flame a mile ahead of her on one side of the street.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From there, the film does not cut to Jeff lying bloody and delirious on the street, as you may expect. Green and screenwriter John Pollono aren’t interested in the shock-and-awe effect that comes with raw images of gore and terror, and it’s to their credit that they never accede to the xenophobia that often seeps into stories of terrorism. They aim to tell a different story focused on the hard realities of trauma and recovery and the troubled but loving relationship that gets Jeff through.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This guiding ethos is captured in a shot at the hospital, when Jeff gets the dressings on his amputated limbs changed for the first time. Green positions his camera at an angle, so that Jeff’s face is on one side of the frame and Erin’s the other as she does her best to comfort him, while his legs rest blurry in the background — detached, foreign. It’s at once intimate and pregnant with meaning, sensitive to the complex struggle that lies before him.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even within all this solemnity, the film maintains a warm sense of humor. Much of this comes from Jeff and his family, a bunch of blunt, testy, working-class Bostonians who talk loud and laugh louder. In a few scenes, “Stronger” even moves into “Jackass” territory, as Jeff and his brothers drunkenly mine his disability for physical comedy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His family is not without problems, though. Jeff lives with his mother, Patty (Miranda Richardson), in a small apartment, and the two of them have an uneasy relationship. They both drink too much, and Patty is more excited by Jeff’s newfound celebrity than he is. When Jeff refuses an Oprah interview, Patty gets upset — “I don’t know where I’d be without Oprah,” she says. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Erin ends up being the one reliable adult in the room — cleaning up after Jeff and his mother, making sure that Jeff gets to therapy and protecting him from people who want to turn him into nothing but a spectacle. Maslany is superb in the role and brings a firm resolve to the character. She is compassionate, and maybe too giving, but she expects Jeff to work just as hard as she does on his recovery. When she finally snaps, you can sense the deep well of feeling behind her fury and frustration. Maslany knows how to shout without making it feel like empty Oscar-baiting.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The same can be said of her on-screen partner. Though the film has been justly criticized for hiring an able-bodied actor to play Bauman, Gyllenhaal’s performance is a wonder. His physical commitment is complete, and he has an assured grasp of Jeff’s vast emotional range. With pain behind his eyes but a strength behind his smile, Gyllenhaal shows trauma to be an unwieldy beast that can crop up where you least expect it and hurt the people you need the most.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The middle of the film drags as it sinks deeper into Bauman’s depression, and the end occasionally slips into mawkishly inspirational territory, where “Go Sox!” becomes a stirring rallying cry, and a we-can-do-this voiceover is leaned on a bit too heavily. But the bulk of the film maintains an exquisitely clear-eyed approach, from the finely-tuned performances to Green’s clean, thoughtful compositions. “Stronger” treats its subject with the requisite sincerity and artistry to achieve something rare among inspirational dramas — it inspires.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On any given Tuesday or Thursday night, Visiting Professor of Music and Orchestra Director Brandon Keith Brown can be found in Alumnae Hall, presiding over the assemblages of undergraduate performers who serve as the fundamental elements of his reflexive flair and measured technicality. The orchestra is currently rehearsing Brahms’ First Symphony — a piece that, in its swirling structure and Beethovian emulation, captures the dynamism and tradition clearly present in Brown’s incarnation of the University orchestra. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Sweet remembrance</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Like Brahms himself, the newly appointed conductor appears compelled by a complex anxiety of his influences. Brown aspires to embed himself and his orchestra in classical music’s extensive tapestry of tradition.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“That tradition is the most valuable thing in my teaching and conducting ­— it’s something you can’t find in a book,” Brown said, underscoring the necessity of engaging with a lineage of composers. “I make peace with myself by pretending that the original composer of a piece sits down at rehearsals and is comfortable with my orchestra and its musicians’ individual interpretations of the composer. If you aren’t speaking for the art, you should be quiet.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Brown’s tracing of the classical music tradition might have been most literally realized during his three-week-long Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy Scholarship, during which he undertook a rigorous and extensive study of Mendelssohn’s life and music. The once-in-a-lifetime award is granted to prominent conductors outside of Germany and encompasses research opportunities and private lectures on the German Romantic composer, as well as the chance to conduct a concert of the composer’s works. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“I got to see the towns he lived in, as well as original parts of his and other composers’ compositions, such as Beethoven’s Fifth,” Brown said. “Germany is wonderful in that they value music over everything. No matter what your education level is there, you know who Mahler or Mendelssohn was.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Professor Brown is sharing his admiration of the Germanic orchestral tradition with us by choosing classic repertoire like Brahms and Mahler symphonies and moving the instrument sections to mimic a Berlin setup,” said Max Naftol ’19, a bassist in the orchestra. The symphonies are “great learning opportunities for students and I can’t wait to show the Brown community what we’re up to at our October 20th and 21st concerts,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>A portrait of the conductor </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The orchestra director’s experience with classical music began at age nine. A native of North Carolina, Brown learned composition from an “incredible” elementary school music teacher. The conductor subsequently composed until high school, when he began playing violin, and was admitted to the North Carolina School of the Arts shortly after. From there, Brown attended music programs at Oberlin College and Northwestern University. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">As an undergraduate, Brown studied under violin instructors Roland and Almita Vamos. Since then, his estimable resume has come to include training by the illustrious David Zinman and Lorin Maazel — accomplishments joined by studies at the Johns Hopkins Peabody Institute and a position directing the New York Philharmonic. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Rhapsody in Brown </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The virtuoso is set to fulfill his roles as Visiting Professor of Music and Orchestra Director through the 2017-18 academic year, aspiring to realize some “very high artistic goals” before leaving the University in a year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“The technicality of the musicians is no different than that of those in the top conservatories, so I’m focused more on helping them develop and mature as musicians,” Brown said. “I use the Socratic method and try to get students to interrogate questions like why notes and key signatures are where they are in a piece. … I need the students I’m teaching to realize that the destination is not as important as the journey in education, no matter how painful that journey might be. And, so far, I’m very impressed with how capable Brown students are of thinking about music in a way they never have before.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Stressing extensive mentorship toward the members of his orchestra, Brown said he strives toward “engaging the imagination of (his) musicians and helping them sound better than they ever could have thought they could sound.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The conductor is decidedly less passionate about the spaces his musicians practice in, deeming them “wet,” a phrase from classical music vernacular that refers to echo-ridden orchestra halls. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“The University’s spaces are historic, regal and august, with something very intriguing about them,” Brown said. “They just don’t work particularly well in a concert setting because of how echoey they are. But that’s not going to stop me — it’s all simply a matter of putting people in the right places,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“For orchestra veterans, he has a significantly more formal demeanor that takes some getting used to,” Naftol said. “There’s going to be a bit of a learning curve as both Professor Brown and the orchestra musicians get to know one another.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">“Brown is extremely passionate and attentive to all individuals during orchestra,” said Rainbow Chen ’21, a bassist in the orchestra. “Although he can be quite intimidating, it’s cool to see he truly loves his work.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Visiting Professor of Music and Orchestra Director Brandon Keith Brown's experience with classical music began at age six. In fact, it began at age nine. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Atlantic Ocean was draped in sparkling teal scales and bright blue slippers.</p>
<p class="p2">“Introducing, the Atlantic!” was the only forewarning the audience received before the clown performer entered the room, squeaking and gasping to symbolize the ocean’s impending death.</p>
<p class="p2">This was one of many performances featured at the Activist Body Symposium Sept. 29. During the event, students, faculty and members of the Providence community gathered to discuss the political power of bodies and the spaces they occupy. Dance scholars, graduate students and visiting researchers were invited to speak and perform about the impact of human bodies on social spaces.</p>
<p class="p2">“We were asking, what would happen if we looked at … the body as a non-negotiable power source,” said Sarah Wilbur, the organizer of the event and a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in Dance Studies. She was interested in “how people change the world through how they participate, … through the way they move,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">The symposium lasted all day and featured roundtables on research perspectives, workshops and performances.</p>
<p class="p2">Leon Hilton, assistant professor of theatre arts and performance studies, discussed bodies within the context of disability activism. Hilton studies photojournalism from protests led by disability activist groups. In his talk, he showed a picture of two police officers carrying away an unnamed activist.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’m thinking about these images as photographs that have been co-produced by the activists and by the repressive forces that are depicted in them,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Police “appear to be roughly handling, detaining and, in many cases, arresting bodies that have been deemed vulnerable enough to elicit state and federal protections,” Hilton said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It seems to me … that these protests have perhaps been staged precisely in order to produce these photographs, to elicit the gaze of the mass public,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">“These activists submit to and embrace the process of spectacularizing the vulnerability of their own bodies,” Hilton said. These strategies have made their way into front pages and headlines, “such as one that recently appeared in The Nation, which said disability rights activists are the real heroes of the health care fight, and I find it hard to disagree with this statement,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Stefanie Miller GS, a PhD candidate in the TAPS department, considered how activists’ bodies and the spaces they occupy relate to “stolen indigenous land.”</p>
<p class="p2">“I do research on performances of protest within the context of southern colonial Canada,” Miller said. She studies movements like flash mob round dances and hopes to drive conversations on the notion of “performing on stolen indigenous land … and also to think a little about the possible solidarities between social movements in Canada,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">Orlando Hernández finished off the event with a tap dance performance that interrogated ideas surrounding de-colonization. His performance took place at the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts where it moved up the stairs from the entrance of Martinos Auditorium into the Cohen Gallery. Hernández, dressed in a white cloth outfit, explored themes of colonialism and power by tap dancing to a 16th-century text that Spaniards would read to native people upon conquering their land.</p>
<p class="p2">“There’s two parts of it. There’s moving through the architecture. … Then there’s being among these other bodies who are sort of in the same situation as you. There’s definitely this kind of amorphous unity of trying to figure out where he’s going,” said Francesca Gallo ’19, an attendee of the event. “It was incredible.”</p>
<p class="p2">The event aimed to transcend academic study of the body and space. “This isn’t just a scholarly issue,” Wilbur said.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’m just interested in the idea of what functions bodies can perform outside of just moving to express something, or within the confines of dance and choreography,” Gallo said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Pamela Z suspends crowd with cross-platform performance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Pamela Z — and yes, that is her real last name —is known for her multilayered compositions that fuse eerie, futuristic audio with spoken word and film. The globally lauded composer and multimedia artist successfully simulated the clamor and quiet of human experience during her performance in Studio 1 of the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts on Friday.</p>
<p class="p4">Before Z even graced the stage, the sheer quantity of high-tech equipment in the room augured an extraordinary experience for audience members. Microphones, motion sensors, surround-sound speakers and a projector screen were connected by a tangle of wires that all ultimately snaked back to Z’s MacBook Pro — where the magic really happened. Using a voice altering software program called MAX MSPE, Z toyed with her own vocals in real time throughout the whole of the performance —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a complicated process that distinguishes her work from that of similar artists.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Z greeted the audience in a neofuturistic, all-black ensemble — the kind of outfit someone might wear to an important cocktail event on the moon. When she faced the audience, her smile glowed bright with benevolence, and when she approached the microphone, the room quite literally began to tremble.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Z’s performance was a powerfully visceral experience. A master of technology on the cutting edge of audio composition, she didn’t just mix sounds — she summoned them. The audience sat transfixed as Z roused tinny staccatos from distant speakers with the flick of a wrist and manipulated motion sensors with the careful intention of a snake charmer. Each of her movements worked to create a more dynamic multimedia experience.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In one composition, Z attached motion sensors to her hands and, standing in front of a projected “ocean,” enacted the feeling of drowning — effectively capturing the fear of being lost in translation. In a later piece, she began by crinkling bubble wrap into the microphone, a sound that then framed a wide spectrum of whispers, echoes and pulsing, operatic scales. At the end of the piece, Z approached the microphone and sensuously whispered two words: “secret code” — a detail that probably should’ve made people laugh, but didn’t.</span></p>
<p class="p4">In another instance, Z’s art took a deliberate turn for the humorous. Blurry typewriter keys tumbled across the screen behind the stage as she whispered “Dear Pen Pal” over the sharp sound of clacking keys. In distinctive robotic fashion, she began to repeat, “I do hope I get my Mac back soon, un-til then, you prob-ab-ly won’t hear from me too of-ten.”</p>
<p class="p4">Anyone else who attempted to similarly parody the digital age would likely be dismissed as trite. Yet there’s something about Z’s clear mastery of her craft — coupled with her generous and periodically unserious disposition — that redeems her occasionally cringe-worthy content. When she finished performing her final piece, the entire audience rose to a sixty-second standing ovation — the kind that’s usually reserved for Beyoncé or magicians who escape tiny cages suspended from terrifying heights. Her craft was unique and otherworldly, and for that she deserves unending applause.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Global Americana,” the latest exhibit at the John Carter Brown Library, comprises a range of perspectives through which to look at the early modern history of the Americas. Through its array of commentaries and historiographies, the comprehensive exhibit charts a global course for the library’s previously Americas-centered collection. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Global Americana,” which opened in early September, will provide visitors with the opportunity to pore over the curated portion of the library’s intimidatingly vast collection throughout the fall semester. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Histories grounded in economic, medicinal and environmental subject matter, among others, compose the exhibit’s primary documents. Though all of the objects relate to the library’s focus on the history of the Western hemisphere, the exhibit makes a claim to its “global” name by including historical documents and illustrations centered on transatlantic discourse.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Even though all the items deal with the Early Americas, they’re still connected to every part of the world in some way, be it in what a text relates to or the parts of the world it traveled,” said Tara Kingsley, the library’s coordinator of academic programming and public outreach. “The exhibition covers so many themes, some of which relate to specific initiatives the library has, such as native and indigenous studies.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Its annals include Spanish scientific drawings of New World armadillos and a historical record that draws comparisons between Central American chocolate and Arabian coffee. Composed in languages ranging from English to Portuguese to Quechua, the collection further emphasizes the global in its linguistic bending of boundaries, featuring objects that place multiple languages alongside one another. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the most valuable items on display is a facsimile of a world map dated ca.1513 CE. “It’s one of the earliest maps in which the term ‘America’ appears as a toponym,” Kingsley said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Academics and scholars across the world were responsible for choosing objects from the library’s collection and writing explanations that contextualize pieces’ places — both in the broader histories of the Americas and their interactions with the rest of the Early Modern world. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Some of (the scholars) are fellows at our library and others are graduate students at the University,” Kingsley said. “But the majority are scholars from different countries that had access to the digitized versions of our collection. … The fact that so much of our collection is digitized already enabled us to bring in all these different people.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These globe-trotting scholars include Irna Podgomy of Argentina’s Museo de la Plata, as well as Mark Thumer of the University of London. Their cosmopolitan commentary underscores the distinctly global context of the exhibit’s contents. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sherri Cummings GS, whose research centers on early 17th to 19th-century African-American and African Atlantic history, helped curate the exhibition. Her main contribution was a letter from an anti-abolitionist New Englander objecting to the historic Sumerset v. Stewart case, which, citing English common law, declared chattel slavery illegal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Special programming during Family Weekend is set to help promote both the exhibit and the John Carter Brown Library’s collections as a whole, Kingsley said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For Family Weekend, we’ll be hosting a Saturday program with a number of professors at Brown, including (Robert) Douglas Cope, Emily Owens and Felipe Rojas (Silva), that relates to their research in the collection and the objects in ‘Global Americana,’” Kingsley said. “The idea is to get more people aware of our library and how its contents relate to their (professors’) research.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Dreamlandia” — a reference to the nostalgia for a home of dreams, sorrows and memories left behind by an undocumented girl living in Texas — is something of an autological title. The play, presented by Sock and Buskin and the Theatre Arts and Performance Studies department, tells the story of a group of people living near the Mexican-American border, with its central plot line punctuated by surreal dream sequences and omniscient perspectives of the places the characters travel between.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many central themes piece the production together — internalized racism, xenophobia and Mexico’s war on narcotics. In telling this story, director Sarah dAngelo, Assistant Professor of the Theatre Arts and Performance Studies hopes that “audiences will gain a greater awareness of the untold issues of border politics, ... especially in relation to human rights,” she wrote in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The play’s brief opening scene — marked by a woman’s screams<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>amidst dramatic lighting — sets off a series of events that bring the characters to their initial circumstances. At the beginning of the play, a woman dies of childbirth because her husband refuses to take her to the hospital for fear that this might tip the authorities to his status as a criminal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rather than admitting to his role in his cocaine-addicted wife’s passing, drug lord Celestino Robles, played by Marlon Jiménez Oviedo ’22 MFA, accuses the midwife Dolores (Paola Jimenez ’20) of witchcraft. He then proceeds to have her and her family deported, separating them from Dolores’ white American lover and causing her irreparable trauma that leads to her early demise some years later.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ana Rosa Marx ’18.5 plays Blanca, a tenacious and resilient young Mexican woman, who decides to cross the border in search for her biological father, bringing along her “brain-damaged” brother, Pepín (Jorge Sanchez Garcia ’20), whose presence makes for comic relief but also reveals some of the most hypocritical aspects of proponents of border control. Her mother, though deceased, appears to nearly all of the characters in hallucinations, reminding them of their strengths and previous follies. In Texas, Blanca meets Celestino’s grown-up son, a young man named Lazaro (Sebastián Otero Oliveras ’18), chained to an island due to his father’s fear of the witchy midwife’s “curse” on their family.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Blanca eventually finds her father, Frank (Ben Hayslett ’18.5), who — ironically — is revealed to be the head of the border patrol guard and Celestino’s right-hand man. When she is caught by guards who work for her father, she finds work as a tutor for the newly released Lazaro. Blanca’s introduction to this world enables the audience to plunge into the life of Celestino and his business as a drug lord. Celestino and his partner Sonia (Yurema Perez-Hinojosa ’20) attempt to train Lazaro to take over his drug maquiladora empire. At the same time, Blanca<span class="s3">“Dreamlandia” — a reference to the nostalgia for a home of dreams, sorrows and memories left behind by an undocumented girl living in Texas — is something of an autological title.</span> to contain her shock and confusion when she discovers her father is white—“What am I? What race dries up when another grows?” Celestino’s hypocrisy shows when he later admits he crossed the border illegally as a child — yet has no sympathy for his undocumented workers who are murdered in droves and demands Blanca’s deportation. In a comedic subplot, Pepín ironically becomes a border patrol guard, only to be stripped of his role when his undocumented status is found out.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The play’s bittersweet ending comes after devastation and loss befalls each of the main characters. But reconciliation and repentance bring closure and true freedom to Blanca, Lazaro and their fathers. Their fates are left ultimately uncertain, but the viewer leaves with a sense of optimism: as maintained by a business partner of Lazaro’s — “the real narcotic is hope.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Lumen’ gallery to provide new meditative space in Granoff</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On a Tuesday afternoon in the Cohen Gallery, composer Eric Nathan, assistant professor of music in composition-theory, and landscape architect Loretta Gargan stand in a nearly empty room. The walls are painted white and light funnels in through a large window facing the garden in front of the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. In the middle of the room is a series of five simple white pews. Gargan and Nathan are waiting for a delivery of thyme. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This month, the gallery will provide a daily meditative refuge, Nathan said. The artists will offer film, music, lighting, pews and burning thyme to create an environment unlike any other on campus. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The pews are the beginning elements of what artist Catherine Wagner describes as a “site-specific immersive multisensory experience.” “Lumen,” a collaboration between Wagner, Nathan, Gargan and architect Thomas Kelley, will be in the Cohen Gallery from Oct. 5 to Nov. 5. The exhibit will incorporate elements of music, film, architecture and nature to transform the gallery into a space for visitors to meditate and reflect. The project has been shown twice before, in a Cryptoporticus at the American Academy in Rome in 2014 and the Yellow Barn Festival in Vermont in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When Wagner and Gargan traveled around Italy during their residency at the American Academy in Rome, Gargan said they found themselves “overcome by the magnitude of it all.” Inspired by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the experience, as well as Pope Francis’ “Lumen Fidei” and early sermons — in which he considered the possibility of new beginnings — Wagner and Gargan began to form a plan for an artistic response. They wanted to create a secular space that evoked a message of hope. As their project took shape, they began to work with Kelley and Nathan, fellow Rome prize recipients, on what would become “Lumen.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The experience of living in Rome sparked the echoes of religion that play a role in the space, Gargan said. “We have been inspired ... (by) old places,” Nathan said. Although Nathan does not practice Catholicism, he wonders how people can approach these seemingly historical spaces in a contemporary setting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Working together on the project meant each artist could use their area of expertise as part of the larger vision. Although each artist came from a unique background, most of the conversations incorporated all of their voices, Wagner said. The artists realized that their collaboration did not mean splitting up the work. In places where they did feel constraints, they found a space for creative exploration, Nathan said. He adjusted his composition to match the cadence of the film, finding a fruitful challenge in working with the other artists.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In coming to Granoff, “Lumen” has moved from an underground, church-like space in Rome to a contemporary gallery. There are adjustments being made as the work is reformatted to fit its new environment, while maintaining the powerful aspects that attracted hundreds of visitors in Rome.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> In a past exhibition, a visitor expressed a desire for “Lumen” to be at his funeral. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I recommend people to approach this and experience it in any way they choose,” Nathan said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Columbus’ finds beauty in simplicity, duality</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Kogonada’s directorial debut in the 2017 film “Columbus” serves as the pioneer of a new genre of beautifully-made, self-aware and quiet films in that it slows down the plot and switches out traditional narrative tropes in favor of meticulous character development and thoughtful dialogues about family and aesthetics.</p>
<p class="p2">The film takes place in Columbus, Indiana and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>centers around Jin, a middle-aged Korean-American book translator<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that returns from Korea to care for his comatose architect father, and Casey, a recent high school graduate who has put off college to look after her troubled mother.</p>
<p class="p2">The two characters, diligently portrayed by John Cho and Haley Lu Richardson, navigate disparate life paths at first, but fatefully meet and quickly bond over their shared anguish and family troubles despite their differences in background and age.</p>
<p class="p2">Until Casey decides to leave Columbus to pursue her dreams of becoming an architect in the quasi-climax of the film, the new pair of friends talks about each other’s lives on outings to various famous architectural sites around Columbus, a hotbed of mid-century modernist architecture.</p>
<p class="p2">The two first encounter each other on Casey’s smoke break from her job at the library, when she catches Jin on the other side of a fence outside of the bed and breakfast where Jin is residing while in Columbus. This initial encounter channels the film’s central ethos of similarity despite difference.</p>
<p class="p2">Most prominent in this scene is the emergence of the theme of racial tension and Casey’s insularity developed through her upbringing in a racially homogenous community:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Casey asks Jin, who has just gotten off a phone call in Korean, “You speak English?” “Of course,” he says, his response suggesting that this is not the first time he has fielded this line of questioning in a small town like Columbus.</p>
<p class="p2">The disconnect between Jin and Casey manifests in the physical black, wrought-iron fence between them. They begin to walk along it as the conversation unravels, yet curiously never cross it to meet one another and share a side of the fence. Perhaps this alludes to the reserved nature of the film. While the two characters initially hint at mutual romantic interest, their relationship never develops beyond friendship.</p>
<p class="p2">Yet the fence more critically speaks to the Kogonada’s emphasis on aesthetics; architecture does not serve as mere setting, but as a commanding force, one just as important as any of the characters. As tensions grow within Jin and Casey’s separate family dramas as well as between them, the architectural sites that frame their conversations continue to magnify in scale and intensity. The visual content of “Columbus” is enough to satisfy and pleasure the viewer.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite certain merits of gradually building drama, the true demise of the film is in the plot’s slow and frankly uneventful development. Kogonada eschews the conventions of rising action, climax and resolution. While reflective of the pace of a small town, this realist approach can bore the audience. One particularly self-indulgent camera shot from a car window shows Casey chasing after Jin, her figure slowly falling out of focus for upwards of a long, painful minute. Yet perhaps it’s about time for American audiences, who have long been desensitized by high-action blockbusters about superheroes, to ease into appreciating visual-heavy scenes with minimal dialogue ­— the bread and butter of foreign cinema for decades.</p>
<p class="p2">If viewers can find the strength to bear with its slow, unnerving sense of solace in the place of rapid fire action, they will find Kogonada’s film to be an effective meditation on American life today, away from turmoil. Rather than mirroring the chaotic, traumatic events dominating the media, “Columbus” offers a reprieve with the portrayal of an unlikely encounter in an insular, often overlooked part of the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The audience, mimicking the bright spotlight, was transfixed by Peter Markus as his reading teleported them into the sensory world of his unique novels. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Peter Markus, author of “The Singing Fish,” “Bob, or Man on Boat,” “We Make Mud” and others, conducted a book reading at the University as part of the Writers on Writing seminar hosted by the Literary Arts Department. The seminar provides students the opportunity to attend readings and interact with the accomplished writers behind the works they are studying. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For this seminar, Markus read an excerpt from his book “The Singing Fish,” which the students had studied that week. Markus engaged the audience with his humorous remark comparing reading his older work to listening to one’s favorite old record. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“The Singing Fish” is an abstract book that effortlessly captures the sense of wonder and innocence of two brothers, the dual protagonists of the book. Markus contrasts this playfulness with graphic and brutal imagery to highlight the antithetical view of violent ideas through a lens of youthful innocence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Markus’ “cadence driven” style is highly influenced by his background as a “failed” musician, as “sound is the one driving force” of his writing, he said. This lyrical quality can be seen in the use of literary techniques of repetition and circumlocution. His organic artistic process was also guided by his other senses as he emphasized the importance of “the visual texture of each word.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The value of the acoustics ensured that Markus’ reading created a distinctive experience in comparison to silently reading his books. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Markus further discussed the readers’ value and influence upon his writing process. He emphasized the organic quality of this process. However, he often broke the fourth wall in his book as a “playful acknowledgement” to his readers; it is “Peter Markus underneath the words,” he told the audience, highlighting the intimacy and passion behind his writin</span><span class="s3">g.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Droves of students convened on Wriston Quadrangle for Saturday’s “Gigs on the Grass” music festival, the second iteration of the University’s exclusively student-centered music festival. Flanked by Wriston’s Georgian architecture and enveloped by the co-mingling scents of Narragansett beer and the last gasps of summer, the event’s 15 artists evinced a breadth of styles and a depth of talent. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Student-run music groups can face a problem of visibility, with both little space for <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/27/burgeoning-alternative-band-layovers-shakes-college-hill/">rehearsal</a> and a dearth of publicity. Co-organized by the Brown Concert Agency and the Class Coordinating Board, the festival was a means of displaying and promoting the University’s homegrown musicality to a wider audience, organizers said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The main thing we’re doing with ‘Gigs’ is prioritizing student talent, which creates an environment where students are celebrating each other and their accomplishments,” said Pia Struzzieri ’18, vice-president of CCB 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The music scene here is really supportive and events are happening all the time,” Struzzieri said. “The main places I see people performing are in other students’ basements or backyards,” she added, noting the house shows that take place at such venues as Watermyn and 55 John St. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“But (those shows) just generally don’t have a very broad audience,” Struzzieri said, underscoring the self-selecting nature of the people who attend these shows. “‘Gigs’ is an event that tries to bring that same feeling of community and intimacy to an audience that isn’t necessarily connected to the music scene.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this respect, “Gigs” is successful, attracting at least 1,400 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/10/19/gigs-grass-features-student-musical-talent/">people</a> in its first installment last year. This year, organizers say the festival might have drawn an even larger audience — a phenomenon Struzzieri attributes to the change in venue from Pembroke to Wriston. The latter location “made it easier to come to the festival impulsively,” Struzzieri said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were really happy we got the event moved to Wriston Quad because in our eyes, it was a way to expose more people to the artists,” said Michael Mills ’20, who, alongside Babette Thomas ’20, was the Brown Concert Agency’s chair for this year’s “Gigs.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The change was ultimately a positive one and we were pleased with the turnout,” Mills added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“BCA helped CCB judge auditions and create an exciting lineup,” Mills said. “The concert agency also helped bring in judges from the local music community and made sure the event ran as smoothly as possible the day of.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The festival featured artists across the musical spectrum, from the indie-rock outfit Attic Wood to the neo-soul collective KiwiiSour to rapper Express. According to Mills, the decision to exhibit artists representative of a variety of genres was a conscious one. “It was definitely something we kept in mind during auditions,” Mills said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was really great to see representation from groups comprising people of color, as well as from different genres like funk and hip-hop,” said Nicholas Fah-Sang ’20. “There’s very little to be gained from the kind of cut-and-dry indie rock acts that are prominent on college campuses, so it was cool to see artists like DIASPORA and Express challenging that dominance.” </span></p>
&nbsp;

<strong><span class="s1">Correction: A previous version of this article referred to Pia Struzzieri ’18 as the president of CCB 2018. In fact, she is the vice-president of CCB 2018. The Herald regrets the error.</span></strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most young composers only dream of learning songwriting from a master like Rosanne Cash, daughter of country music legend Johnny Cash. Brown made that a reality on Oct. 4, when Cash and her husband, John Leventhal, taught a songwriting masterclass and performed selections from their Grammy award-winning music at the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During this program, the first of the Brown Arts Initiative’s Songwriting Series, Cash and Leventhal critiqued four original songs performed by student songwriters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The idea of mixing a master class with a concert was so interesting. … It was kind of a magical combination,” said Joseph Butch Rovan, director of the Brown Arts Initiative. “Rosanne herself was very excited and interested in that format. … Afterwards, she said that she had been listening to her own songs in a different way … (after) teaching songwriting.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The concert took place just days after the Las Vegas massacre, which did not go without comment. Before the student songwriters took to the stage, Cash discussed her op-ed for the New York Times published Oct. 3, in which she implored country musicians to oppose the National Rifle Association and to “pull apart the threads of patriotism and lax gun laws that (the NRA) has so subtly and maliciously intertwined.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This horrific event happened in my shared office space of music festivals,” she remarked. We “have the right to speak out as citizens,” Cash said, defying those who tell her to “shut up and sing” — which, Cash added, is “anatomically impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This dialogue elicited impassioned applause from the audience. “I was amazed that so many people knew (the op-ed and) had already read this piece. I mean, it just had happened the day before,” Rovan said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The program returned to the young songwriters — Jamie Atschinow ’20, Madeleine Olson ’18, local musician Anthony Savino and Northampton High School senior Galen Winsor — who performed their original songs and discussed them with Cash and Leventhal. These musicians are all students in a songwriting workshop taught by Julian Saporiti GS.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cash and Leventhal “were so kind to all of us and the feedback was super constructive,” Olson said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m definitely going to use their comments to keep writing (my) song.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I hadn’t performed an original song for anyone before the workshop. So to suddenly be singing it in front of a crazy talented, professional performer was pretty intimidating,” Atschinow said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the workshop portion, Cash and Leventhal performed selections from their repertoire, including “Money Road,” “Etta’s Tune” and “The Sunken Lands.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cash’s “lyrics are amazing. They’re full of really powerful, succinct details that immediately paint a picture,” Rovan remarked, adding that the masterclass and performance bolstered the initiative’s “goal of connecting across the campus and the community.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s really exciting that the arts initiative is getting these kinds of people to perform here because it’s an amazingly intimate, small environment (in which) to hear this kind of music,” said Jeffrey Brock, an audience member and director of the Data Science Initiative.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Lengthy ‘Blade Runner 2049’ fails to live up to prestigious original</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Blade Runner 2049” is, first and foremost, a cash grab. That does not mean that it’s a bad movie — it simply means that the film’s raison d’etre is something to overcome as opposed to something to live up to. And “Blade Runner 2049” tries very </span><span class="s2">hard to overcome, with a visual style and deliberate pace that at least suggest a film of serious artistic intention. But it never quite comes up with a satisfying answer to the question, “Why am I not watching ‘Blade Runner’ right now?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Maybe that’s unfair, but the film invites the comparison, conceived as a sequel to Ridley Scott’s 1982 masterpiece. Theoretically, “Blade Runner 2049” deserves to be taken on its own terms, but try and watch it without thinking of — and pining for — the original.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Blade Runner 2049” picks up 30 years after the events of the first film. The Tyrell Corporation has gone bankrupt and has been co-opted by the Wallace Corporation, which itself has gotten into the replicant game. Some of Tyrell’s old replicants, or bioengineered androids, are still around — the Nexus 8S models, specifically — and these replicants are being retired, i.e. executed, by government agents known as Blade Runners.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The film opens on a blade runner, a replicant known as K (Ryan Gosling), tracking down Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), a rogue Nexus 8S. K travels over depleted landscapes in his flying car — a Peugeot, in a surprising bit of product placement — before landing at an isolated farm where he finds his target. Morton resists retirement, to put it gently, </span><span class="s1">and director Denis Villeneuve shoots the ensuing fight with a bracing physicality. But more important is the box K finds buried beneath a tree outside the house. Upon forensic investigation, the box’s contents are revealed to be the bones of a replicant woman who seems to have given birth. This possibility — a procreating replicant and the existence of the resulting child — drives the rest of the film.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After K completes his mission, he returns to Los Angeles, and the film reveals its vision of the city Scott rendered so strikingly in “Blade Runner.” On all counts, Villeneuve’s version suffers from the comparison. Whereas Scott’s Los Angeles was a marvel of visual texture, a crowded, gritty urban jungle bathed in neon light and constant rain, Villeneuve’s is cold, clean and anonymous — it looks like </span><span class="s2">countless other futuristic cities we’ve seen on screen.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Back at K’s apartment, we meet Joi, K’s holographic girlfriend, or servant, or something. Whatever her role is, it’s one of subservience and mindless devotion, and it’s a letdown. In the original film, Deckard — Harrison Ford’s character — had a strange, disturbing relationship with a female replicant, Rachael, in which romance and abuse uneasily commingled. K and Joi’s relationship is fraught with no such complications, and the film never bothers to interrogate or develop it — instead content to make an Oscar play for “Most Interminable Sex Scene of the Year.” Also, without giving too much away, “Blade Runner 2049” interprets Deckard and Rachael’s relationship in the least interesting way possible, erasing its complications in order to serve the demands of the plot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Other characters soon emerge, including Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright), K’s boss at the Los Angeles Police Department and Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), head of the Wallace Corporation. Wallace, who seems to speak only in vaguely biblical expressions, is dissatisfied with the pace of replicant production at his company and sees the replicant child as a potential solution to his problem. He sends Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), his servant and a replicant herself, to find the child.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">K’s mission, given to him by Lieutenant Joshi, is to destroy the child. Joshi believes the separation between kinds must be maintained, and such a creature threatens that order. Eventually, this mission takes K to Rick Deckard, the former Blade Runner who left the force and ran away with Rachael 30 years ago. Now, he’s living alone in a Las Vegas high-rise. Ford is game as ever, unexpectedly touching but equipped with a powerful snarl. And cinematographer Roger Deakins, likely to receive his 14th Oscar nomination for this film, conjures some breathtaking images in the empty, orange-hued Las Vegas.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">As for Gosling, he’s good when the film lets him be, but his role is essentially that of a hot, brooding Pinocchio, and it can only sustain our interest for so long. The film takes familiar questions of humanity, inhumanity and the fine line between the two as its thematic focus, and, though thought-provoking, it has little new to say and never feels as profoundly alive as the original “Blade Runner” still does.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Blade Runner 2049,” clocking in at a hefty two hours and 43 minutes, ultimately comes off as a one hundred minute movie s</span><span class="s1">tretched beyond its means and turned into a turgid pseudo-epic. What could have been a spare, thoughtful film is instead a ponderous, philosophizing and fitfully-entertaining slog. As Villeneuve struggles to impart meaning and grandeur to his film, and the plot begins to pile up before him, it becomes clearer and clearer that “2049” just doesn’t have the electric, artful genius of “Blade Runner.” But then again, what does?</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wayland ’18.5: ‘American Made’ fitting title for peripheral, historical film</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/10/wayland-18-5-american-made-fitting-title-peripheral-historical-film/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“American Made” has a story to tell. It’s quite a story — so long as you don’t ask too many questions and you’re game to laugh your way through its gamboling plot.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The film stars Tom Cruise as Barry Seal, a Trans World Airlines pilot who becomes embroiled in the early stage drug war politics of the Iran-contra affair. Initially tapped by the CIA to run airborne reconnaissance over Central America, Seal quickly allows his business acumen — or greed, take your pick — to co-opt his patriotism. Before long, Seal finds himself entangled in a web spun by the Medellín cartel, the Nicaraguan Contras and even the White House.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The story is more than a little surreal, but “American Made” wants you to know that it is in on the joke. Director Doug Liman’s father, Arthur, served as chief counsel to the Senate in its investigation of the Iran-Contra Affair. Liman lived through the scandal, but he seems wholly uninterested in making the kind of conspiratorial thriller that has typically memorialized the post-Watergate era. It’s more “Wolf of Wall Street” than “Three Days of the Condor.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Buoyed by Cruise’s effervescent smile and charming roguishness, Liman’s protagonist offers an affable and wonky lens through which to view an otherwise serious and bloody international affair. Barry Seal moves between his various worlds like a clueless Danny Ocean, with the United States’ Central American interventions offering a profitable stage for his farcical caper.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“American Made” largely turns a blind eye to corruption when dealing with both the Colombian drug lords and intelligence bureaucrats. Indeed, the film appears more concerned with the trappings of wealth and hedonism than it is with political cynicism. Barry Seal makes such a wild profit running drugs and guns that he can’t launder the money flooding into his Arkansas home fast enough. He uses closets, drawers, backyard pits and even the entire vault in his town’s lone bank for storage, but even those are not enough. Once a symbol of his financial freedom and daring spirit, Seal’s money becomes a crushing weight, haunting him at every turn.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Otherwise, “American Made” asks you not to dig too deep. The film offers sparing details regarding the political nature of the scandal. When it indulges in history, it does so through Schoolhouse Rock-style animated vignettes backed by Cruise’s silly narration. Illegality offers a particularly productive site for comedy, as plane crashes caused by cocaine consumption and government drug raids receive an absurdist treatment when seen through Cruise’s permanently wide eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p3">“American Made” aims for laughs over serious reflection, but it also evokes nostalgia. Cinematographer César Charlone’s camera adopts a faded and grainy cinematic quality that feels like memory — unfocused, erratic and ephemeral. It suggests an era during which U.S clandestine operations were more ad hoc and campy and thus prone to individual ‘entrepreneurial’ exploits. It’s not dissimilar to the appeal of a Bond flick, minus the gadgets and Tory politicking. The lone man operating covertly on the world stage, particularly one that allows for reckless improvisation and self-governance, is a relic. It’s also an attractive relic for modern audiences. A more serious movie would have dispensed with such sentimentality and wish fulfillment. A more serious movie also wouldn’t have been as fun. When Cruise or Connery winks at you after cheating death once again, it’s an alluring reminder that life is just a game in the right hands. Aren’t moments like that the reason we go to <span class="s1">the movies? </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Pembroke field to be transformed into dance floor for annual event</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Saturday evening, after parents retire for the night, Pembroke Field will transform into a dance floor. This year, for the fourth time, A Night on College Hill — cosponsored by the Greek Council, the Student Activities Board and the Class Board — will bring a semi-formal dance party to campus. The event, which offers live music, a dessert bar and a photo booth, brings together students from all class years for a respite from Family Weekend activities.</p>
<p class="p2">The dance originally commemorated Brown’s 250th anniversary. It is free and open to all students with a Brown ID, each of which can bring a guest. ANOCH was an immediate hit four years ago and is quickly becoming one of the school’s most popular traditions. People have already been in touch with the Class Board, anxiously inquiring about whether ANOCH will be happening this year, said Dana Le ’18, Class Board senior co-president. This year, the event will feature KiwiiSour, a student band that recently played at Gigs on the Grass, as well as a DJ. “The quality of music that Brown students can produce … is amazing,” said Le.</p>
<p class="p2">ANOCH is “a really cool event to start the year” said Meghan Hershkowitz ’19. She attended the dance her freshman and sophomore years and plans to attend this weekend as well. She remembers getting ready with her friends for the event as a freshman. We “did the whole thing,” she said. “I think my favorite part is dressing up with all your friends,” she added. The guidelines for semi-formal dress are loose and students are encouraged to wear whatever feels comfortable to the event.</p>
<p class="p2">“We usually don’t have semi-formal events for the whole school,” Le said. The dance caters to “anyone that enjoys music.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ANOCH offers an opportunity to students who are not<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>involved in Greek Life to attend a dance, she added. The event is expected to attract more than 4,500 people this year, mostly undergraduate students. “It attracts people from all across Brown,” said Hershkowitz. At the event, students can meet people from their classes that they don’t know, she added. “There aren’t a lot of events on campus that bring the entire student body together,” said Jacquelyn Ingrassia ’19.</p>
<p class="p2">This Family Weekend, before winter descends, ANOCH will provide one of the few final opportunities to spend the night enjoying the weather outside. The dance is expected to bring thousands of underclassmen onto Pembroke Field, creating a unique chance to celebrate being a part of Brown’s campus.</p>
<p class="p2">ANOCH will take place Saturday evening between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Unseasonably warm weather and a tightly-packed schedule featuring sports, theater, food and more will greet families visiting Providence this weekend.</p>
<p class="p1">Family Weekend provides an occasion for students to spend time with their families and an opportunity for the student body as a whole to take a much-needed break from the relentless pace of midterm season.</p>
<p class="p2">Though it is unclear when the very first Family Weekend occurred, a previous edition of The Herald published Dec. 5, 1952 reported that Joseph Thomas of the 1954 Class Council “suggested that the class project be some sort of parent’s day with the purpose of giving fathers and mothers of undergraduates the opportunity to become better acquainted with Brown.” For the next five decades, Family Weekend has been a staple of each academic year.</p>
<p class="p2">The tradition kicked off under the name “Freshman Parents Day” and was reserved for freshman “parents and their sons,” according to an issue of The Herald published Oct. 24, 1963. The day revolved around a luncheon, a football game against the University of Rhode Island and a series of seminars discussing humanities, social sciences, science, mathematics and engineering, according to the Oct. 24, 1963 issue.</p>
<p class="p2">Freshman Parents Day expanded to a weekend for sophomore and junior parents in 1972. “We are planning a total weekend — panels, art, sports — that will appeal to the majority of parents and students with all kinds of tastes,” said Development Officer Jack Mastroianni , according to an edition of The Herald published March 20, 1972.</p>
<p class="p2">But 1972’s iteration of Family Weekend would not go smoothly, as pacifist and anti-war movements inspired students from all backgrounds to stage a massive anti-Vietnam War protest. A day before 1972’s April Parents Weekend, “one quarter of the Brown student body voted … for a ‘cessation and transformation’ of normal University activities,” according to a Herald article published April 21, 1972.</p>
<p class="p2">The war protests extended to Parents’ Weekend, where “parents (had) chances to question students about recent campus anti-war activity,” according to The Herald published the next day. “Students sometimes mistakenly assume that the great unwashed need to come on the campus to consider the war, when, in fact, it is not a new subject to most parents,” Robert Reichley, then the associate vice-president for university relations, told The Herald at the time.</p>
<p class="p2">But not every year can be as dramatic as 1972. 1973’s light-hearted crisis comprised pranksters putting up posters around campus advertising a made-up lecture titled “‘A Humanistic Approach to Oralgenital Relations,’ (which) was to be offered at 11 a.m. in Wilson 108 by Rev. William R. Coffin of Swarthmore Divinity School,” according to an article in The Herald published October 16 1973. When 20 first-year parents and a large number of undergraduates attempted to attend the lecture, they found that Wilson 108 could hold only about six people and the room was being “occupied by a football coach going over his plays with his backfield,” according to the article. It was later revealed that not only did William R. Coffin not exist, but Swarthmore College did not have a divinity school. After the posters were rapidly brought down by administrators, they “reappeared almost as rapidly,” according to the article.</p>
<p class="p2">In 1974, the great Parents’ Weekend fiasco boiled down to a production mishap, when the Brownbrokers, a student-run theatre group, had to cancel a student-written musical they had prepared for the parents.</p>
<p class="p2">“Though the Brownbrokers have produced original student musicals since 1953, the script selected for production this spring, Georg S, was cancelled when there were only 20 auditions for 24 roles,” wrote Steve Root in The Herald published April 24 1974.</p>
<p class="p2">Throughout the decades, Parents’ Weekend has unfailingly stood for three things: football games, musical and theatrical entertainment provided by various student groups and free food. So, as the weekend rolls around and the mean age on campus jumps up dramatically, students can kick back, throw midterm-related caution to the wind and enjoy a nice meal that doesn’t come out of a to-go box.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Shakespeare on the Green presents ‘Macbeth’</title>

<p class="p3">For their fall play this year, Shakespeare on the Green will present a rendition of Shakespeare’s famous “Macbeth.” Though the play retains its original dialogue, this performance will include a more modern twist seen through a unique lens.</p>
<p class="p4">“We’ve set it during the McCarthy era,” said Noelle Austin ’18, the show’s assistant director. “There are a lot of themes about appearance and maintaining the personal and public persona, themes of anxiety and claustrophobia. … These themes are very enduring across eras; what’s relevant in Shakespeare’s time is relevant when you get to communism, … the ’50s and the American mindset all the way to today.”</p>
<p class="p4">The play focuses on Macbeth’s choices and the reasoning behind them, said Grant MacFaddin ’19, director of the play. “Usually (he’s) touted as … ambitious and he has this tragic downfall, but what we want to do is take that a bit further; why does Macbeth feel like he has to be ambitious, why does he feel like this is something that somebody in his position should do?”</p>
<p class="p4">“The play is heavily implicated in themes of gender, power and self-awareness,” said Emma Radmilovic ’18, the play’s executive producer. “Our ‘Macbeth’ translates these themes metaphorically and physically onto the stage, using interpretive moments to depict a world that is slightly outside of reality.”</p>
<p class="p4">Though Shakespeare on the Green stages a fall production every year, it does not always fall on Family Weekend. But the director chooses the timing of the production, and putting on the show during Family Weekend allows parents to watch their kids act while avoiding cold winter weather, MacFaddin said. “It makes it a better experience for everybody.”</p>
<p class="p4">As a student-run group, Shakespeare on the Green has been putting on shows since 1997. “Shakespeare on the Green came along to fill the niches that weren’t being served,” MacFaddin said. “It filled that void of Shakespeare on campus and also site-specific theater.” The group also offers a shorter time commitment to those who cannot devote as much time to theater, opening up the plays to more students.</p>
<p class="p4">“We have always been committed to being an inclusive and safe environment for all students,” Radmilovic said. “We have had the joy of seeing our community grow significantly in the last four years to become a thriving theater community.”</p>
<p class="p4">In the performance, audience members can expect an in-depth experience. “The show has a lot of movement,” Austin said. “The choreography has some tango, it has some contemporary, it has some fun modern movement.”</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s a very intimate performance,” said MacFaddin. “It’s a relatively small audience, and it’s a pretty tight space so a lot of people can expect to get up close and personal with the experience of the performance.”</p>
<p class="p4">The show is set to take place in Lot 29, located at 8 Fones Alley, Friday, Oct. 13, at 7 p.m.; Saturday, Oct. 14, at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. and Sunday, Oct. 15, at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Tickets are free for the public and can be obtained on the Shakespeare on the Green Facebook page or at the door. In the case of inclement weather, the production’s rain site will be posted on its Facebook event page.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Dynamic, effusive and vibrant, watercolorist Keren Kroul’s exhibition “Topographies of Wonder” first made its home at Granoff Center for the Creative Arts last Thursday. The exhibition is one of a lucky select few chosen from nearly 300 submissions to be housed in the Atrium and Cohen Galleries for the Brown Arts Initiative’s inaugural 2017-18 season, said Program Manager Sophia LaCava-Bohanan. After the Initiative issued an open call nationwide for exhibitions last December, the review committee unanimously decided to include Kroul’s show, LaCava-Bohanan added. “Everyone came to the table with Keren as one of their top choices.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For those visiting the exhibit, it’s not difficult to see why “Topographies of Wonder” survived the scrutiny of the committee. Upon first glance, the viewer experiences a visceral reaction to the four paneled works on display. The vibrant color palettes — each a mosaic of warm and cool tones — are intensified by the works’ massive scale, evoking sensations of playful joy in the audience.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For some, the exhibition may be reminiscent of the giant, geometric, now-ubiquitous murals that Keith Haring painted around the world in the ’80s. But rather than painting the side of a building that pedestrians will simply pass by, Kroul paints watercolors on paper for gallery walls that demand a scrupulous eye for detail from its viewers. She said she hopes for audiences to experience the dichotomy of space, between close and far, just as she does while painting the pieces. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“When I work on these pieces, physically, I’m standing really, really close; I’m working with tiny brushes, and it’s all watercolor,” Kroul said. “To really see it, I have to step back. So there’s this constant push-and-pull.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kroul’s art is the logical fruition of her remarkably colorful and global life. Born in Israel and of Israeli and Argentinian descent, the artist lived in Israel, Mexico and later Costa Rica before attending college in the United States, where she has resided since. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With its seemingly infinite amount of smaller shapes that create a coherent whole, “Topographies of Wonder” takes on the story of Kroul’s unique, kaleidoscopic identity that comes from the multiculturalism and multilingualism of her upbringing, where she switched between English, Spanish and Hebrew to effectively communicate with her family. “I grew up always feeling like wherever I was, I really wasn’t from there,” Kroul said. “So when I started making this work, I was very consciously thinking about … how I’m always trying to (bring) together all these different parts of who I think I am into one.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This theme of unity composed of disparate pieces echoes the goal of the arts initiative, which aims to invite various groups to view “Topographies of Wonder” and the other exhibits it has planned. While the initiative primarily exists to benefit students through an engagement with the arts, Managing Director Anne Bergeron said she desires to see its audience expand beyond the University and act as a cultural resource for anyone to use. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“For the first time we are being very intentional about reaching out and letting the campus and local community know when these exhibitions are on view,” she said. Bergeron and LaCava-Bohanan agree that the change has already begun to take place, as LaCava-Bohanan said she has “seen so many community members walk in and just see the work.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While “Topographies of Wonder” might appear sufficiently pleasing at a distance, viewers should move up close to unearth the meticulous detail produced by the hand of the artist. “Topographies of Wonder” is on view until Nov. 5 at the Atrium Gallery.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As Assistant Professor of Music Wang Lu’s composition trickles into the 200-seat Martinos auditorium, the space becomes intimate and personal. As if by magic, Wang fills the room with raw and emotive sounds that hypnotizes the audience.</p>
<p class="p2">Sunday night in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts, the Brown Arts Initiative presented “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous,” a collaboration between poet Ocean Vuong and Wang. The show included live poetry readings by Vuong and four pieces composed by Wang and performed by guitarist Dan Lippel and saxophone player Ryan Muncy.</p>
<p class="p2">Wang took part in a six-week residency with Vuong this past summer, where she first came into contact with his poetry. During the residency, she was able to get to know Vuong and his work. Wang carried Vuong’s poetry book as she spent the summer traveling around the West Coast and China.</p>
<p class="p2">Vuong, an immigrant born into a family of rice farmers in Vietnam, used to sleep in New York’s Penn Station before he became an established poet. He encountered the challenges of owning his queer identity in a conservative culture.</p>
<p class="p2">Aspects of his story resonated with Wang. She also found inspiration in his expressive use of language. “You can see the flash of this person,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">The name for the show, “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous” comes from one of Vuong’s poems. “It’s a beautiful title,” Wang said. Her compositions, which remain unnamed, do not always respond to specific poems but rather to Vuong’s mastery of language, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">The compositions included in the show are works in progress, she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wang had not determined every aspect of the pieces and hoped to leave space for Lippel and Muncy to play with her composition. “They are not just interpreters,” she said of the musicians. “They are composers.”</p>
<p class="p2">Last year, she composed a dual piece called “Ryan and Dan” for the musicians to perform, and the pair premiered it at the University. This piece focuses on the relationship between the two people and nature, she said. It has to do with, “playing for the one who understands you,” Wang said, and fit well with the rest of the pieces in the event. “Ryan and Dan” was included in the middle of Sunday’s show, along with her more recent works that responded to Vuong’s poetry. “(Lippel and Muncy) are very busy, stellar, touring musicians” and finding the time for all four artists to work together provided a bit of a challenge, Wang said. Lippel and Vuong did not meet in person until the day of the show.</p>
<p class="p2">“The poetry and the music are both very sensual and very…textural,” Lippel said. “Ryan and I are playing a lot of sounds that you can almost … feel on your skin,” he added. The evocative music mimicked Vuong’s poetry in these very tangible expressions, Lippel said. The compositions emphasized a sense of honesty accessible to all listeners instead <span class="s1">of a more scholarly structure, Wang said. The synthesis of the two art forms, defined by poignant expressions and authentic spontaneity, came together in a powerful Sunday evening.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Pardlo’s poetry ties together multi-faceted identities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Gregory Pardlo performed a reading of his work at the McCormack Family Theater on Thursday as part of the literary arts department’s “Writers on Writing” <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/literary-arts/events">series</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pardlo’s collection “Digest” won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize when he was a doctoral candidate at the City University of New <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jesse-kornbluth/when-greg-pardlo-won-the_b_8636834.html">York</a>. “Totem,” his first collection, was selected in 2007 by Brenda Hillman for the American Poetry Review/Honickman First Book <a href="http://aprweb.org/news/2015/05/01/gregory-pardlo-wins-pulitzer-prize">Prize</a>. He is also the recipient of several other honors, including fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts. Currently, he is the Poetry Editor of the Virginia Quarterly Review. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pardlo’s poetry ties in cultural references, discussing history and philosophy and weaving those themes into the intimate details of the everyday. As he began his reading, Pardlo challenged the audience to think about the “growing layers” in the pieces he selected. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Between readings, he brought up a famous quote from “Song of Myself” by Walt Whitman. “I contain multitudes,” he said, referencing how the poem highlights the complexity of the seemingly benign. In his work, he argues that readers need not look far to access a rich variety of inspiration. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“All the references I make are ones that are readily available in our culture,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tries “not to buy into the false distinctions” between types of discourse, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The idea resounded with members of the audience as well.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“He manages to make us know that there is not this break in different discourses; in fact, discourse is a continuum,” said Cole Swensen, professor and current chair of the literary arts department. Pardlo has an ability to bring together a vast range of ideas and thoughts in his poetry, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Swensen, the literary arts department chose to showcase Pardlo’s poetry for its impressive scope. “I knew that he would represent a wide range of voices, a wide range of possibilities in poetry, while also being accessible,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By choosing this particular poet, the literary arts department aimed to reach a broad audience. Swensen emphasized that attendance to the reading was not limited to the two undergraduate courses studying Pardlo’s poetry. “We love it when people come from other disciplines and other departments,” she said. “One of the things we (at the literary arts department) like to do is to blend communities,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Karis Ryu ’21, a student in the “Writers on Writing” seminar, noted the personal significance of Pardlo’s poetry. Pardlo’s work resonated with her, as she identified “as somebody who has dealt with having multiple labels throughout (her) life,” she said. “To see somebody who can balance all of that, and is in academia, is really inspiring,” she said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Meyerowitz Stories’ makes for bittersweet family comedy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Parents raise us and then they haunt us. Sometimes it turns out alright — we live up to our parents’ expectations, or they learn to adjust them. But sometimes the tension between the adult a parent imagines and the adult the child becomes never goes away.</p>
<p class="p4">In “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),” that tension is painfully present. Directed by Noah Baumbach, whose work often deals with the white American intelligentsia, the Netflix original film focuses on three adult siblings and their troubled relationship with their father, the sculptor and former college professor Harold Meyerowitz, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman.</p>
<p class="p4">Like many of Baumbach’s films, “The Meyerowitz Stories” wears its cheeky erudition on its sleeve, and makes plain its literary aspirations. The film is divided into chapters, announced via title cards that bear Franzen-esque introductory sentences.</p>
<p class="p4">The first chapter centers on the eldest son, Danny (Adam Sandler)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a “house husband” and failed musician. Coming out of a divorce and with a daughter going off to college, Danny is living with his father and wonderfully tipsy step-mother, Maureen (Emma Thompson) in their Manhattan apartment.</p>
<p class="p4">The fact that Sandler can act isn’t news, but it is easy to forget. In “The Meyerowitz Stories,” he issues a clarion reminder. That this is the film in which he does so, though, is surprising — there’s something strange, for instance, about seeing Sandler attend an opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Nevertheless, he turns in a loose, funny performance as Danny, softening his normal man-child persona into something sadder and more real.</p>
<p class="p4">To his father, Danny is a disappointment. But so are all of Harold’s children to varying degrees. Born to different women and leading different lives, none of them are close. His younger son, Matthew (Ben Stiller) is on edge as a wealthy business manager in Los Angeles, and his daughter, Jean (Elizabeth Marvel), perfectly dry, works at Xerox in Rochester. They have respectable lives, but to Harold’s dismay, none of them are artists.</p>
<p class="p4">Spend one minute with Harold Meyerowitz and you’ll know he’s an artist — not because he scowls and smokes American Spirit cigarettes by the pack, but because he’ll tell you. In fact, that’s probably all he’ll talk about. Harold sounds as though he learned to speak by reading back issues of the Oxford Art Journal, and he often turns his scholarly assessments inward, offering astute observations of his own work to no one in particular. But his behavior masks the fragile ego of a man who never found the success and celebrity he wanted in life. Now in his 70s and staring down the barrel of obscurity, his most exciting prospect is being featured in a group show at Bard College where he has taught for decades.</p>
<p class="p4">As Harold, Hoffman offers a tragicomic tour de force of a performance. Hilariously passive-aggressive at first, Hoffman gradually reveals the man’s delusions and humiliations, shifting Harold back and forth between being the film’s most frustrating character and its most affecting.</p>
<p class="p4">His children know this seesaw well. When Harold eventually lands in the hospital, they all travel to see him. Daniel and Matthew have an especially hard time managing their feelings — it’s hard to be angry at a bedridden old man, even if he<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>wasn’t a great father. They ask their sister Jean why she always shows up for Harold. She replies, “because I’m a decent person.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s a simple but stinging rebuke,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in line with the torturous moral reasoning and introspection that Baumbach is a master of conveying. But one does get the sense that Baumbach is trying to have his cake and eat it too, using his female character to call out the two brothers on their egotism and masculine posturing even as he indulges that very behavior. The film cements this perception when, later on, a fight between Danny and Matthew turns into a wrestling match. Grown men tussling has to clear a high bar of dramatic motive to be worth putting on screen, and the bar knocks Baumbach squarely in the shins this time around.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Baumbach also exhibits an occasional tendency to overwrite, aiming and largely failing to achieve a heightened, anxious poetry in his dialogue. Most of the time, though, the writing is as funny and touchingly human as his best work.</p>
<p class="p4">Baumbach remains a smart cinematic craftsman. The character dynamics of a scene play out in the camera movement — he often tracks his characters as they walk away from and toward each other, letting one actor pull the frame along until the others catch up and assert their own dominance over the image. And as he proved in his 2015 feature “Mistress America,” Baumbach and editor Jennifer Lame have an irreverent visual style that yields hysterical and poignant results.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Perhaps the great hope of the film, and the family, is the relationship between Danny and his daughter Eliza (Grace Van Patten). She is an intelligent, creative young woman, a freshman at Bard and an aspiring filmmaker; it seems Danny has managed to avoid the parenting mistakes of his father. Something tells us he’ll be a good ghost.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Global Americana showcases New World discoveries in age of exploration</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On Saturday morning, the John Carter Brown Library held an exhibition and a faculty-led panel on Latin American colonial history. The artifacts exhibited part of the “Global Americana” collection, a series of works written about innovations, discoveries and observations made about the New World during the age of exploration. Library staff hoped that families would understand the various resources accessible to their students through the lecture, said Neil Safier, director of the JCB.</p>
<p class="p2">Prior to the gallery opening, the library hosted a panel featuring Assistant Professor of Archaeology and the Ancient World Felipe Rojas Silva, Associate Professor of History Robert Cope and Assistant Professor of History Emily Owens. They discussed the value and limitations of historical artifacts and writings for evaluating histories, focusing on the professors’ experiences with their undergraduate classes.</p>
<p class="p2">Owens, in particular, expressed her appreciation for primary sources. They force her students to think about and determine the voice and audience of a piece of writing and how those factors affect its message, she said. The goal of her first-year seminar was not to teach history but how to “think like a historian,” Owens added.</p>
<p class="p2">Rojas Silva was more wary in his assessment of the value of primary sources. He claimed that even artifacts dating back hundreds of years could be forged, though counterfeits themselves could offer a perspective about cultural values of the time. Especially in a setting of discovery and exploration, timelines and points of view can be inconsistent and hard to follow, Cope added.</p>
<p class="p2">After the panel, students and parents were invited to explore the collection, which included a variety of maps, books and charts representing the cross-cultural understandings and colonial experiences of the time. Among the works present were a table of death records, a counterfeit Galileo and a small book that supposedly belonged to a child studying early colonial history a century ago.</p>
<p class="p2">In one short passage, the captain Francisco Xavier Ribeiro Sampaio described his first experiences seeing, touching and tasting pineapple, which was the “most beautiful fruit I have seen in all the world … beauty of aspect, sweetness of scent, excellent taste,” as he described in a travel journal. Other indigenous foods described included the potato, the cacao bean and vanilla.</p>
<p class="p2">The exhibition also featured meticulously documented medical techniques of the era. This included a diagram of an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>intestinal tract surgery, which is presumed to be the first anatomical engraving in America.</p>
<p class="p2">Perhaps the most representative of the sociological dynamics of the era was “A Letter to Philo Africanus upon slavery,” a letter by Candidus arguing for the continuation of slavery and its benefits. Written at the time of Somerset v. Stewart, a landmark case in the abolitionist movement that ruled that chattel slavery could not be supported by English common law, the letter sought to repair the foundation of slavery after it was shaken by the controversial ruling. This, among other pieces that mention integration of Western and European cultures — such as a Portuguese play about exploration that featured the Tupi language — are physical evidence of the Americas’ complicated and diverse past.</p>
<p class="p2">The exhibit and panel was attended by students and their parents during Family Weekend. Diana Thompson, a family member visiting for the weekend, said that the pieces regarding medicine and the environment interested her most, and she appreciated that the University provides students with access to such articles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The n</span><span class="s4">ippy air last Thursday night marked the arrival of autumn in Providence, yet audience members in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts’ Martinos Auditorium didn’t seem to care as they soaked in the warm sounds of the music group Pa’lo Monte. The 11-person ensemble demonstrated their performative prowess during the 90-minute concert, incorporating pieces heavily influenced by Afro-Dominican and Haitian rhythm and drums<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the sounds of the electrical guitar, saxophone and keyboard for a distinctive fusion of styles. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The audience loosened up throughout the course of the night. People started by swaying in their seats before a growing number rose to dance on the sides of the auditorium in clusters. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“This is something that I grew up listening to,” said Ana Marx ’18.5, who lived in Cuba for several years. “It’s difficult to not move. …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(The music) compels you out of your seat.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Most of the group’s members hail from the Dominican Republic or Haiti, but now live and work in New York or Los Angeles, said Marlene Mercedes, a producer, vocalist and percussionist in the group. Beginning as a production society and later developing into a teaching and performance group, Pa’lo Monte has championed social activism since its inception, Mercedes said. During the performance, the performers were also in flux, constantly exchanging instruments and entering and exiting the stage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The concert had been accompanied by a workshop earlier that day, in which Osvaldo Sánchez, Pa’lo Monte’s founder and director, taught attendees about the history of the Dominican Republic before inviting them on stage to dance to the Palo and Congo genres of music, said Assistant Professor of Music Joshua Tucker, co-organizer of the event. The group is the first of three Latin American musical groups invited this year by the Department of Music and the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies to stage performances, workshops and public talks, said Jessaca Leinaweaver, director of CLACS, professor of anthropology and a co-organizer of the event. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“We’ve had a number of Latin American musical events in the last few years, but they seemed kind of confined to a narrow slice of Latin American music,” Tucker added. “We wanted to broaden that … and get people exposed to the incredible variety of music that there is in Latin America.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Leinaweaver also cited the CLACS’ desire to provide an inclusive cultural outlet, which meant consciously selecting performers that represent local Colombian and Dominican communities, two of the largest Latin American groups in Rhode Island, she said. The organizers promoted the Pa’lo Monte events by hanging up posters on Broad Street and in various spaces </span><span class="s3">at Brown, she added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>PW’s ‘Melancholy Play’ reframes reflective sadness</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Melancholy Play: A Contemporary Farce,” Production Workshop’s new play, is anything but what its name implies. With humorous one-liners, unique twists and a surprising number of references to almonds, the play is hilariously loud and fun. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Directed by Shade Au ’19, “Melancholy Play” was originally written by playwright Sarah Ruhl. The show is centered around Tilly (Tara Sharma ’20), a bold and unashamed woman whose<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>friends fall in love with her and her melancholy throughout the play. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The play strives to demonstrate that “melancholy is reflective; it is a mood” rather than a characteristic or description, Au said. “It took a lot of work to reframe melancholy as something that is about human connection and … allows others to empathize with each other,” he added. The show succeeds in showing the beauty in the main character’s sad and wistful take on life. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the most defining moments in the play is when Frank, Tilly’s friend, asks her, “Are you happier now?” to which she replies “Yes, I think so.” This exchange highlights the turning point in the play when Tilly begins to feel happy, and — surprisingly — where the problems begin. Her friends start to feel differently about her. “The problem is that when Tilly becomes happy, she stops listening to her friends,” said Au. This is illustrated when Frank pleads with her, “Can you even see me?” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> One couch, two chairs and two mobile frames are all that comprised the minimalist set. As Au directed the show, he was “thinking about showing the downspace as what it is, which is … an empty room, and showing that you can still make theater in just that,” he said. The frames served as windows, doors and invisible walls, which tie together the two worlds. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Possibly one of the most distinctive features of the show was the background wall that featured the titles of each scene, such as “Tilly asks Frank why is he like an almond,” “By the bedside of Frances the almond” and “Joan reveals a terrible secret to Tilly.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With each character wearing a different colored shirt, each personality was visibly individualized. Each costume also had accessories such as aprons or pockets that were stitched on the costumes to reflect each character’s profession , such as a bank teller or hair dresser, Au said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The tone of the play was kept simple but significant with Julian Gau ’19 playing all the background music on a cello. At one point, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>characters broke the fourth wall and acknowledged the cellist and his music, asking him to play happier tunes. Gau told the actors, “It’s a little difficult on a cello.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">An ineffably talented posse is sweeping the University’s and Providence’s rap arenas: the formidable musical collective DIASPØRA. Collated from an array of artistic disciplines, the group’s nine members coalesce behind an undying commitment to music. Like the term from which the group derives its name<span class="s3">, DIASPØRA reconciles the grand dispersion of its individual parts with deeply-rooted creative origins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Enter the nine chambers</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The group’s membership includes Dustin “KNOHISRY” Abadie ’18, Antone “TONE” LeBlanc ’18, Nadir “PonyboyPearson” Pearson ’19, Sanoj “Bondyé DJAB” Allen ’18, Saleka “Saleka Night” Shyamalan ’18, Javon “SO4P” Stephenson ’18, Tim Taliaferro ’18, Mohamed Mohamed ’18 and Felege Gebru ’17. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“The reason that DIASPØRA works so well is that everyone does a bit of everything. We all play an essential role in each project that comes out,” Stephenson said, emphasizing each member’s idiosyncratic artistry, including his own expertise in acting. “Saleka sings and plays classical piano, Felege does graphic design and Nadir handles our branding, management and cinematography,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In a similar respect, the collective maintains a broad array of academic interests, which merge to uniformly complement their musical production. For some members, music is their explicit academic focus, as evidenced by Abadie’s concentration in music production. Others study subjects more loosely — but still vitally — related to DIASPØRA’s output. Tali, for example, is pursuing an A.B. in engineering — a concentration that cultivates his overarching interest in making things, music production included. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“The most important thing is that, as a group, we’re able to compensate for gaps in each other’s networks or artistic talents,” said LeBlanc, fresh off the release of his solo EP, “Nothing in Return.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>PVD state of mind </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Our sophomore summer, (Dustin) and I lived in a house together in Providence. We took a visual arts class while Antone worked as an RA,” Stephenson said, detailing the group’s formation over summer 2016. “We just worked non-stop on music and ultimately made our first big track, ‘Sailor Moon’ — a song mastered and recorded by InHouse Studios here in Providence,” a studio that has recorded artists ranging from D. Valor to The Funk Underground.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“It’s hard to come by young people as motivated as DIASPØRA,” said InHouse Studios proprietor Alex “Taki” Mazz. “The talent oozing from their individual and collective brain(s) is apparent upon first meet. I’m excited to see their growth continue.” </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“That summer really got things started for DIASPØRA,” LeBlanc said. “It just consisted of … meeting local musicians and playing with them,” referencing musicians like InHouse’s KelKeyz.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Homecoming</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Since their fateful formation, the group has made waves across innumerable Providence venues, dropping forceful bars and enthralling beats throughout the Ocean State’s spaces most recognized for music. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Because of how small and tight-knit Providence is, we’ve had the chance to play at all the big venues,” LeBlanc said, including Aurora, The Met, AS220, Fete and Colosseum. “At this point, we’re fortunate enough to have people just reach out to us when they want us to play a show.” </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“We even got to open for Denzel Curry,” LeBlanc added, alluding to the renowned rapper’s September 2016 show at The Met. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">But even in light of this widespread success, DIASPØRA remains committed to playing music at Brown. This October, the group performed at “Gigs on the Grass” on Wriston. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“We’ve also gotten to do shows at Pembroke Field, Sayles Hall and </span><span class="s4">Faunce’s Leung Gallery,” Abadie said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">Some University professors have also taken interest in the group, including Colin Channer, assistant professor of literary arts. Channer “is a great writer and has served as a mentor for taking my writing even deeper,” LeBlanc said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">The group embeds itself into the University’s emerging tradition of successful hip-hop artists, joining recent graduates Eric Axelman ’13 (of The Funk Underground) and Dolapo “DAP The Contract” Akinkugbe ’16. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">“DAP served as a mentor for DIASPØRA’s members,” Stephenson said. “Our time at Brown overlapped by two years, so he was crucial in integrating us in the scene here.” </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">“As for future plans, we just always have new projects on the horizon,” Stephenson said. “But I know Sanoj is making like two beats a day and</span> that Saleka has something huge coming up. We’re just all most comfortable when we’re pursuing an artistic mindset.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Skeleton Crew’ shows struggles of American family</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This past Saturday, Trinity Repertory Company’s production of the off-Broadway comedy-drama “Skeleton Crew” captivated audiences with a profound, clever and freshly contemporary take on the ever-elusive “American Dream.” Written by Dominique Morisseau, a playwright lauded for her intimate renderings of the lives of the American working class, “Skeleton Crew” follows the rough-and-tumble workdays of a makeshift family of Detroit auto workers during the Great Recession.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The performance begins with a dark stage. Strobe lights flash, intense industrial techno beats start to pound and actors, wearing reflective construction vests, run out from behind the double doors and begin dancing to the sounds of scraping metal; the seriousness and specificity of their movements signify the rigorous technicality of their work. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The music fades and the stage lights flick on. In struts Shanita (Shenyse Harris ’18), fiercely pretty and pregnant. After setting down her purse, she checks the mini-fridge and, disappointed, snaps, “Who’s been touching my salad dressing again?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Co-producer of Showtime’s popular working class comedy-drama “Shameless,” Morisseau is a pro at clever character-establishing banter, which reappears in “Skeleton Crew.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In response to Shanita’s caustic accusation, Faye, played by Lizan Mitchell, the dignified, cynical matriarch of the plant family, snaps back with a sharp remark that incriminates Dez, played by Will Adams ’19, the macho, sexually frustrated scapegoat of everyone’s jokes. Reggie, portrayed by Jude Sandy ’05 MA’09, the tie-wearing plant supervisor, calmly reprimands Faye for smoking indoors for the thousandth time. As he is a close family friend of Faye’s, Reggie’s disciplinary efforts are largely in vain. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The action takes place in a workers’ break room: the set features a cheap couch, a mini-fridge, a microwave, a half-empty pot of coffee and a bulletin board with a sign that reads “Unit Meeting Thursday.” From the cardboard Bankers Boxes to the tacky, middle-school gymnasium-esque wall tiling, no detail is spared. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Within the first 30 minutes, the plot takes the expected dramatic turn. The plant is going to be shut down within the year. Reggie confides this in Faye, swearing her to secrecy, and Faye spends the first act torn between her loyalty to Reggie, her sort-of-godson and supervisor, and her sense of duty to Shanita and Dez, whose dreams are hanging in the balance. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Morisseau manages to again create characters who remain complex and avoid becoming carictatures — despite certain shortcomings and tropes apparent in Adams’ portrayal of Dez — while still clearly working to represent broader social issues.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Each character is struggling with their own “bag of shit.” Having lost her house to the bank, Faye is secretly sleeping on the rec room couch. Dez wants to start a repair shop but can’t come up with the cash. Shanita is grappling with the prospect of raising a child on her own. Hoping to provide a better life for his wife and kids, Reggie struggles with his desire to maintain his blue-collar roots while working in a managerial position. Morisseau’s script thus gives the viewer an immediate sense of the intimacy and tension that makes these co-workers a family. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To bridge critical parts of the play, actors — keepers of America’s “skeleton” — engage in symbolic dances representative of the demanding technicality of their labor as auto-plant workers — a clever way to represent industrial work within the confines of the stage. They provide a welcome change of pace from the play’s otherwise measured, dialogue-weighted cadence.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>St. Vincent’s fifth album combines anxiety, chaos</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Annie Clark is making a statement. If it was not clear from the eye-catching album art or all-caps titling of “MASSEDUCTION,” Annie Clark’s anxiety-wrought fifth album as St. Vincent says everything it wants to say in a taut 41 minutes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The album’s first track, “Hang on Me,” forces the listener to do exactly that. “I know you’re probably sleeping,” St. Vincent sings in hushed tones in the opening line. The implication, of course, is that the listener is now awake — or, at least, is about to be.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">From there on out, the album gradually gains a chaotic momentum. “Pills,” the second track, possesses a caustic sing-song quality. Underneath the bubblegum pop, St. Vincent croons a tirade against the gain of pleasure through artifice. She is no less subtle in the titular “Masseduction.” “Don’t turn off what turns me on,” she sings, though there is a wryness in the song that conveys an urgency to do just that.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In between the high-energy, high-impact critiques of modernity, hedonism and superficiality are small moments for deep breaths. Both “Happy Birthday, Johnny” and “New York” show a fragile side that St. Vincent has not shared before, and create the sense that it’s more Clark than St. Vincent shining through. But the tenuous anxiety of the rest of the album persists in these ballads; something is bound to crack, and St. Vincent knows better than to humpty-dumpty the affair.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a brief return to ricocheting melodies, the penultimate track, “Slow Disco,” provides one last chance for the listener to breathe before sliding into the utterly breathless “Smoking Section.” Quite unlike any other song that Clark has put out as St. Vincent, “Smoking Section” sends out one final plea to “MASSEDUCTION” listeners. “It’s not the end,” she insists as the album fades out, and it’s hard not to believe her.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With “MASSEDUCTION,” Clark is demonstrating the most varied and vocally diverse work of her career. There’s a sense of world wariness and maturity that provides a gravitas to the album, and its raison d’être is the strongest of any St. Vincent album to date. It is topical without being on the nose, fierce, fun and gorgeous.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“MASSEDUCTION” was released Oct. 13 and is available on most streaming platforms. For those who want to see the seduction live, St. Vincent will be playing a show at the House of Blues in Boston Nov. 30. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Artist Nick Cave screens film, lectures on aesthetic choices</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nick Cave, a contemporary artist known for his wearable sculptures called Soundsuits, was the inaugural speaker for the Brown Arts Initiative’s Warren and Alison Kanders Lecture Series. His presentation saw a full house at the Martinos Theater in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts last Wednesday, when he was joined on stage by the curator of his last installation at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, Denise Markonish.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The presentation began with a 30-minute screening of Cave’s film, “Up Right: Detroit,” which offered an introduction into the type of sculptures and work that Cave has been doing with Soundsuits. As ambient, sententious music plays, the audience sees several ordinary Detroit citizens transform into colorful and opulently Soundsuit-adorned individuals, who exit an abandoned warehouse and make their way into the city. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lecture series is “designed to serve as a catalyst for open dialogue about the impact of contemporary art on our world,” said Butch Rovan, the faculty director of the Brown Arts Initiative, who was involved in planning the Kanders Lecture Series.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Up Right: Detroit is a short feature film conceived by Nick as an act of initiation and a preparation of the mind, body, spirit and selfhood,” Rovan said. “In the film, the participants undergo a metamorphosis by being costumed in Nick’s elaborate sound suits, re-entering the city transformed.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the screening, Cave and Markonish discussed Cave’s path into the art world, his creative process and the meaning behind the MASS MoCA installation called “Until,” which was an enormous and monumental warehouse that did not contain a single one of the Soundsuits that Cave is known for but rather attempted to simulate the experience of “stepping into the belly of a Soundsuit,” Markonish said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The most important thing is how do you create a show that can stand as a sort of installation by itself without any sort of performance activity whatsoever,” Cave said, adding that the next step is to consider how the space “open(s) itself up for performance intake.” Over the course of 10 months, approximately 10 performers used the space in which Cave’s exhibition was held as a stage for public debate and performances.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cave’s exhibition and previous work in Soundsuits ask questions of police brutality and social justice. “The work that he’s showing was … very topical. It’s very much geared towards a particularized sentiment based around police brutality and issues surrounding ongoing treatment of African Americans in society,” said Theodore Lau ’19.5, who attended the lecture. The Soundsuits were meant to make “the person entirely racially ambiguous, so that they could … exist in a post-racial sphere or bubble.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I really wanted to hear what he had to say about (his work), about his formulation, about his opinions on the issue (of police brutality), (and) how he was then thinking about articulating those into the show,” Lau said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Energy radiated from “setGO in Motion,” an improvisational dance performance put on by professional dancers and undergraduates and hosted by the Brown Arts Initiative and Fitt Artists Residence Friday night. Bodies moved independently and collectively across the black hardwood floor of the Ashamu dance studio. Footsteps, tambourine beats and jazzy piano notes reverberated through the room as gasps and laughs escaped from both audience members and performers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Students, faculty and community members packed into chairs and floor cushions to watch both students and setGO, an ensemble of professional dancers, perform. The performance was split into two parts. For the first 30 minutes, advanced modern dance students<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>performed. For the next 45 minutes, the five-person setGo ensemble performed Contact Improvisation. Both groups were accompanied by percussion, piano and vocals performed by musician Greg Woodside.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Performing members of the setGO ensemble included Shura Baryshnikov,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>teaching associate in the Department of Theatre Arts and Performances Studies, Aaron Brando, Sarah Konner, Bradley Teal Ellis and guest performer Gabriel Forestieri. The group, established under the name setGO in 2016, consists of “old friends that have been dancing together in a non-performative way” for about ten years, Konner said. In this performance, the ensemble decided to put energy toward “bringing our different forms of performance into one space for investigation,” Konner added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">SetGO in Motion marked the end of a week of improvisation workshops lead by setGO and other visiting performers. Nine classes were offered to undergraduate and MFA students along with events open to the wider Providence community. The classes revolved around questions of how to structure an improvised performance, as the workshops introduced many students were introduced to improvisation for the first time, Baryshnikov said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s a very slow and methodical process of bringing a group of dancers together and gaining … trust,” Baryshnikov said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Konner described Contact Improvisation as a partner dance form created by dancer Steve Paxton in the 1970s. This dance method has grown and diverged into many different forms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For Aaron Brando, this art form relates to “a tuning of my awareness (when) moving within a space.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Improvisation is a huge spectrum,” Konner said. Even in choreographed dance, dancers must make conscious decisions, such as where their eyes should fall. On the other end of the spectrum, dancers are given full agency over their bodies within a designated space and time, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The setGO ensemble decided in this performance to focus on “deconstructing space” and “demystifying the process a bit for the dance audience,” Brando said. “Improvisation can be challenging to watch,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the first performance, the audience carefully watched undergraduates move across the room. Later, as setGo performed, the ensemble moved fluidly together and in smaller groups to the beat of Woodside’s music, which changed tempo and mood frequently. Dancers lifted each other into the air unexpectedly, balanced on limbs, and sank into to the ground. At times, a performer was called to report to the audience their emotions or what they were noticing in that frozen moment. In a conversation with the audience after the performance, the setGo ensemble explained that this call was one they used to clarify their process.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The ensemble’s performance ended with all five dancers gathered around Woodside’s piano, their limbs and torsos close together, bodies and music intertwining. Brando grabbed Woodside’s sheet music in his teeth as the music escalated. The eyes of audience members, including the undergraduates who had danced before them, remained glued to the ensemble until the music stopped and the lights went up.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Following the performance, as dancers took in gulps of air and water, audience member Poom Pipatjarasgit ’21 said, “I found the performance to be very interesting, free-flowing and organic.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Poet Elizabeth Willis celebrates C.D. Wright</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The large photograph of poet and Professor of Literary Arts Carolyn “C.D.” Wright on the projector screen stood as a symbol to the grand impact of her writing as it was emphasized by esteemed poet Elizabeth Willis’ lecture on Oct. 18. The speech served to inaugurate the C.D. Wright Lecture Series, which, according to Literary Arts Professor Cole Swenson, aims to “honor the memory of our deeply valued colleague C.D. Wright, who died in 2016, and to perpetuate the study and circulation of her work.”</p>
<p class="p2">Wright was born and raised in Arkansas and was the Israel J. Kapstein Professor of English and Professor of Literary Arts at Brown. Her honors include the National Book Critics Circle award for her book “One With Others,” a MacArthur Fellowship and a membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p class="p2">Invited by the Literary Arts Department to speak on the impact of Wright’s work, Willis discussed Wright’s style of writing and the important influences in her work.</p>
<p class="p2">“Willis is a prominent critic who knew C.D.’s work extremely well, and is also, herself, a well-known and excellent poet. We knew that she would write a talk that was inventive, dynamic and in every way worthy of C.D. and her work,” Swenson wrote in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p2">Appropriately opening the lecture, Willis discussed the concepts of beginnings and endings, both in life and in Wright’s work. She drew attention to the question of nativity in Wright’s writing and her practice of “tracing the branch back to the root.”</p>
<p class="p2">Willis extended this idea of beginnings by accentuating how Wright’s upbringing as a daughter of a court reporter and judge piqued her fascination with the law. She said that Wright is a “poet of the dictionary, and of the law and of the book.” She referenced Walt Whitman’s poem “Respondez!” from his 1855 collection “Leaves of Grass”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to elaborate on how Wright’s work has the ability to talk back to power and advocate for a kind of disobedience.</p>
<p class="p2">Another idea Willis evoked was the performativity of Wright’s language. “What the poet does best is make the reader see,” Willis said. Wright’s language “doesn’t describe, but springs into action,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">Louise Akers GS, a graduate student in literary arts, enjoyed Willis’s analysis, saying she “was interested in the way that she evoked the performativity of language, especially in terms of the scripture and law.”</p>
<p class="p2">Willis amused the audience by alluding to C.D. Wright’s love for particular lexicons of particular occupations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also entertained and showcased her poetic prowess through the quip dedicated to C.D. Wright: “I came, I saw, I Arkansas.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University orchestra performs under guest conductor</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Several challenges may have been anticipated for the Brown University Orchestra when conductor Brandon Keith Brown was relieved of his orchestra duties just one week before the first orchestra concert of the academic year. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But as the musicians delivered a masterful performance to a packed Sayles Hall Friday and Saturday night, it seemed clear that the abrupt transition in conducting duties had not hindered them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Under the baton of guest conductor Daniel Harp, teaching associate in music, the orchestra plunged into Brahms’ Symphony No.1 in C Minor, impressing members of the audience. “(Brahms’s First Symphony) is a great piece and (the orchestra) did a splendid job with it,” said Katie Byrnes ’21, a member of the audience on Saturday night. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The piece, which comprises four movements, was composed by Brahms over a period of at least 14 years, Harp noted before the performance. It is a manifestation of Brahms’ inner turmoil and the emotion that he was otherwise unable to express, Harp further explained. “Any time there is a break, or a lyrical moment, it reverts very quickly back to some kind of turmoil.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Harp described the first movement as a “storm of emotion.” Following the “storm,” the second movement starts off innocently, almost like a love song, Harp said. But within four measures, the piece crescendoes. It seems as though “(Brahms) just can’t hold onto a simple motion for very long,” Harp explained. On the other hand, he noted that the third movement is a beautiful intermezzo — carefree, away from the turmoil. A contrasting fourth movement that “seems philosophical — dark, full of destiny” followed, as Harp described. This movement ends with a dramatic, triumphant finale, proficiently executed by the orchestra. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Although Harp only began working with the orchestra as a conductor Tuesday, the musicians themselves had been practicing for the concert since the academic year began. Harp denied having faced any obstacles due to the unusual circumstances preceding the concert.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The previous conductor was actually very effective in rehearsals,” Harp told The Herald. “The reason that there was a change made was not musical, so that’s an advantage.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“What we had to do was work together to figure out how I wanted them to play the piece,” he continued. “I could not second guess the other conductor and try to figure out how he was doing it.” Fortunately, on account of Harp’s conducting experience and familiarity with the work being performed, this did not prove to be a demanding task, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While it is uncommon for a transition in conducting duties to precede a performance, members of the orchestra agreed that the adjustment was seamless. Violonist Sara Shapiro ’20 expressed that she was thankful Harp was able to step in. “He’s doing a fantastic job and making a really good situation of something that wasn’t so good before.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Evan Browning ’18, vice president of the orchestra, shared a similar sentiment. It has been “a whirlwind of a week,” he told the audience before the performance began. But Harp’s “talent with music and willingness to engage with students” was what made the transition smooth, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Harp was confident in the orchestra’s ability to execute a successful performance. “They’re playing very well,” he said before the concert of Friday. “It’s going to go beautifully.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Not everyone might play perfectly,” he added. “But mistakes don’t matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s the grand scheme of things.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lights come on to spotlight a masked individual, clad in all black, who repeatedly kicks a large box in the center of the stage for seemingly a whole minute. How is an audience supposed to react to such a spectacle? Some audience members laughed nervously at the initial absurdity before the rest of the cast declared themselves as the “Triumphant Threesome,” a group of unintimidating amateur superheroes ready to stop the menacing villain already on stage. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The audience’s response of disorientation and delightful surprise was the cornerstone of Production Workshop’s “3C2C,” which included six short plays written and directed by students, staged Friday through Monday in the Downspace. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> As implied by the production’s title “3C2C,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>playwrights and directors were challenged to incorporate three chairs and two cubes into their sets. Though this served as a defining commonality between works, it’s hard to draw comparisons between the plays. The productions spanned across genres, from comedy to drama, and presented different, often absurd scenarios. This constant shift in material kept the audience amused, even during segments that fell short of their desired effect. The breadth of progressive topics, ranging from the difficulties of queer love to the complexities of grief, reflected the diverse themes created by the student playwrights. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Passion was successfully displayed on stage with many emotionally charged performances, such as Christien Hernandez ’21 portrayal of Jake, a young man who becomes angry and fearful upon discovering he could have contracted HIV, in “House of Virgina.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Generally, the most successful and moving plays demonstrated elements of drama and comedy that worked in tandem. The last in the program, “Crystal &amp; Applesauce,” written by Samantha Crausman ’19 and directed by Beth Pollard ’21, featured three teenage girls trying to make light of their three-year entrapment in a bunker they entered in preparation for the 2012 apocalypse. It was difficult not to laugh as the most enthusiastic of the three, Hannah, played by Juliet Norvig ’18, persistently recreated different holidays in their sparse setting using their few belongings, particularly applesauce, to combat the group’s fatigue. Norvig and her co-stars impressively conveyed a self-awareness of the futility of their efforts, as they knew that their food supply would soon run out. Nonetheless, the performance ended on a hopeful note when the audience heard the bunker door creak open, and the girls looked up, hoping to finally have been found.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many of the playwrights, directors, actors and stage crew had little to no experience working in the theater at Brown prior to “3C2C.” The participants ranged from first-years to seniors who wanted a chance to get involved at PW before they graduate, said Raphaela Posner ’18, who directed “Lauren, the Last Dinosaur, a Friendly Dilophosaurus.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “It’s empowering to see the commitment people bring,” said Gavin Petty ’21, director of “A Dead Dog.” “Everyone tries so much harder because they want to be there.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Production of “Waiting for Godot” impresses with humor, soliloquy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot” stands as one of the dramatic world’s most complex works, widely recognized since its 1959 publication for its minimalist plot and thematic absurdities. The now-canonical avant-garde play primarily takes the form of conversations between Estragon and Vladimir, as the duo futilely bide their time for the eponymous Godot to arrive. Comically non-linear and dripping with dark humor, these interactions’ deliberately confusing nature preclude any real plot progression and defy any concise summary. Rather, they work as hilariously bleak canvases from which viewers might project their own interpretations, be they metaphysical renderings of Godot as an unreliable God or Freudian studies of the self. Though Godot fails to arrive by the play’s conclusion, audiences are left with decidedly more profound gratification when they exit, forced to grapple with the existential themes Beckett poses. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Well-acted and wildly funny, AS220’s Counter-Production Theatre Company’s version of “Waiting for Godot” manages to do the Irish playwright some justice. The production, directed by Valerie Remillard, hits all of Beckett’s comic elements to a tee — a draw that may be in no small part attributed to leads Geoff Leatham and Dan Fischer. Playing Estragon and Vladimir respectively, the pair complement each other well, readily exchanging high degrees of wit and slapstick violence. Fischer and Leatham’s dramatic dexterity more than compensate for the existential languor of the play, especially for the less philosophically-inclined members of the audience. Leatham, capable of animatedly moving from the crestfallen to the ecstatic, demonstrates a range of expression and delivery particularly deserving of commendation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The two actors are intermittently joined by an opposing pair comprising Steven Zailskas and Stevie Smith, who play Pozzo and his mute minion Lucky. Functioni</span><span class="s4">ng as more active foils to the passive couple of Estragon and Vladimir who resign themselves to waiting for Godot by a tree stump, Pozzo and Lucky are domineering and relentlessly comic forces. As Pozzo, Zailskas brashly delivers his lines and interrogates Estragon and Vladimir like some cartoonish and flamboyant supervillain. All the while, he oscillates between eating chicken and whipping Lucky. Even as Pozzo ostensibly turns blind in act two, Zailskas never loses sight of the character’s excitable and restless demeanor. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the honor of the production’s most impressive performance goes to Smith. Otherwise tongue-tied for the duration of the play, Smith as Lucky launches into a soliloquy at the end of Act One, which surely knocked out a couple audience members at Saturday’s showing. Lucky’s sole lines as they appear in this soliloquy are often cited as one of the play’s apical moments, starting out as some philosophical rumination before blurring into inscrutable absurdity in a prime instance of the play’s frustratingly fascinating ambiguity. Smith conveys the soliloquy with real technical complexity, spitting out rapid-fire prosody without even a moment’s breath like a French absurdist seized by the Golden Age of hip-hop. Connor Remillard Myette executes another standout performance as a comparatively minor character, delivering the news of Godot’s continual delays with a grave tone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The simple and bare-bones set design, comprising only a starkly towering tree and a stump, accentuates the minimalist merits of Godot and plays to AS220’s tiny Black Box theater’s strengths. Audiences members’ seats circumscribe the stage on three sides, emulating what it must feel like to observe Pamplona’s running-of-the-bulls as unrestrained chaos unfolds within a pinky’s reach of the crowd. A few times throughout the show, Pozzo even grazed against some crowd members’ feet, to the terror of some unsuspecting children in attendance. Such intimacy would be difficult to replicate at venues larger than the Black Box Theatre and underscores the contained and claustrophobic craziness of the five-character slow-burn that is “Waiting for Godot.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Indeed, Counter-Production’s iteration of Beckett’s work permits audiences to enjoyably suspend their rational faculties for the play’s nearly three-hour running time. Off the walls with deft performances by the whole cast, “Waiting for Godot” should be on anyone’s list of stellar home-grown Providence theater.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Thursday night, in Studio 2 of the Nelson Fitness Center, the Brown Capoeira Club held an open practice in hopes of attracting new members and showcasing their craft to the Brown community.</p>
<p class="p4">Fusing combat, acrobatics and dance into a dynamic, culturally reverent artform that is practiced all over the world, capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian form of self-defense that sets elaborate fighting maneuvers to music, noted club instructor Donnie Senna, who is known to his students as “Tatu.” Still in conversation with its roots as a form of “martial arts that was disguised as a dance by slaves” in 16th-century Brazil, capoeira at Brown exists as more than an art form, but rather as a powerful means of cultural expression, Senna said.</p>
<p class="p4">An expert practitioner of his craft, Tatu splits time between training with Grupo Ondas, a professional capoeira group in Warwick, and overseeing the club at Brown. With eight active members, the Brown Capoeira Club holds training sessions three times a week and welcomes novice walk-ins — no dance or combat experience is necessary to participate in practices. Tatu prides himself on fostering a tight-knit community where capoeira enthusiasts feel comfortable leaving their worries outside of the studio, he said. “It’s pretty fun,” Tatu added. “The kids have a good time.”</p>
<p class="p4">But the “good time” descriptor may be an understatement. As old school hip-hop blasted through the studio, setting the tempo for the fast-paced fighting sequences that were about to take place, giddy participants expressed their excitement both vocally and through dynamic movement. When asked about his experience so far, Vanya Cohen GS said, “I didn’t expect to be this sweaty.”</p>
<p class="p4">After a round of stretching exercises, the practice split into two groups. Tatu took Cohen aside and attempted to teach him the art of the cartwheel — a constitutional arrow in every aspiring capoeirista’s acrobatic quiver, Tatu noted. Meanwhile, Tatu’s more experiencedstudents chatted while “sparring” — a form of shadowboxing of sorts in which capoeiristas enact the motions of combat without actually making contact with one another. Such intricate maneuvers undoubtedly require a penchant for rhythm, precision and peripheral awareness in the face of Tatu’s technical critique, which often reiterated<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the importance of fluidity and exactitude. If the capoeiristas weren’t delivering corkscrew-like kicks to the air beside each other’s knees, they were effortlessly vaulting into cartwheels to escape their opponents’ reach. “Stop watching his feet,” he commented in reference to a participant’s sparring method. “You want to keep surprise on your side!”</p>
<p class="p4">Club president Lucas Kang ’18 had no dance experience before joining the group, but once he got involved, he was hooked. “It was really interesting because there was more than martial arts involved,” he said. “There was history and culture and I got to <span class="s3">know a lot of people.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">“I had a bad experience (that is) haunting me,” said Torey Malatia in his opening remarks Monday, Oct. 23 at the “Sound Ideas: Close Listening, Podcasting, and The New Radio” event, which was co-sponsored by the Brown Arts Initiative and Jonathan M. Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship. Malatia is the current Rhode Island Public Radio general manager, president and chief executive office and co-founder of “This American Life,” a weekly podcast with about 2.2 million listeners, according to its <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/">website</a>.</p>
<p class="p4">“I discovered that there is one thing that the Internet cannot do,” he continued. The internet, according to Malatia, was unable to teach him how to tie the exceptionally long tie that he was wearing.</p>
<p class="p4">“What I have just demonstrated is one way to open a podcast … (by) making the audience wonder, ‘What is happening?’” Malatia said, amid widespread chuckles.</p>
<p class="p4">In addition to Malatia, panelists included Morra Aarons-Mele ’98, founder of Women Online and creator of podcast “Hiding in the Bathroom”; Alan Nakagawa, an interdisciplinary sound artist who works as the artist-in-residence at the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, and Sam Harnett and Chris Hoff, founders and hosts of the podcast “The World According to Sound.”</p>
<p class="p4">Despite their differing backgrounds, all of the panelists are leaders in thought “who use sound as their artistic and entrepreneurial platform,” said Butch Rovan, director of the Brown Arts Initiative.</p>
<p class="p4">The panelists were each given time to introduce themselves and present their experiences and works. Then all five participated in a panel moderated by Malatia.</p>
<p class="p4">Aarons-Mele, who is soon launching a podcast about sexism and patriarchal social structures, insisted that it is crucial to have “a relationship with a listener.” She further explained that she feels like she knows some of her own listeners. “Podcasting is so intimate,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">Harnett and Hoff’s podcast is “an evocative, unusual sound rendered in intense aural detail,” according to a Jan<span class="s3">. 4, 2017 article published by the Washington Post that was cited in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/entertainment/podcasts-2017/">program</a> of the event. During their presentation, they played an excerpt from their first episode, which featured a recording of mud pots. Harnett said that he and Hoff want their show to be a place where people can hear sounds and formulate their own reactions and ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> On starting a podcast, Aarons-Mele said “you have to do it because you are driven to speak your truth.” Harnett advised against making “a knockoff of existing podcasts … you have to be thinking outside of the box,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> During the question-and-answer portion of the event, an audience member asked for the panelists’ takes on the “earbud revolution,” noting that many students use these listening devices. To this, Malatia touched upon a podcaser’s delicate task of “balancing out the desire for some sort of shared social experience … and the power of a private experience.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> After the presentations and panel, Danny Warshay ’87, executive director of the Nelson Center for Entreprenuership took the stage to present about entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “Our panelists saw a need for something and developed a small solution,” Warshay said, interweaving his expertise with that of the panelists. He then shared some of his experiences and provided tips for aspiring entrepreneurs, highlighting the importance of practicing bottom-up research and finding an unmet need.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Audience member Olivia Katcher ’18, a Herald staff writer, said that both portions of the event emphasized the need to cater to a specific market. An English and history of art and architecture double concentrator who has recently discovered her “entrepreneurial spirit,” Katcher was excited that “both of my passions, entrepre</span>neurship and art … are … colliding.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘The Snowman’ entrances viewers with sheer awfulness</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Great cinema is partially defined by how it responds to the moment in which it’s made — think “The Best Years of Our Lives” and postwar America, “Bonnie and Clyde” and ‘60s counterculture, “Do the Right Thing” and post-Civil Rights racism. Well, folks, get ready for the zeitgeist’s newest captor. From cartoonishly evil politicians to sublimely vapid Instagram poets to everything in between, we’re living in the age of hopeless self-parody, and “The Snowman” is here to ensure we don’t forget it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A symphony of bad decisions, “The Snowman,” directed by the respected Swedish filmmaker Tomas Alfredson and based on Jo Nesbo’s bestselling novel, purports to tell the story of a Norwegian detective working a serial killer case. But its narrative strands are so jumbled and clumsily executed that it seems altogether presumptuous to claim that this movie is really about anything, save for the perversely fascinating question of how a team of talented individuals could produce such a whopping misfire. Alfredson claims that he ran out of production time and wasn’t able to film about 15 percent of the screenplay. As it turns out, that’s not a great way to make a movie. Who knew?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The detective at the center of the film is the ignominiously-named Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender), who by every hilariously obvious indication is a “Troubled Man.” When we first see him, he’s holding an empty bottle of vodka, has a cigarette dangling out of his mouth and bears the facial expression of someone who has been in battle since the Trojan War. At the office — Oslo Police headquarters — his boss tells him that he needs to shape up. “I’m dealing with it,” Harry responds. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Harry soon gets an anonymous letter in the mail, which has a cryptic message and a sketch of a snowman in place of a signature. When he</span><span class="s4"> later goes to a missing woman’s house and sees an eerily similar snowman built outside, he begins to connect the dots.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Unfortunately, neither he nor anyone else ever really finishes connecting the dots, thanks to a bunch of extraneous plot points that crop up all over the place. The main distraction is recently-transferred police detective and Harry’s de facto partner Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson), who is obsessed with a case from nine years ago involving the alleged suicide of police detective Gert Rafto (Val Kilmer). In a series of disorienting flashbacks, we see Rafto working on a case that bears some resemblance to Harry’s. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Back in the present, Harry and Katrine find another victim, this time a woman lying headless in her chicken coop. When Harry discovers the woman’s head placed on top of a snowman, his worst fears are realized. Ours, on the other hand, are not. Even when topped with a human head, there’s something distinctly untroubling about the appearance of snowmen — an unfortunate fact, given that the film is filled with portentous close-ups of them.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The two detectives follow various confusing leads in their pursuit of the killer. One suspect is Dr. Vetlesen, whom the detective seems to find suspicious chiefly because he is a man with painted toenails. Vetlesen also has a connection to the smooth-talking, pervy mayor of Oslo, Arve Stop (J.K. Simmons), who in turn has some kind of connection with Gert Rafto. Needless to say, the film’s gestures toward conspiracy fall flat.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Surprising to no one who has ever seen a detective movie, the investigation takes Harry’s attention away from his family. Though Harry is currently single, his ex-girlfriend’s son looks to him as a father figure. The film illustrates Harry’s struggle to balance work and family with a groaning heavy-handedness, such as when Harry leaves town to follow a lead and forgets the father-son school camping trip he had promised to go on. And the portrayal of his relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Rakel (Charlotte Gainsbourg), is as dramatically inert as everything else in the film.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Fassbender, who delivered one of the best performances in a studio movie this year as an android in “Alien: Covenant,” delivers in “The Snowman” one of the year’s worst. He’s a walking mound of complicated detective cliches, and even his attempts at humor make you want to turn away from the screen just to spare him the humiliation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Alfredson’s direction is similarly dreadful. Though not having the full screenplay to work with certainly didn’t help, that which does make it into the film doesn’t exactly leave you wanting more. The editing is a mess, the camera work uninspired and the few instances of computer graphics genuinely terrible. He also inserts endless hysterical curiosities, from Harry solemnly eating ice cream on a bus to a very deliberate shot of a symmetrically s</span><span class="s3">liced sausage to an old Norwegian man inexplicably wearing a pair of Beats headphones. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s moments like these that make “The Snowman” ascend, or perhaps descend, to a plane of utterly entrancing awfulness. It might be the worst film of the year, and yet it’s also, somehow, a must-see. Why bother with just another good film, when you could sit down and dig into this freshly half-baked meal of delicious failure?</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wayland ’18.5: ‘Beach Rats’ makes the mundane riveting</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Beach Rats” is a stirring mood piece and a fine addition to director Eliza Hittman’s burgeoning body of works. The film’s rhythmic cycles sculpt its somber core — Hittman constructs a hazy atmospheric world simply by following her protagonist, Frankie, as he performs a series of daily rituals on loop. Such commitment to audiovisual aesthetics often comes at the expense of a thoughtfully articulated plot, and the film suffers when it tries to tell its story through action and dialogue. But then, “Beach Rats” does not seem overly concerned with positioning its protagonist as a linear storytelling subject. Rather, the film builds its form around mood to focus the viewer’s attention inward and away from plot. It moves toward more tender and difficult questions surrounding Frankie, an overly masculine and closeted young man living in Brooklyn, and how he understands his own position in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The plot is simple enough. Frankie and his wife beater-wearing crew aimlessly loiter around the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, committing petty crimes, chasing girls and doing drugs. Frankie eventually gets himself a girlfriend, but he secretly spends his nights perusing gay chat rooms, which occasionally lead to clandestine sexual encounters with older men. Frankie lacks an outlet to address a sexuality that confuses him: Between his entourage and a home tainted by his dead father, he quickly begins to suffocate from the interiority inflicted upon him by his environment. The film ends as it began, with Frankie staring out at fireworks over the Coney Island pier and pondering his entrapment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is what happens between those moments of plot production that matters, though. “Beach Rats” is paced by a pulsing, dark energy. Hittman sets much of the film at night, and the pier’s neon lighting provides a trippy and buzzing backdrop for the action. Hittman and cinematographer Helene Louvart consistently focus the film’s gaze upon male bodies, primarily in states of undress. At times the camera feels voyeuristic, catching stolen glimpses of anatomy from late night chat room sessions. More often, though, the film’s gaze unashamedly lingers on the bodies of its subjects. It’s a refreshing means of undercutting the traditionally heteronormative and patriarchal cinematic gaze.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even the mundane becomes erotic. Fire hydrants, boxing bags and even a crucifix torment Frankie. You are meant to feel his sexual angst. He often repeats, “I don’t really know what I like.” The rules and codes of Frankie’s world make resolving his self-doubt all the more difficult. Drug use and misdemeanor crimes are accepted as casual practice, the price of having fun. Frankie’s encounters with older men, on the other hand, feel illicit<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— they often meet in deserted parking lots and sneak off to secluded wooded areas before engaging in sexual intercourse.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Near the end of the movie, Frankie tells his friends that he uses gay chat rooms to score weed. Without revealing too much, this semi-confession leads to a moment in which Frankie is forced to pretend to his friends, who see him as straight, that he is gay. His entrapment becomes layered — he becomes a closeted man, performing straightness, performing gayness. “Beach Rats” succeeds because it rarely requires plot to make you understand how suffocating those moments feel.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Beach Rats” concludes its run at Avon Cinema today.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Fishman ‘What Remains’ exhibition concludes after two months</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From September through October, a large elm log, stripped of its bark and sliced into 56 pieces, rested in the middle of the lobby of the List Art Center as a part of Richard Fishman’s exhibition “What Remains.” The David Winton Bell Gallery itself contained the rest of Fishman’s pieces — gray and black protrusions that began as deconstructions of the elm tree fused with carbon composite and progressed toward pure carbon structures, devoid of any wood element.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An artist talk and vocal performance on “What Remains” occurred Thursday, though the exhibition itself closed Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The elm tree, from which earlier pieces in the collection were derived, was originally a giant tree on Thayer street in front of the Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs. It was cut down in 2003 because it was sick, and Fishman, a professor of visual art at the University, repurposed the tree for his Elm Tree Project that used carbon fibers in combination with elm tree slabs, creating a link between the inorganic and the organic. He used carbon fibers to strengthen the slabs of elm as they were cut, so that there would be no breakage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I used carbon fiber because I’d never used it before, … and it was super light and super strong. But then I liked its blackness. And I liked the process,” Fishman said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“No Apparent Source of Light,” the sculpture part of the collection,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>appeared unimposing, resting on the furthest wall of the exhibition room. A dark, smooth piece, it evoked a soft luminosity that made the audience think of moonlight.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“My pieces — I make them to touch. And to get to the point that it is so sensuous that it would drive you crazy,” Fishman said. “In the making of things, … there’s a great satisfaction I find. And using my hands … to translate all of the various emotions that come from touch,” Fishman said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“This is … a ton of time with really slow work. … It’s just a piece of wood that’s sanded. Like the process is totally hidden, we have no idea how he made this,” said Frans van Hoek ’18, who attended the event and said he found “No Apparent Source of Light” to be the piece that he had the most visceral reaction to. “You can remove all traces of yourself but still communicate all of yourself,” he added</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The works in the lobby “are the introduction to the show, the works created towards the end of when he was working with the elm,” said Jo-Ann Conklin, the director of the David Winton Bell Gallery. “The later ones are totally carbon fiber. … None of the elm tree exists under these new pieces. He’s moved on beyond the elm tree.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I was interested in the transition away from working with the wood and what happened when the wood disappeared. And so ‘What Remains’ is sort of a multifaceted title. Part of it is what remains when the wood is not present anymore,” Conklin added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fishman’s talk was preceded by an improvised vocal performance by Laurie Amat, a local vocalist. The performance occurred in the space that held Fishman’s most recent, pure carbon fiber sculptures ­— four slabs of sleek and shiny carbon pieces that gleamed back the audience’s reflection.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If you look, you can see the whole world in there … The finish is beautiful,” Amat said, adding that she offered to do a performance after having an extremely visceral response when she saw the exhibition for the first time. “What I do is pretty visceral, so I kind of had a plan, but when I came in today … it got deep, really fast. … it’s hard for me to describe (the performance), but it happened. I mean, this is amazing, this work. It makes me want to play with carbon fiber.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You think it’s just black, but it’s so alive,” she said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Saturday night, a crowd of fright-seeking students converged on the steps of Sayles Hall to experience the Brown Japanese Cultural Association’s abandoned hospital-themed haunted house, the club’s annual Halloween event.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After descending the stairs to the basement of Sayles, participants hesitantly traveled through each room of the haunted house, flinching and screaming as actors dressed as ghoul-like doctors and patients suddenly jumped into view. This year’s event was not suited for participants with any hemophobic tendencies, as fake blood covered the space in syringes carried by ghoul-like nurses and on the heavily stained hospital gowns of patients. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There were a lot of jump scares, but it wasn’t too bad,” said Sonya Bui ’21.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The short video montage of horror-inducing clips screened before the live-action segment of the haunted house illuminated the theme’s inspiration: Japanese horror films set in hospitals. Themes from previous years have included other performance-related elements of Japanese aesthetic and pop culture tradition, including geishas and a doll factory. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The club continues to hold the annual event to fundraise and promote the club to the community, said Kiyomasa Kuwana ’19, co-president of JCA. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Organizing and acting in the event also presents a bonding experience for the club’s members. “Everyone becomes closer,” added co-president Vicky Zhou ’18. “It’s a great opportunity to bond with each other and have fun.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Zhou added that the haunted house has been a JCA tradition for most of the club’s existence and is their largest and most popular event of the semester, followed in the spring by Matsuri, an annual festival with street food and games. She added that JCA also holds smaller events for its members like a curry night at the beginning of the year and a Japanese-themed Secret Santa activity during the holidays.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Similar to past years, the fright night haunted house proved very popular. Over 500 people indicated they were “interested” on the Facebook event and several people were denied entry at the end of the night since the venue was at capacity. Zhou confirmed that the club has come to expect this turnout, as students from the University attend, as well as those from neighboring colleges like Rhode Island School of Design and Johnson and Wales University. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s just amazing to see so many people interested and coming to our event that we haven’t seen before,” Zhou said. “It really gets the word out about our club.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Weezer’s ‘Pacific Daydream’ album drop disappoints</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For those who are desperately missing the early 2000s, Weezer’s latest album “Pacific Daydream” will more than deliver. Rivers Cuomo and company have delivered a bland and energetic romp that feels more like a half-hearted tribute to Bowling for Soup than the rough, wry material they came onto the scene with back in 1994.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Feels Like Summer,” the first single released from the LP, came out this past March. Though the song attempts to be a jovial ode to the freedom of summer and breaking the chains of banality,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it mostly succeeds as a grating reminder that Cuomo cannot and should not sing in a falsetto. Cuomo does best when he stays within the boundaries of his signature throaty slacker vocals — not when he pretends to be Bruno Mars. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Happy Hour,” the next single, slated for radio release today, feels like another staid attempt to connect with a working-class audience. Complaining about how his boss — portrayed as a nagging woman, an uninspired capitalization on a tired trope — is always on his back, Cuomo whines about how he just wants to hit his local dive bar after a long day at work. Sorry, when’s the last time any member of Weezer worked a nine-to-five? Granted, many successful artists before have feigned grass roots successfully, but this song falls flat. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This lack of authenticity pervades the rest of the album as well. The quaintly-titled “La Mancha Screwjob” combines strange autotuned lyrics with a misplaced Latin beat. “We’re getting stronger, stronger, we’re getting faster, faster,” Cuomo sings. What? Current band membership includes four middle-aged adult men ranging in age from 47 to 52. The only thing that should be getting stronger and faster for these guys are their golf swings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Weezer lacks self-awareness. They are still pretending to be the new, cool kids on the scene instead of accepting the fact that they are closer in age to Phil Collins than the Jonas Brothers. Some of the uninspired, faux-youthful energy in “Pacific Daydream” may be attributable to producer Butch Walker. Walker, who in recent years has worked with Taylor Swift and Carly Rae Jepsen, specializes in the easily catchy genericism of modern commercial pop. But Carly Rae Jepsen Weezer is not.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s time for Weezer to lean into their 50s. They really are a good band, and they do have the ability to be better. Although some may advocate for a return to form, Weezer should be primed to keep moving forward rather than planting their feet in the mud of mediocrity. Their failures in recent years could be perhaps remedied by an honest album about the trials and tribulations of grappling with declining virility — not pretending to be 20-year-old beach bums who just want to have fun, man.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Alt-rock outfit Bellerophon sends off Aurora</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Friday night, the indie and electronic pop Providence-rooted group Bellerophon performed at music hall Aurora in downtown Providence, stirring up combustive, synth-heavy ecstasy in one of the creative capital’s most seminal venues. The concert was one of Aurora’s final shows and serves as a flattering adieu to an integral space for musicians residing in the 401. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A part of the “Aarp-Tronix” showcase of local electronic music, Bellerophon’s set joined those of fellow artists The Kolour Kult and Favourite. But the outfit’s sound remains singularly defined by a diversity of influences encompassing everything from 80s new-wave to Italian industrial music. “Our influences extend from Depeche Mode to The Knife to Juan Luis Guerra,” said Mauricio Ossa, Bellerophon’s vocalist, lead guitarist and frontman. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Such a multifaceted soundscape might lend itself to a certain performative flexibility — a virtue epitomized by the group’s recent addition of saxophonist Ben Shaw, who debuted with Bellerophon Friday night. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This was actually my first ever gig with (Bellerophon),” Shaw said. “Mauricio contacted me a while back about playing synths and horn with him, but then the supremely talented keyboardist Antonio (made) his way into the group,” Shaw added, alluding to the aural gap filled by Antonio Forte, whose inaugural performance as a member of Bellerophon was at Providence’s Foo Fest on Aug. 12. Today, the group is comprised of Shaw, Forte, Ossa and drummer Brian St. Pierre.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Aurora show, along with Shaw’s addition, bolster the burgeoning alt-rock outfit’s upward momentum. With each supplemental part, the group gains a broader and more transformative sound — a sonic apex perhaps most realized in Friday’s set as the group appeared in its largest, most comprehensive incarnation to date. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The sound was much bigger and fuller and projected more confidence as we’ve become more accustomed to each other,” Ossa said. “We’re much more consolidated as an ensemble.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday’s “Aarp-Tronix” marks Ossa’s final show at a venue that has done much to cultivate his creativity. “I played a handful of shows at Aurora in 2014 with an indie rock project called ‘Blacksow,’” Ossa said. “But as Bellerophon, I made my debut there in February 2015 and in subsequent shows went on to open for UK band ‘Until the Ribbons Break’ during the Free Mondays concert series.” In 2016, Ossa was awarded a Dorry — an arts and culture award bestowed by the Law and Order Party, a Rhode Island newsletter — for electronic act of the year. “Honestly, some of my best musical moments happened (at Aurora). … I’m sad to see it go.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Aurora has always been fantastic to us,” Shaw said. “I used to go to Wednesday’s jazz jams all the time when it was still called the Roots Cultural Center and then was fortunate enough to be the emcee of the next iteration of the jam when it switched to Aurora,” Shaw added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a press release, Aurora officials both lamented its closure and celebrated its history as “a vibrant venue for creative expression and community interactions.” And although its illustrious pedigree of performers includes such nationally-acclaimed musicians as Thee Oh Sees and Denzel Curry, the venue has chiefly served to spotlight and mature local artists like Bellerophon from its inception. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“That place has just given me so many fantastic memories and opportunities to make music for and with good people,” Shaw said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wayland ’18.5: ‘Goodbye Christopher Robin’ overly sentimental, forgettable</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A child’s mind is the ultimate theater for imagination, but you’d never know it watching “Goodbye Christopher Robin.” Directed by Simon Curtis, the film stars Domhnall Gleeson as A.A. Milne and Will Tilston as his son, Christopher Robin Milne, and centers around the senior Milne’s creation of the famed Winnie-the-Pooh tales, which were inspired by observing his son’s inventive fantasies. It’s part period piece, part familial drama, part war meditation, part coming of age story — but in the end, “Goodbye Christopher Robin” is just a messy entry and an otherwise forgettable, Oscar-baity biopic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The film follows Gleeson’s Milne, your classically aristocratic British gent, after he returns home from World War I. Wracked with post-war trauma, Milne struggles to regain a sense of normalcy and eventually moves to the countryside with Christopher, his wife, played by Margot Robbie, and their nanny, played by Kelly McDonald in the film’s strongest acting performance. A series of father-son jaunts in the forest form the backbone for Milne’s eventual Winnie-the-Pooh series, but the film assumes a darker character once unexpected fame hits the family. The parents, who have never treated young Christopher as anything but a nuisance — even arguing at one point over who would have to assume caretaking responsiblities in the event of a divorce — use him as a vehicle to advance their own statuses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In terms of sentimental biopics, “Goodbye Christopher Robin” skews more sinister and ambiguous than its counterparts, and certainly more willing to air out dirty laundry. But the film ultimately collapses in its attempt to execute those complexities that characterized Milne’s life. Curtis treats his vision with a heavy hand. Transition cuts occur awkwardly, transporting the reader between eras in an act of uncomfortable time-bending. In one scene, Milne charges through a bunker and directly into an English ballroom. Wartime PSTD has been handled better by films with more nuance and originality. Tilston’s Christopher, who has just outgrown the toddler stage of youth, occasionally offers carefully articulated insights that almost felt like he was reading from a script meant for an adult actor.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If these critiques sounds harsh, forgive me. It’s just easy to become frustrated by the type of film Simon Curtis makes. Jeannette Catsoulis of the New York Times writes: “Hollywood greets the end of the year by suddenly noticing that roughly a third of moviegoers (and three-quarters of art-house audiences) are over 50, most of them women. …(It) can lead to theaters clogged with old-lady bait, which usually means something British and upper-crusty, preferably with literary roots. A dollop of war, a death or two, and it’s off to the awards races.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It’s a style found in “My Week with Marilyn” (which I admittedly enjoyed) and “Woman in Gold,” the last two films Curtis directed. Middlebrow cinema trying to pass for highbrow handles its material with a superciliousness that leaves itself subject to more spiteful criticism. It is precisely that quality that makes “Goodbye Christopher Robin” endlessly more entertaining to lambaste than to actually watch. With that said, don’t let my snobbish judgment stop you from watching the film.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Students to play music under the stars at B-side tent shows</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">B-Side Magazine’s semi-annual Tent Shows will return to Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle this Friday to showcase student musicians in an outdoor setting. Originally hosted by the Brown Concert Agency, the yearly event was taken over last year by B-Side Magazine. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“B-Side is all about showcasing music in general but especially music at Brown and RISD, and Tent Shows is a good way to bring that music to people in person,” said Michael O’Neill ’19, B-Side’s managing editor.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This year we have a variety,” O’Neill added. Spread over three stages and two and a half hours, this year’s concert will showcase sixteen musical acts that represent different genres and styles. Audiences can expect folksy singer-songwriter acts alongside hip-hop performances, electronic instruments and rock bands’ acoustic sets, he continued. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fall Tent Shows have since become one of B-Side’s many community events that provide avenues for the Brown-RISD music scene. “We played Tent Shows last year and had a great time, so we thought it would be fun to play it again,” said Luk Yean ’19, speaking on behalf of his band, Strawberry Generation. B-Side is “doing great work,” he continued. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s one of my first times performing solo on campus with my original material. I’m very excited,” said Allison Rosenbaum ’18, another performer at the event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m very grateful that … (B-Side) has this opportunity where they showcase so many different people,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Planning this event was a month-long process, according to O’Neill. “We only opened up (applications) to Brown and RISD students as performers because we wanted to make sure we highlighted students as part of our community,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This year, every application from performers could be accommodated, allowing for a diverse range of acts. O’Neill said one of the show’s priorities was to have a balanced lineup that ranges in musical genres. “The way the applications this year came in, it worked out naturally,” O’Neill added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Tent Shows does not adhere to any particular theme, it aims to provide a cozy ambiance for students to enjoy live music. “It’s outside on Simmons Quad, and under the stars. We have lights in the trees, blankets and sheets. It’s a quiet, intimate setting.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though there are many “gig opportunities to be found” at Brown, according to Yean, the Tent Shows event is differentiated by its laidback outdoor settings. Tent Shows also accommodates more folksy acoustic acts than the average performance space, Rosenbaum said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking ahead, O’Neill highlighted other upcoming B-Side shows, including their more frequent “Coffee Haus” events, which also give Brown and RISD student musicians performance space. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We can write about music all we want, but actually having student musicians and giving them a platform to perform for their friends and even for people they don’t know is really, really valuable,” O’Neill said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>U. hosts performance of ‘Audiovision: Stockhausen’s Hymnen’</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Granoff Center’s Martinos Auditorium filled with sound Monday. Pieces of national anthems woven with radio static and voices spiraled around the room, as “Hymnen,” an electronic piece by German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, was played through loudspeakers positioned in each corner of the auditorium. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Audiovision: Stockhausen’s Hymnen,” was presented by the Brown Arts Initiative in collaboration with the Cogut Institute’s collaborative humanities program.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Butch Rovan, director of the Brown Arts Initiative, said this performance is different than anything else presented at the University previously. “(You are) listening to music presented in this very immersive, multichannel format, but you’re not looking at anybody performing,” Rovan said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The performance was presented in accordance with a graduate-level course co-taught by Dean of the Faculty Kevin McLaughlin and Professor of Humanities and Comparative Literature Peter Szendy titled “What Was Europe?” This course comes as part of a new initiative focused on collaborative humanities funded through the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The program aims to pilot “PhD-level seminars that highlight collaboration between two faculty members and … graduate students from different departments,” McLaughlin said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Students in the course have been discussing the symbolic representations of Europe, Szendy said. “Without some sort of symbolic representation a political entity doesn’t really even exist because people can’t identify with it,” Szendy added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Hymnen” acted as the reading for this week’s class. “We’ve looked at literature, we’ve looked at visual art … this week we’re looking at music,” McLaughlin said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stockhausen’s piece acts as a “utopian attempt to gather in one musical work many anthems from the whole world,” Szendy said. At the end of the piece, Stockhausen imagines an anthem called “Hymunion,” for a utopian political entity called “Harmondie,” Szendy explained. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stockhausen’s “Hymnen” is divided into four “regions,” which were each presented on Monday night. Each region contains anthems from numerous countries, shortwave radio sounds and voices that speak in different languages, which have been “totally metamorphosed,” Szendy said. At times, sounds combine and clash, creating tension, before falling quiet and calm again. At one point, voices projected through speakers at different corners of the room, announcing varying shades of red in different tones and languages. At the end of the piece, Stockhausen’s own breathing is projected. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before the concert began, Szendy quoted Stockhausen’s introduction at a concert in 2001: “Don’t forget to close your eyes,” he said. While the piece contains no visual elements, Szendy told The Herald that this comment was “precisely a way of generating audio vision instead of preventing it,” as “you have all kinds of images that come to your mind.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On Nov. 10 at 8 p.m., Grammy Award-winning pianist Gloria Cheng will premiere 32 short compositions. Sponsored by the Brown Arts Initiative, the event will commemorate the life of the late Steven Stucky, an acclaimed composer and mentor to Assistant Professor of Music Eric Nathan.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to the works of 31 of Stucky’s other friends and students, Cheng will include Nathan’s work in her performance at the University. She will perform these works, in addition to Stucky’s own composition, at the Martinos Auditorium before she completes the CD with Bridge Records. That Friday afternoon, Cheng will also give a lecture in the Orwig Music Library as part of the “Music Now” series.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Stucky was a “singular force in the world,” Nathan said. “His music was filled with such feeling, intellect and humanity.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nathan first met Stucky at the Aspen Music Festival and School in 2005 as an undergraduate student. He continued to study with Stucky between 2008 and 2012 as a doctorate student at Cornell. “He led lessons like a colleague who was lending another set of ears,” Nathan said, adding that he pushed his students to make decisions on their own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When Stucky passed away in February 2016 at age 66, he left fellow composers, students and followers in mourning. He was a “lovely, erudite and eloquent man who so many of us turned to,” Cheng said. During his career, he taught at The Julliard School and Cornell and was a resident composer at the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In 2005, he received a Pulitzer Prize for his “Second Concerto for Orchestra.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cheng first began working with Stucky when she was playing second keyboard with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Stucky had been working as a new-music advisor during a “golden age” for composition, she said. He would attend practices, bringing a “benign, supportive, funny, humble yet brilliant presence,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">During that time, Cheng began to work with Stucky’s own compositions. She made a recording featuring the works of Stucky and Esa-Pekka Salonen. Stucky suggested that she pair these works with a piece by Witold Lutoslawski, whose work he helped bring to the public eye. When she released the CD in 2008, Stucky wrote the liner notes. The recording received a Grammy for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance. “I know, in my heart, that the reason it won the Grammy was because of Steven,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In April 2016, the director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic suggested that six of Stucky’s friends and former students write their own compositions for a tribute concert. She asked Cheng to divide the pieces amongst different pianists. Upon hearing about this project, more of his friends asked if they could contribute their own works. In response, Cheng decided to organize and perform a larger compilation that would incorporate these different voices.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">She reached out to Stucky’s friends and fellow composers and received an overwhelming response. “I knew how many of us, including me, really wanted a way to express our … grief over losing such a dear man so shockingly and unexpectedly,” Cheng said. So many friends and students of Stucky wanted to participate that Cheng had difficulty creating a list of works short enough for the single recording she will perform next week at Martinos Auditorium.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In bringing this performance — entitled “Garlands for Steven Stucky: Gloria Cheng in Recital” — to the University, Nathan hopes to introduce students to Stucky’s work. Stucky exemplifies what “being an integral part of a musical community” means, Nathan said. He hopes that this event, as well as the “Music Now” lecture series, will give students insight into the close bonds integral to the music community and help foster artistic relationships at the university level.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Last Friday night, the Contemplative Studies Department hosted its first-ever public poetry reading in Smith-Buonanno Hall, inviting poets Genine Lentine, Gabrielle Calvocoressi and Sensei Koshen Paley Ellison to read their respective work and discuss the changing role of poetry and meditative practice in the modern world. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Contemplative Studies Department Coordinator Anne Hart, the poets were chosen because their craft demonstrates “the nexus between creativity and mindfulness,” an intersection the department has recently addressed by creating a third track, “Contemplative Studies and the Creative Arts.” The third track is for students who want to study the literature and history of contemplative art and, in turn, use contemplative practice to inform their artistic endeavors, Hart said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lentine, currently a teacher of writing at the San Francisco Art Institute, approached the podium first. Effectively distilling the symbolic significance from seemingly simple moments, poems like “The Chamber” and “My Father’s Comb” made listeners smile and sigh, as they shared in Lentine’s feelings of gratitude in spite of helplessness. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lentine spoke sincerely about patience as she showed the audience a picture of a begonia plant in bloom, its big leaves silvery in the sunlight. Later, she used a grotesque sketch of a saber-toothed creature preparing to devour a bunny rabbit to demonstrate how poets must be comfortable “being in uncertainties.” Musing on the intersection of creative practice and contemplation, Lentine said that “poetry is about a sense of receptivity and availability to experience. … Contemplation is often understood as a ‘fixed’ thing or a ‘still’ thing, and (yet) there is this deep continuous movement that constitutes stillness, as paradoxical as that might sound. Contemplation is not antithetical to action, and poetry is not antithetical to being of use in the world. Part of our job as poets is not to turn away.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Next to read was Koshen Paley Ellison, co-founder of the New York Zen Center for Contemplative Care. Ellison approached the podium wearing a monastic robe and said “to me, the life of poetry is just the life. The beauty of poetry is of taking the time, because that’s all we have.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Throughout Ellison’s reading, he spoke slowly and meditatively, using personal anecdotes about his aging family members and friends to confront mortality and grief. He often posed universal questions, like “why is there so much fear in just being with another person?” and “how do we relax in our own experience?” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Alexandra Walsh ’19 said she was particularly affected by Koshen’s words. She said she was moved to tears when “Koshen was talking about fully loving someone. … The idea of being able to fully embrace something without trying to understand it, that’s sort of an underlying message that all (three poets) were saying.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Finally, Gabrielle Calvocoressi, a professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, read from her latest book of poems, “Rocket Fantastic.” At some points theatrical and vulnerable, her poems included intimate reflections on uncertainty, love and her mother’s suicide. One poem, “The Sun Got All Over Anything,” contained the lines, “Somewhere my mother was dying / and someone was skinning a giraffe / and I let it go. I just let it go.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the question-and-answer session after the reading, Calvocoressi explained, “I don’t try to heal my trauma. I try to be in the presence of it.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Annual free concert features works from composer Bach</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Sunday afternoon saw Providence community members filing into the MacMillan Reading Room at the John Carter Brown Library for the Freda Bromsen Bolster Memorial Concert. Affectionately named “Bach and Friends,” the concert is an annual event presented in collaboration with Community MusicWorks and features works of Baroque composer J.S. Bach.</p>
<p class="p4">“Bach and Friends” aims to “invite people from the community into the John Carter Brown Library for a free and public concert,” said Tara Kingsley, coordinator of academic programming and public outreach for the library. The Sunday performance marked the eighth year the event has taken place. “It’s a great way to connect the local community with institutions like the (JCB) and with organizations like (Community MusicWorks),” Kingsley added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p4">Community MusicWorks is a community-based organization in Providence that uses “music and music study as a strategy to help people gain a creative voice in society,” said Sebastian Ruth, founder and artistic director of the organization. Its members are comprised of “professional musicians (who) commit themselves to a career that combines performing, teaching, community activism and community development,” Ruth said, adding that this year marks the organization’s 21st season.</p>
<p class="p4">Community MusicWorks’ primary mission is to bring change to the lives of children from underserved communities in Providence, said Katie Sklar, director of development for the organization. Community MusicWorks hopes to help children “speak up for themselves,” become “more community minded, envision whatever dreams they might have and help (their dreams) become realities,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Ruth cited Community MusicWorks’ focus on serving the west end and south side neighborhoods of Providence as an important factor in achieving its goal. “Our work is very much intentionally focused on access,” Ruth said. Their programs are “situated in (these areas) because they are underserved neighborhoods, which have a higher percentage of families living in poverty than anywhere else in the city.”</p>
<p class="p4">The “Bach and Friends” concert was not only a traditional chamber music performance but also a reflection of Community MusicWorks’ focus on social justice and community building. Though the program was centered on Bach, it also featured a contemporary piece composed by Linda Catlin Smith — part of Community MusicWorks’ efforts to play more pieces composed by women, Ruth said. “Female composers are generally underrepresented in classical music,” he explained, adding that the current concert season aims to have equal representation of women and men as composers.</p>
<p class="p4">The concert also featured a concerto by Joseph Hadyn, which showcased a student in Community MusicWorks’ free education program.</p>
<p class="p4">A standing ovation ended the concert, representing the awestruck audience members impressed with both the quality of the performances and Community MusicWorks’ success in leveraging classical music as a tool for social justice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Words ‘flew’ in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts auditorium Saturday, weaving together a tapestry of images and senses during the poetic performance “Flying Words Project.” Internationally acclaimed Deaf American Sign Language poet Peter Cook signed his work while his collaborator, Kenny Lerner, accompanied him with a translation in spoken English. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The performance’s multidimensional form of communication created an accessible and intricate performance.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Professor of Literary Arts John Cayley introduced “Flying Words”by speaking on the essential nature of expanding our understanding of how literature occupies space. “In our world, the languages of true writing have new potentialities of new readers,” Cayley said. “I know ‘Flying Words’ will show us more of the language of poetry and … many things we never knew language could do.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Cook and Lerner have been partners since 1984, when they established the first Deaf poetry series in the United States. Since then, Cook and Lerner have become a globally recognized duo, performing at a multitude of venues including the Poetry Days Festival in Latvia, the 36th International Poetry Festival in Rotterdam and the Theatre Lucernaire in Paris. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lecturer of Language Studies Tim Riker commented on the notion of literacy as more than just a written form. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Spoken word plays with sound. ASL plays with handshakes, repetition, motion, location. It’s not about the words; it’s about the blending of the four parameters of the sign language,” Riker signed to the audience.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riker instructed the estimated 175 attendees to audibly clap above their heads to signify approval or praise during the event, incorporating both spoken English and ASL methods of clapping.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The poetry that he’s able to produce literally captures the stunning linguistic possibilities that ASL has,” said Siena Rafter ’20. “The poetry is composed first in ASL and then later voiced in English, which even my hearing non-signing friends were able to notice — like the English almost takes away from his signing, because what he’s doing is such strong, pure ASL that English can’t even begin to articulate that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The show also incorporated comedy, reenacting a baseball game, bad love poetry and banter. The poetry itself touched on serious geo-political conflicts and social issues.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “To see such a legendary performer given that space last night literally brought me to tears, because we need more Deaf voices in these platforms (and) institutions,” Rafter said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Food Truck Friday arrives at Thayer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nine food trucks parked between the Sciences Library and the corner of George Street last week for Food Truck Friday — the most food trucks Thayer Street has ever seen at one time, according to a Facebook blurb for the event. ­</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though some food trucks park near campus every day, Friday represented the first time Food Truck Friday has ever come to Thayer Street, said Eric Weiner, who coordinated the event through PVD Food Truck Events, the local event-planning division of Providence-based organization FoodTrucksIn.com. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From May to September, Food Truck Friday usually takes place weekly at Roger Williams Park in Providence, Weiner said. Judging from the crowds and the sold out menu items, Brown students and other community members would likely welcome a more regular food truck event in this area, said Purvi Goel ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Whenever we get to October and November, when the weather cooperates, we’re always looking for locations that people are familiar with (and) that have a good density of population where people will enjoy having food trucks,” Weiner said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The gray sky initially threatened to put a damper on the evening, but, after a light drizzling between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m., the food trucks opened for business. With the skies cleared, the sidewalk grew crowded with customers chatting, chewing and enjoying everything from waffles on sticks to barbecue pulled pork.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The idea is that whatever type of food you like, there’s something there for you,” Weiner said. “It doesn’t matter if you are on a date, or you’re a student, if you’re younger or older, if you’re going out to eat with three or four people or a large group — everyone can eat the type of food they want,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Each truck had its own style and colors, from the camouflage print and cheery fairy lights of Open Season, which serves hearty game options, to the bright red of Poppy’s Place, which serves up gourmet waffles. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The waffles from Poppy’s Place had “better toppings” than those served in the Verney-Wooley Dining Hall, said Troy Li ’20, and managed to be somehow simultaneously “fluffier and doughier,” according to Katie Armstrong ’18. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fork in the Road, a truck built around a farm-to-table ethos with gluten-free, vegan and vegetarian menu options, is one of the newest additions to the local food truck scene. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I decided to start this food truck with my wife around May, so I’ve been open on the road since Memorial Day,” said Lou Cruz, the truck’s owner. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After being in the restaurant industry for 22 years, Cruz said leaving the brick-and-mortar setup gave him more flexibility. “All the hard work I was doing (had been) for somebody else. I decided to do for myself.” </span></p>
<p class="p2">Cruz said he strives to run a uniquely “food-conscious truck.” Many food trucks have a less health-conscious fast food model, and, by not conforming to this model, Cruz’s truck, which is not equipped with a fryer, faces less direct competition, he added.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Further up toward Waterman Street sat the distinctive green-and-purple Buddha Belly, which has been in business since June 2013. Founder Paul Gervais owns one of the few Chinese food trucks between New York and Boston. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">His food is set apart by his use of “wholly imported authentic ingredients” complemented by an authentic process of preparation, Gervais said. Gervais has visited Brown before, he said, but had faced complaints from restaurants and parking disputes, which is why he spends weekends at his “sweet spot” by the Rhode Island School of Design Museum instead.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Several spots down, inside of the FanTex-Mexical food truck, a stovetop sizzled as steam wafted from homemade queso. Similar to Gervais, the owners occupy a gastronomic niche, said Dylan Brown, who works on the truck, which is an offshoot of the grilled cheese-offering Fancheezical food truck Owning two trucks creates more options and business, which affords them a competitive edge in the business, Brown said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But establishing a food truck and keeping it running is not exactly a piece of cake. “The first challenge is definitely getting the name out there; starting out, it’s definitely hard to try to book events because the hardest part is … trying to find something that hasn’t already been done,” Brown said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other food truck chefs described the time commitment as the greatest challenge and sacrifice of the industry. “Before I’m even on the truck, I’m on the road four hours per day before I even actually really get going,” Cruz said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The time. The time is a killer,” Gervais confirmed. “This is three times more than I ever anticipated,” he added. “Tonight … you see me for three hours, … but no one’s seen the four hours ahead of time,” he explained.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Yet each chef expressed appreciation for perks of the industry. When Gervais started out, buying a truck presented less of a business gamble than being “tied into a three-year lease” or other binding contracts associated with a brick-and-mortar investment, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cruz voiced his own appreciation of the industry’s benefits. Not only can you be independent, but it also allows for creativity and mobility, “instead of being stuck in one location, as in a restaurant,” Cruz said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s …all a family, so we trade our food off of different vendors, and you get to try everybody’s different stuff. It’s really cool — (an) awesome culture to be a part of,” Brown said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Two guitars, one piano, one couple: The Weepies, an indie pop-folk duo starring Deb Talan ’90 and Steve Tannen, performed at the Martinos Auditorium at Granoff Center for the Creative Arts last Friday. They played stripped-down acoustic versions of their songs — the group’s setlist included oldies such as “Stars” and “Gotta Have You,” dating back to their 2006 album. The two also hosted a song-writing workshop at 2 p.m. in Granoff earlier that day.</p>
<p class="p4">“(My wife and I) listened to every song either of them had ever recorded,” said Butch Rovan, professor of music and director of the Brown Arts Initiative, in his opening address for The Weepies’ performance. “Knowing that Deb was a Brown grad, we always had this dream that we’d bring them back to do something with Brown.”</p>
<p class="p4">“It (isn’t) just their diligence and generosity and spirit that they bring to the act of making music, it’s their wit, their humor, their intelligence, their openness that makes their music so special,” Rovan added.</p>
<p class="p4">A lyrical and lilting style characterizes The Weepies’ music. Their performance drew members from the University and wider Providence community, who sat attentively in the darkness of the auditorium. Between songs, to the soft strumming of their guitars, Talan and Tannen shared stories and insight into their songwriting process.</p>
<p class="p4">For their encore, Talan crooned softly into the microphone the poetic words of “Stars”: “and I feel a pull to the blue-velvet dark and stars.”</p>
<p class="p4">“This is a song that we really co-wrote,” Talan said, as they prepared to perform their encore. “We had the flu. So we started it together, and then one would kind of pass out after a while and then the other would write a verse and then pass out. So this is inspired by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>high temperatures.”</p>
<p class="p4">“The majority of the time, it’s pure force of will<span class="s3"> that gets a song started, recorded and done. Performances are a little different — they are fed by the give-and-take with the audience,” wrote Talan and Tannen in an email to The Herald. “The best crowds inspire better performances and vice versa. It leaves you open in a way that’s hard to talk about, and it’s addictive,” they added</span>.</p>
<p class="p4">“Society doesn’t highly value art or music except in rare cases, so especially as you start out you have to defend your empty time and p<span class="s3">rotect the effort it takes to make something or find your way,” Talan and Tannen wrote. “You have to get comfortable doing your own thing in a fundamentally individual way. That’s challenging every day.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> The Weepies evoked nostalgia within many of members of the audience, some of whom found it difficult to find others with a shared interest in The Weepies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “My parents used to sing them to me. … The last one that she sang, “Stars,” it’s one of my favorites,” said Julia Ostrowski ’20, an attendee of the performance. It was her third time seeing The Weepies perform live. “This was amazing, really emotional and just a very lovely experience to have much later on in life.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Art, design featured in statewide film festival</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The third annual Providence Art &amp; Design Film Festival opened last Thursday, bringing films to Rhode Island that “focused on diverse disciplines within art and design,” according to the festival website. Films will be shown in Providence, Newport and Jamestown at various venues. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The 12-day film festival covers a vast array of topics, ranging from how an artist deals with her mental illness through sculpting to films that center on Chinese typography. The festival also features “Loving Vincent,” an animated film composed of 65,000 oil paintings by 120 artists making up each shot. Also featured is a documentary that follows the influence of Russian oligarchs in the art market — a scenario that might remind first-years of their First Readings text “The Tsar of Love and Techno.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Providence venues include Cable Car Cinema and the Rhode Island School of Design Museum Auditorium. The film<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Design That Heals,” was accompanied by a question-and-answer session with the movie’s media producer, Thatcher Bean. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“These were two of the most intense films I’ve seen in a long time,” said Fran Loosen, a movie-goer who watched “Heaven Is A Traffic Jam On The 405” and “Design That Heals.” “It’s so well-curated that you can come to anything and you’re going to be completely blown away by it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The festival is comprised of films from 10 countries, including short films, documentaries and longer feature films.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Part of what I’m interested in doing is finding people that are invested in material and can speak to it from … personal experience,” said Emily Steffian, the artistic director for the film festival. “It’s got to be educational, engaging to watch and … connected to people around our community.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Apart from Steffian’s criteria, this year’s films don’t follow a particular theme. “Last year, there were a lot of films about photography and this year it was pretty eclectic. … Many different disciplines were featured,” said Daniel Kamil, program director for the festival. “We expanded the kind of idea of what we were … considering to be art and design.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Steffian believes Providence is a prime location to host the film festival. “I just felt … that in and of itself Providence is such an artistic community that there are people here that would come.” She cited Brown and RISD as notable creative communities. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the film festival is even attracting people from outside of the Providence community. “People are coming from all over the place. They’re coming from Massachusetts and Connecticut,” Steffian said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The festival’s organizers are optimistic about future editions as well. “In our third year, we’ve hit our stride,” Kamil said. “We’re going to … continue to explore this to see whether it’s worthwhile expanding it beyond the current footprint.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Friday night, Providence venue Aurora hosted “Mi Gente” — a benefit show thrown to promote support for Puerto Rico in the wake of the tragic circumstances resulting from Hurricane Maria’s landfall. Light reflected off of Aurora’s disco ball for the duration of “Mi Gente,” galvanizing the concert’s throngs of perspiring bodies to dance in an uplifting display of support for the island that many call home. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the artists present at the show comprised a wide spectrum of genres, each act grounded itself in hip-hop and dance conducive to high energy. Providence artists Norlan Olivo, Da Huey X, Wacklikedat, Ushamami, Cam Bells and Shenge all echoed the powerful aspects of Latin American genres, like Bachata, in the ignition and throttle of their music, functioning as an auditory painkiller for those affected by the tragedy. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was great to see many folks come together to show empathy through dance,” said attendee Shey Rivera, a decorated Puerto Rican artist and writer who serves as artistic director of the Providence arts nonprofit AS220. “Dance parties are necessary spaces to practice radical joy and to care for one another, especially (dance parties) that are by and for (people of color) and queer folks — they’re brave spaces where we can be ourselves and sweat off decolonization,” Rivera added, underscoring the cathartic potential of dance. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the University has helped to relieve the crisis through providing free enrollment to students from the University of Puerto Rico, local Providence artists have done their part by coordinating benefit concerts like “Mi Gente.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I wanted everyone in the community — specifically people of color — to come together and feel united in an effort to raise money for Puerto Rico,” Olivo said, who performed at the show and helped organize it with the Aurora staff and members of the Providence-based arts agency Stay Silent. “We raised over three thousand dollars at the event between door sales and percentages taken from the bar,” Olivo added, alluding to the proceeds garnered from drinks and the event’s suggested $10 donation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was a very unique experience with a great audience and choice of musicians,” said Annie Phan ’20. “It was also very heartwarming and inspiring to know the money went to a good cause.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The show marks Aurora’s last official event — a fact that many Providence-based musicians and artists, including Olivo, have mourned. “There was a moment towards the end where I stopped the music and said into the mic, ‘I know there will never be another space like Aurora, but there will be a new space, because we always find a place. When they close the door on us, we just open another one,’” Olivo added, maintaining a degree of optimism for the creative capital’s future in spite of Aurora’s closure. “After that, I played Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Alright’ and the entire crowd just started jumping and singing along.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s moments like those that make me believe that, in a weird way, we’re changing the city and really making progress … even if it seems like an unwinnable battle sometimes,” Olivo said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>68th Edition of Miller’s ‘Line of Descent’ fails to peak</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Avon Cinema leans arthouse in its palate. It has earned a reputation for featuring the types of films that earn rave reviews from “The AV Club” but largely slip through the cracks of mainstream pop culture. Naturally, the Avon is not especially Catholic in its patronage. On any given night, one can expect to find only a smattering of local cinephiles, and perhaps a stray student or two, populating the theater’s seats. But even a guardian of highbrow culture needs to take a few nights off, and there’s no one better to help loosen the intellectual collar than a bunch of ski bums.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Warren Miller Entertainment engine roared into Providence again as part of its yearly film world tour, hosting raucous shows at the Avon on Wednesday and Thursday night. And what a host Warren Miller was.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In what has become a time-honored tradition, the film company’s annual ski documentary drew a full and eclectic house to the Avon, enticing audiences with free lift tickets, discounted apparel, and a raffle that included all-expenses paid vacations to premier international ski resorts — all included with the $20 price of admission.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 68th edition of Warren Miller’s famed ski docs, “Line of Descent,” makes it clear that the brand isn’t going stale. There’s a basic — and successful — formula at work here: attract audiences with giveaways and a grandiose raffle and then keep them entertained with visuals of thigh-high powder and 10,000 foot elevations. I’ve had the privilege of <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/11/09/everywhere-explores-uncharted-slopes/">covering</a> this event for multiple years now and can happily report that the simple pleasures of Warren Miller Entertainment’s globe-trotting, gravity-defying ode to powder chasers and their snow-covered Edens have not abated with time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Like its predecessors, “Line of Descent” unfolds in a series of vignettes, exposing viewers to some of the world’s most remote and idyllic peaks, as well as the weird and wonderful communities built around them. Warren Miller’s attention to the ski bums who form the backbone of those communities is the great gift of the documentary series. There’s a spiritual aesthetic to this clan of adrenaline junkies that’s hard to pin down but deeply alluring. They enjoy an intimate relationship with their natural surroundings that borders on religious. Even their jocular vernacular, full of goofy “pows” and “gnars,” quickly turns ethereal when they are asked to wax poetic about life on the mountain. Miller’s films convince you that these shunners of the 9-to-5 have achieved some form of hedonistic enlightenment — it’s enough to make you want to buy a one-way ticket to the untamed fringes of Montana, Norway or even New Zealand.</span></p>
<p class="p2">That being said, director Chris Patterson has made better work than “Line of Descent.” Last year’s film (also directed by Patterson), “Here, There, and Everywhere,” reveled in the natural beauty of its ski haunts, using an abundance of wide aerial shots that framed skiing as a sublime and celestial act of physical poetry. “Line of Descent” is more theatrical and campy — it loses sight of more natural choreography. Many of last year’s aerial shots are replaced with handheld go-pro filmmaking, which denies viewers depth perception and sense of scope. They break the escapist spell the documentaries have so cleverly constructed over the years.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Line of Descent” is still a fun ride. One vignette centers around surf skiers in the western United States, who use non-binded surfboards to cruise through powder banks. It’s the kind of half-baked scheme that is both hilarious and wildly endearing, a reminder that some people don’t take the world so seriously and get along just fine.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Wonderstruck’ struggles to fully inspire wonder with uneven narrative</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Todd Haynes’ “Wonderstruck” is a film of sounds and images above all else, where feelings and ideas reverberate outward from color and light, smiles and glances, music and art. Haynes has put his enchanting aestheticism to use before in exquisite films like “Far From Heaven” and “Carol.” In those works, his sensitive camera work and penchant for beauty were matched with a fine storytelling sense. But in contrast, “Wonderstruck” suffers from a largely inert and lopsided narrative, leaving the viewer not so much wonderstruck as lightly wonder-touched, misty-eyed but not quite sure why.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Adapted from Brian Selznick’s novel, “Wonderstruck” tells two cleverly paralleled stories of children running away from home and searching for a parent. One tale follows a young deaf girl named Rose (Millicent Simmonds) in 1927, who runs away from her strict guardian in Hoboken, New Jersey to the bright lights and busy streets of New York City. The other strand follows a boy named Ben (Oakes Fegley) in 1977, who lost his mother to a car crash and his hearing from a lightning strike. He leaves his home in Minnesota to go to New York, with his only hope of finding his father pinned on a bookmark he found in his mother’s bedroom. It bears a message to his mother from someone named Danny, as well the address of a bookstore in Manhattan. The cuts back and forth between the two stories turn on simple concepts, from stars to storms to museum plaques, suggesting an inherent connection between these two children living 50 years apart.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Early on, Rose finds her mother, a star of stage and screen named Lillian Mayhew (Julianne Moore). But Mayhew has more invested in the demands of her art than her motherhood and quickly shuffles off Rose to sit quietly in her dressing room. Not one to be subject to such indifference, Rose ventures around New York City. Simmonds is a wonderfully expressive young actor, and Haynes shoots her storyline in silent black and white, mirroring both the era and Rose’s condition. Carter Burwell occupies the silence with his marvelous orchestral score, full of shimmering percussion, piano and richly resonant strings.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both Rose and Ben eventually find themselves at the Museum of Natural History, a child’s playground of curiosities, delights and the occasional nightmare. Ben ends up there after following Jamie (Jaden Michael), a young boy he meets on the street, and the two entertain themselves by chasing each other around the museum. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Haynes and cinematographer Edward Lachman shoot the two boys in silhouette in front of the museum’s many dioramas, placing these children in the larger context of a world in which they’re still trying to find their place. Jamie, whose father works at the museum, shows Ben his “secret room” in an off-limits section. It evokes the excitement of a child making a pillow fort or an igloo in the backyard — the feeling of being able to stake out a space in this world and call it your own. Rose, too, is a young person searching. On top of a meteorite where people throw pennies and make wishes, Rose sets down a small paper boat, inside of which she writes: “Where do I belong?” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s thematically coherent and powerful stuff, to be sure. But there’s little drama to support it. When Ben and Rose arrive in New York, two questions hover over the narrative. Will they find what they’re looking for? And, more intriguingly, how are these stories connected? Other than Rose’s meeting with her mother, there’s not much development regarding either of these questions until the last 30 minutes of the film. It’s a curious approach to a puzzle box premise. The story isn’t meticulously unlocked, piece by piece, but instead ignored or ploddingly gestured at until the film’s information dump of a denouement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saddled with explanation duties, Moore shows up again near the end of the film in the 1977 timeline, wearing lots of age makeup. The explanation itself doesn’t quite inspire the wonder that Selznick and Haynes seem to be after. But the way in which Haynes shows what Moore explains is a stunning feat of production design and visual storytelling and drives home with wit and emotion the film’s thematic concerns. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The moment exemplifies the effect of the film writ large. Bogged down by a story it doesn’t know what to do with, “Wonderstruck” nonetheless has a quiet magic that lives in the folds of its loving sense of craft and its characters’ yearning to belong.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A reception last Thursday closed “Queries (*),” a student art exhibit by Alex Hanesworth ’20 and Sophia Meng ’20 that explored and questioned queer identities. The exhibit occupied the student gallery on the second floor of List Art Center for a week. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Viewers of the exhibit first encountered a wall covered with dozens of graphite comics, which were drawn by Hanesworth and Meng, who later went on to present thoughts about sexual identity, gender and attraction during the reception. An adjacent wall challenged viewers to draw their own comic or write a note about their reactions to the exhibit or personal experiences with identities and exploration of queerness. Finally, viewers entered a dark room to watch an immersive video and sound installation projected onto the walls. The sound component of the installation interlaced snippets of interviews with cuts of people speaking about how they identify and anecdotes about being queer. Viewers watched the bodies of anonymous interviewees as they responded to Meng and Hanesworth’s questions that delved into self-identification and experiences with questioning. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown/RISD Dual Degree student Emilia Mann ’20 said the exhibit was “extremely thoughtful and relatable.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meng and Hanesworth knew they wanted to create a show together when they entered a lottery early this semester to show in the space, but they were unclear about the theme of the work, Meng said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We sat on the grass of the main green for so many afternoons, hashing through ideas,” she added. “It happened almost organically when we were talking about things we had been thinking about.” Hanesworth came up with their specific focuses of questioning and desirability politics, which she defines as the impact of cultural ideals on attraction. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To create the exhibit, Meng and Hanesworth agreed to each make one comic contemplating personal experiences with queerness and identity every day for thirty days before revealing the comics to each other at the end of the month, Meng said. Meng then arranged the comics into a loose narrative that progresses along the gallery wall, Hanesworth added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The idea for the video and sound installation emerged when the artists wanted to conduct interviews in order to move away from their own experiences and represent more queer voices on campus, Hanesworth said. The pair interviewed and filmed 15 people after posting a call on Facebook class pages in an attempt to prompt discussion and “talk about the concept of queerness but specifically those early stages (of questioning) or the ongoing process of figuring out who you are,” Hanesworth said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Friday afternoon, University professors, graduate students and librarians joined Harvard Professor of Literature Deidre Lynch in Pembroke Hall for a workshop entitled “Paper Slips: Album, Archiving, Accident.” The event, which was hosted by the Cogut Institute for the Humanities, followed Lynch’s Thursday night lecture on female literary history. The intimate, registration-only seminar concerned the archiving process documented throughout the Romantic period and their implications for contemporary digitized archives. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a contributor to the prominent journal “Studies in Romanticism” and an editor of the Romantic Period volume of the acclaimed “Norton Anthology of English Literature,” Lynch spoke with authority on the literary movement. She detailed the imperfect nature of Romantic archives, contending that the albums and scrapbooks of the era marked a peculiar “disassemblage” of the period’s culture. These hand-written and homemade archives comprised not only mistranscribed copies of the renowned works of contemporary poets like John Keats and Lord Byron, but also various anonymous ephemera including newspaper poems and crude drawings that would be marked inconsequential by modern archivists concerned with preserving an accurate and complete canon.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Through their dual inclusion of nonessential documents and faulty transcriptions of notable poets, Romantic archives maintained a “project of preservation that was idiosyncratic … and possibly polemical.” Lynch further underscored the unfixed qualities of these miscellaneous Romantic archives and common books by alluding to the fly-away scraps that constituted them — a flimsy architecture prone to damage that defies any notion of the archives as definite, enduring entities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We should view these (archives) as accident-prone things rather than objects of fixity,” Lynch said. “Romanticism hinges on the fragment.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Attendees were instructed to read a pre-circulated collection of papers by Lynch and other academics before arriving to the seminar. The papers expounded upon the nature of Romantic archives detailed in the seminar, while also drawing on the work of semioticians like Jacques Derrida to examine the Romantic “disassemblages” through the lens of media theory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lynch touched on these aspects throughout the seminar, contrasting Romantic archival practices with those present today. Modern archival tools’ capacity for neatly ordaining texts into named and set categories runs counter to Romantic archives’ distinctive instability, Lynch argued, necessarily “transvaluing” archives’ status as “temporary assemblages existing in time.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Lynch “found a space at the intersection of literary studies and media theory that’s still yet to be named,” said attendee Carlos Pittella, a postdoctoral research associate in the Portuguese and Brazilian studies department. “It offers so many sides for emerging fields in the digital humanities.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The seminar was very interesting,” commented attendee Jiawei Tang, a visiting English PhD student from China’s Peking University. “It had me think a lot about the context of the albums and clippings books.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Artist Shirin Neshat talks Iran, feminism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Last Wednesday, Shirin Neshat spoke to a full Martinos Auditorium in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts for the second of Brown Arts Initiative’s Warren and Allison Kanders Lecture Series. Iranian-born artist Neshat works with several forms of media, including film, photography and even music to discuss topics including gender, religion and violence.</p>
<p class="p4">Neshat never studied art. She has what she described as a “nomadic” career which began in photography and has led her to collaborate with different artists in projects that span the globe. She began working with art to express her experience with exile and alienation. She talked about the juxtapositions — including nature versus culture, sexuality versus violence and men versus women — that interest her and play a formative role in her art.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Neshat began her lecture by talking about her work in photography. “I don’t even own a camera,” she said. Instead of taking photos, she organizes scenes and sometimes poses for them. She made her first major body of work, entitled “Women of Allah” after her first trip back to Iran. The photographs, which offered various images centered around poetry, guns and veiled women, proved controversial. Another major body of Neshat’s photography work, “The Book of Kings,” showed stark images of young activists, many of whom sacrificed their lives for their patriotic beliefs. “Photography is about human portraits,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“The Home of My Eyes,” a photographic series, took inspiration from the exaggerated hand positions of earlier Christian paintings. This series offered similar intense black and white portraiture, this time focused on diversity and the concept of the home. When these photos went on display at the Venice Biennale, the Christian references were paired with a permanent installation of the Madonna. Neshat did not plan for this but liked the juxtaposition of the older sacred imagery and her new take on religious themes.</p>
<p class="p4">As time went on, she began to move into film. The works she directed, primarily in black and white, mimicked the starkness and clarity of her earlier photographs. The first full-length movie she made, “Women Without Men,” was based on a book that the Iranian government banned. The story follows five women navigating modern Iran and the possibility of living in a society without men. The author of the original novel, Shahrnush Parsipur, received an honorary doctorate from Brown in 2010. The film took six years to produce and served as “a way to pay tribute to this monumental woman,” Neshat said. Though much of Neshat’s earlier work had not been accessible to people in Iran, many could find her film illegally, bringing her work into homes across her native country, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Her more recent film, “Looking for Oum Kulthum,” was released in September. The film follows a female Iranian director trying to capture the story of the famous Egyptian singer Oum Kulthum. The filmmaker’s story — and the film she struggles to create — tell the tale of women faced with the constraints of a conservative, male-dominated society.</p>
<p class="p4">This past summer, Neshat, who had never worked with music, was asked to direct the opera “Aida,” which has been criticized for its portrayal of Egyptian culture from an Italian perspective. Neshat’s take did away with many of the opera’s conservative and ornate traditions. She used a simple and elegant box structure as the setting for the work. Her commanding use of stark, powerful imagery, was paired with the confines of the Italian opera to form a dynamic juxtaposition, she said. Her production of “Aida” received harsh criticism from some followers of opera and, at the same time, immense praise from others, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">At the end of her talk, Neshat asked the audience how we deal with the past. For Neshat, that answer is clear:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She channels her story into art.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For Samuel R. Delany — award-winning science-fiction writer and essayist on sexuality, society and literature — our humanity does not come from talking about sexual activity. Somehow, he elaborates, our humanity is embodied by the silence that enshrouds sexuality.</p>
<p class="p2">As part of a visit organized by the Department of Modern Culture and Media, Delany spoke candidly about his personal and sexual life in the documentary “The Polymath, or, The Life and Opinions of Samuel R. Delany, Gentleman,” which screened on Nov. 9 in the Martinos Auditorium. The screening of the documentary, directed by Fred Barney Taylor, was followed by Delany’s own experimental film, “The Orchid.”</p>
<p class="p2">During his week in residency at the University, which included the film screening, Delany gave the annual Roger B. Henkle Memorial Lecture, exhibited his works and manuscripts in the John Hay Library and spoke with students and faculty. Hosting Delany at the University was a “joint effort on the part of a lot of different departments,” said Lynne Joyrich, chair and professor of modern culture and media. Originally only chosen for the Henkle Memorial Lecture, Delany’s invitation was extended so he could reach audiences in MCM and English departments as well as The Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America, Africana Studies, the LGBTQ Center and the Pembroke Center, Joyrich said.</p>
<p class="p2">Taylor structured his documentary about Delany as a conversation with a friend. As a gay African-American man, Delany often faces the camera, openly discussing the intersection of his identity and his writing. He is an intriguing figure: 75 years old, adorning a long white beard and glasses and admirably frank about his unconventional sex life (which included having sex with nearly 13 or 14 partners each day while still having dinner ready for his wife). He is a storyteller, with a curious mind and a perceptive view of the world and humanity, yet he characterizes himself as anything but outstanding. He is, in his own words, the “world’s most ordinary, dull, boring, black faggot.”</p>
<p class="p2">As the film progresses, however, his statement is quickly proven false. Delany’s life experience encompasses key historical turning points of the 20th century. He is the grandson of a slave, the nephew of civil rights pioneers and one of the first black students to integrate New York private schools. As a gay man living in the late 20th century, he became acutely aware of the devastation caused by the AIDS epidemic. In 1972, Delany wrote two issues of the comic “Wonder Woman,” which had a feminist story arc in which Wonder Woman became a secret agent. He is a prolific and groundbreaking writer, his work spanning themes of science fiction, perception, language and even pornography, a label he supports.</p>
<p class="p2">“The Polymath,” which tied for the Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the Philadelphia International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 2008, offers a fascinating perspective on not only being queer and black, but also dealing with family issues and mental illness. Delany demonstrates how his passion for writing manifests itself in each of his daily activities — how it translates into a passion for thinking, teaching, and creating.</p>
<p class="p2">Delany’s “Orchid,” a short, experimental film, debuted in 1971 at a science-fiction convention. In the question and answer session, Delany recalled having to stand in the street and ask passersby if they wanted to be part of his zero-budget movie — and having to mention that the part would include full-frontal nudity. The film involved minimal dialogue, a man in a suit, and a microphone — among other bizarre objects and rituals.</p>
<p class="p2">“He’s fantastic, he’s mind-blowing, he’s a trip,” said attendee Erin Wright.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">At 91 years old, pianist Randy Weston remains a dynamic and distinguished figure in the world of jazz music.</p>
<p class="p1">Weston will visit the University this Saturday for a concert with the World Music Ensemble. Weston will be joined by Kwaku Obeng, teaching associate in music and the director of the World Music Ensemble, who will be playing percussion.</p>
<p class="p2">“It is a very eclectic concert. The program has songs from all sorts of traditions,” said Dana Gooley, an associate professor in the music department and one of the principal organizers of the event. But all songs incorporate African influences and percussion, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Weston is distinguished for both his innovative compositions and interest in the connection between African culture and American music, particularly jazz.</p>
<p class="p2">Gooley called Weston “an extraordinary jazz pianist” influenced by Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk. “There (are) a lot of great players <span class="s1">who are not well known as composers, but he’s known as both.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Weston said he was deeply interested in traditional African music and how it has influenced music worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “You can see where our culture comes from,” Weston added. “You call it jazz, you call it blues … all those titles. But it’s the African pulse that makes this music so unique and so rich. For me, it’s just a continuation of African civilization, that should have died after the slave trade, but was so beautiful and so powerful it influenced the entire world.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Having travelled to most African countries, Weston has had a long history of playing with and learning from traditional African musicians. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “He was a real pioneer of jazz and African musicians coming together and playing and making a kind of collective musical product out of two traditions that are close but not identical,” Gooley added, noting the importance of Weston’s 1960 suite titled “Uhuru Afrika,” which translates to “Africa Freedom.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“That suite was a statement for the freedom of the African continent during the period of decolonization,” Gooley said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I look at myself as a member of planet Earth. All the music belongs to me, even if I don’t understand it, so I play music from China … from India and all the world. Because in all the world, music is our first language,” Weston said. “It’s like the music teaches you that we’re one planet and one people, despite all of this emphasis on divided human beings.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “In the West, everything is composed,” said Martin Obeng, who has performed and travelled with Weston in the past. “When we come to folk music, that’s totally different. When you listen to blues and many other cultures, it’s not about who composed what, it’s about how the people came together and made that music.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to the concert on Saturday,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Weston will work with the student jazz band. There will also be a lecture by Weston and a screening of a documentary about his life and music on Friday at 3:00 p.m. in the Martinos </span>Auditorium in the Granoff Center.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>List Art Center features artist Carrie Mae Weems</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Upon entering the List Art Center lobby, it is impossible to miss the panoramic series of powerful black and white framed photographs on the walls. Expressive poses and dramatic lighting capture different phases of a woman’s life, all centered around a kitchen table.</p>
<p class="p2">The appropriately titled “Kitchen Table Series” by Carrie Mae Weems will be on display through Dec. 21. It accompanies Weems’ permanent pieces showcased in the gallery.</p>
<p class="p2">Weems, an influential contemporary American artist, is a recipient of the 2015 Ford Fellowship as well as the 2013 MacArthur “Genius Grant.” Her art is shown in renowned museums across the world, including the Tate Museum in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Metropolitan Museum of Art also in New York.</p>
<p class="p2">The exhibit, first shown in 1990, catalyzed the exploration of issues of identity, especially through photography. Jo-Ann Conklin, director of the David Winston Bell Gallery, commented on the innovative and progressive nature of Weems’ work. “It was done in 1990, which is an early period when people were starting to stage photographs,” she said. “As a black woman photographer who was recognized fairly early, (Weems) is very influential on younger artists dealing with race and identity.”</p>
<p class="p2">The series integrates themes on race, class, gender, motherhood and power, with each photograph accompanied by a poetic narrative that combines Weems’ perspective with references to popular songs such as “It’s only a Paper Moon,” written by Yip Harburg and Billy Rose.</p>
<p class="p2">“You can build your own narrative, but she has also supplied a written narrative,” Conklin said, in reference to the accompanying text.</p>
<p class="p2">Weems employs realism in both the photographs and the accompanying texts to create an intimate and universal story. The artist manipulated a single setting to portray everything from romantic relationships, compassionate friendships and maternal love to racism, hardships and individuality. She also challenged the traditional notions of gender roles, as the female protagonist is the breadwinner of the family, and believed motherhood was “a punishment for Eve’s sin,” according to the photograph’s description.</p>
<p class="p2">The evocative images focus primarily on identity. “It shows you her roles as a lover, mother, scholar and a caretaker. That makes it relevant to all of us,” Conklin said.</p>
<p class="p2">To Paola Vasquez ’21, the photograph displaying the heroine with her hands on the table, gazing intently at the camera, was the most powerful. “Throughout the story, she is coming to know who she is,” Vasquez said. “Her experience with a man, friends and having a daughter, they all play a role in that. But who she is, is now solely described by herself.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From the corridor floors to the restroom walls, all the world’s a gallery in the new Engineering Research Center. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The new building features “The Garden in the Brain,” a site-specific, mixed-media collection created by renowned artist Spencer Finch. The collection is comprised of nine pieces, the largest of which is located on the main entry wall and can be viewed from outside through the glass.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The Garden in the Brain” is a “series of tessellation patterns,” which refer to “ancient decorative motifs and modern engineering concepts,” according to a wall plaque in the ERC. The tessellations are interspersed throughout the building and are made of “plywood, glass, </span><span class="s2">ceramic, porcelain and wood finishes.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finch boasts many artistic accomplishments, including the creation of the sole work of art commissioned for the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. He also holds a graduate degree from the Rhode Island School of Design. “We’re really honored to have (art from) an artist of his caliber,” said Jennifer Casasanto, associate dean for programs and planning in the School of Engineering. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the early phases of the project, Finch met with various members of the engineering community, Casasanto said, adding that she was impressed by “how caring and how thoughtful (Finch) was about understanding us.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finch said that in these initial stages he had several useful conversations with Larry Larson, the dean of engineering, during which the two discussed the “intersections between engineering and art that could be a useful area of </span>exploration for the project,” Finch said.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Larson “talked about (how) engineering students are so interested in seeing patterns and … understanding them and how certain patterns and tessellations are ways of visualizing certain engineering concepts,” Finch said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was this idea of patterns that served as Finch’s inspiration. “I had been interested in (patterns) for a long time, especially ancient geometric patterns in tiles and mosaics from the Romans and from the Arabs in Spain and North Africa,” Finch added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Casasanto said that many members of the engineering community have now become “really big fans” of Finch. “It’s amazing to see people walking through the building looking for his art and having conversations about art,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jo-Ann Conklin, director of the David Winton Bell Gallery, described Finch as a “fabulous colorist” and said that his art in the ERC is “totally unique because … it was done specifically for this building and because Spencer has never worked with tessellations before,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another aspect of this project was new: Finch said he had “never done a project where the form of the artwork is so connected to the … purpose of the building.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The art in the ERC was a Percent-for-Art project, an initiative where “1 percent of the construction budget for all new buildings or major renovations” at Brown must be used to commission public art, according to the Public Art at Brown <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/public-art/percent-art">website</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University’s first Percent-for-Art project was Diane Samuels’ “Lines of Sight,” the pedestrian bridge in the Sidney E. Frank Hall for Life Sciences, which was completed in 2006, according to the website. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The budget for Finch’s project, which is the tenth completed Percent-for-Art project at Brown, was greater than past budgets. “Because (of the) many labs in (the ERC, it) is an expensive building, so we had $700,000 for this,” Conklin said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another way Brown obtains public art is through the loan system. Urs Fischer’s “Untitled (Lamp/Bear)” and Giuseppe Penone’s “Idee di Pietra (Ideas of Stone)” are the current pieces on loan. “There are a lot of Brown alums who collect art, and some of them have really extraordinary collections, and so these were folks … (who) offered to lend these pieces to us,” Conklin said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pieces of public art loaned to Brown in the past include Paola Pivi’s “Untitled (Donkey),” which covered three floors of the exterior of the Sciences Library and depicted a donkey standing in a boat, and Orly Genger’s ’01 “You,” which was displayed on the Quiet Green and was 230 feet long and made of recycled lobster <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/10/12/public-art-campus-gains-prominence/">rope</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have compiled, over a short period of time, a really great selection of (public art) works by well-known artists and also others by young, </span>up-and-coming people,” Conklin said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Clad in pink, newest bubble tea outlet opens on Thayer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Offering a novel and colorful ambiance to bubble tea seekers, Vivi Bubble Tea opened mid-November on Thayer Street beneath Ben &amp; Jerry’s. One of the newest additions to Thayer’s culinary scene, Vivi Bubble Tea provides an alternative to Kung Fu Tea and other bubble tea-offering establishments on College Hill.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Upon entrance, customers are immersed in an alarmingly brightly lit, bubble gum pink aesthetic that stretches from floor to ceiling. A large cardboard cutout of the franchise’s mascot — a skeleton draped in a pink tutu and feather boa — greets customers as they enter. The cutout is flanked by posters showcasing the chain’s equally colorful, signature beverages, such as the fluorescent blue and orange “Blue Galaxy.” Vivi’s adds to its playful, childlike ambiance by offering customers games to play while they drink their tea, like Jenga and Hungry Hippos, though the games threaten to topple over drinks.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The menu for bubble tea is extensive, spanning the common categories of milk tea and slush and also including more novel varieties like yakult, a drink with an herbal, medicine-like flavor. The menu itself does not provide descriptions of the drinks or allow for drink customization, forcing customers less familiar with the world of bubble tea to either ask the cashier about the different drinks or risk selecting something unknown. I ordered my usual bubble tea, blended matcha with boba. Compared to the same drink at Kung Fu Tea, it was noticeably less sugary and more fragrant, with notes of rose. Meanwhile, the boba was smaller, sweeter and chewier. Vivi also offers a larger food selection to accompany drinks: the menu features popcorn chicken, cookies and takoyaki, ball-shaped fried octopus dumplings.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite these minor differences, the overall composition of the drinks is comparable to those offered at Kung Fu Tea. Though taste does not deviate largely from that of Kung Fu Tea, Vivi drinks are a tad cheaper. While a medium red bean green tea slush is $4.25 at Kung Fu Tea, it is $4.00 at Vivi’s. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson loves her mother. But she doesn’t like her mother.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The daughter and mother duo, played superbly by Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf, respectively, are constantly at each other’s throats, always bickering and nagging and pushing their relationship toward a fatal precipice. But they are also kindred spirits, albeit contradicting ones. They weave in and out of each other’s lives, slowly revealing themselves as a messy, imperfect and wonderfully human mother-daughter pair. Perhaps, though, “weaving” is too gentle a term for Christine and her mother, Marion. Rather, they explode onto the canvas of their shared life, crashing into each other in a series of cluttered, wearying and ultimately touching interactions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But alas, “Lady Bird” deserves elegiac tributes and immediate consideration for a place amongst the pantheon of cinema’s great bildungsromans. It is also a tour de force from first-time director Greta Gerwig, who also wrote the accompanying screenplay. It’s a lot of responsibility to juggle, but Gerwig manages to get just about everything right: From the clever and perceptive dialogue, to the film’s narrative pacing, to the casting decisions, “Lady Bird” never misses a beat.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Set in an early-2000s Sacramento, CA, the film follows Christine during a senior year of high school befitting her character ­— a whirlwind, dizzy with emotion and prone to impulsive deviations. Gerwig does an exceptional job detailing the year, at times flying madly from one high or low point to the next, only to slow down at each moment to unpack the sensory intricacies of a school play, a dance, or a botched (and ultimately redeemed) prom night. Gerwig also demonstrates a phenomenal eye for understanding how to color in a movie along its margins: One scene involving communion wafers is a particularly inspired showcase of her subtly human touch.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Film critics love to deliberate over the ability of a movie or script to move beyond basic caricatures. We desire that films illustrate more complex and profound human subjectivities. It’s a classic critic’s trope. But we return to that trope for a reason — the successful execution of that ideal is one of cinema’s most triumphant qualities. “Lady Bird” has it in spades. The film expresses a remarkable generosity toward its subjects. Even peripheral characters are given space to articulate a range of humanities. It helps that those parts are driven by strong casting choices that mix veterans like Lois Smith and Tracy Letts with burgeoning stars like Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But “Lady Bird” is built on the performance of Ronan, who beautifully captures the irreverent wit and vivacity of Christine— though she’d really prefer you call her Lady Bird — and Metcalf as her world-weary and tough-loving mother. After Christine struggles with a classic and heartbreaking coming-of-age moment, mother and daughter reenact their Sunday tradition of visiting for-sale high-end houses that they could never afford. Theirs is a thoroughly middle-class family, and to see how the pair live out the fantasy of mobility — and how their financial reality has shaped their relationship — is both tragic and deeply humanizing for both characters. It’s the film’s most quiet and touching scene. Gerwig neither judges nor shies away from portraying the damage Christine and her mother do to one another, ultimately reminding us that their relationship is founded upon an intensely tender love that they often struggle to express. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>BUGS’ ‘Pippin’ carves out its own ‘corner of the sky’</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/26/bugs-pippin-carves-corner-sky/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brown University Gilbert and Sullivan, a student-led theater group, produced a jazzy, intimate take on the acclaimed Broadway musical “Pippin”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that left audiences wide-eyed at the cast’s ability to remain animated throughout the show’s whirlwind of campy choral chaos.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The musical, directed by Ahmed Ashour ’19, ran for four days from Nov. 17 to 20. It followed a romantic, introspective young prince, Pippin, played by Jake Polinksy ’20, on an epic quest to find existential fulfillment, or, in his words, a “corner of the sky.” Pippin’s aspirations for greatness are regularly thwarted by his cruel, cheeky father King Charlemagne (Kevin Madoian ’19), his meddling stepmother Fastrada (Julia Moore ’21 and Annalie Brody ’20) and his “strong and stupid” stepbrother Lewis (Elias Solis ’21), whose sociopathic tendencies make him better suited for the errands of feudal lordship than Pippin, the rightful heir to his father’s throne. The most dynamic character in the ensemble was the flirtatious, scantily clad “Leading Player,” played by Brendan George ’18, who served as the musical’s spiritual coxswain, guiding the audience through the narrative and taking the helm of its many songs and dances. The show was accompanied by the booming 21-person Shadow Orchestra led by musical director and Herald staff writer Shayna Toh ’20.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Ashour’s note to the audience, the cast intended to offer “a more raw perspective (of Pippin) than the glitzy Broadway revival.” Gilbert and Sullivan’s interpretation did a masterful job of staying true to the show’s extravagant theatricality while keeping its content emotionally accessible. Though Polinksy’s lackadaisical, mild-mannered portrayal of Pippin at times made the protagonist seem disengaged, the actors overall did a fabulous job embodying characters that were truly invested in their fates and relationships, regardless of the plot’s frequent tacks toward absurdity. The punchlines — often barbed critiques of religion, capitalism and oppressive institutions — were well executed, and though the script was saturated with sexual innuendo, the crude humor never grew stale. Madoian and Talia Brenner ’19 deserve special mention for outstanding acting and dance, and George’s performance merits acclaim usually reserved for Broadway professionals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Pippin was by and large a success, technical shortcomings occasionally thwarted its coherency, an inevitable repercussion of staging a fully orchestrated musical in the acoustically ill-equipped Alumnae Hall. Between the 21-person orchestra and the heavily-amplified singing, you occasionally had to fight the instinct to muffle your ears, and certain major plot points were lost in the clamor of instrumentals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All earaches aside, the show was so teeming with the oft-mentioned libidinous “magic” that the audience stayed engaged throughout. The wild-eyed players often frolicked through the aisles and addressed audience members, asking them to turn to certain pages in their playbills or inviting them to sing along. Perhaps most amusing was when the show broke the fourth wall with ironic humor, such as when King Charlemagne declared, “Now we sack and pillage!” then winked at the audience and added, “We also have to sing. That’s absolutely essential.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

At first glance, each of her works has the appearance of a classic “whodunit,” all based on a seemingly standard premise: A victim is found murdered; a list of suspects presents itself; a detective is handed the job of solving the case. Yet, as the plot unravels, apparent innocence almost always belies sin and culpability, and the murderer is inevitably the very person you would least expect it to be. Indeed, Christie’s novels employ a paradoxical melange of straightforwardness and complexity, which scorns the expression “innocent until proven guilty” and favors the idea “guilty until proven innocent.”</p>
<p class="p2">Kenneth Branagh’s remake of “Murder on the Orient Express” is the second film adaptation of Christie’s distinguished novel. In terms of plot, Branagh’s adaptation is, for the most part, faithful to the original. World famous detective Hercule Poirot — self-proclaimed as one of the best in the world — finds himself journeying on the Orient Express when one of the passengers on the train is found murdered in their compartment. The train, at this point, is snowbound. There are no visible footprints in the snow and it seems safe to assume that the murderer is one of the remaining passengers on the train. Faced with merely a set of disparate clues and potential suspects, Poirot begins his investigation.</p>
<p class="p2">The most impactful aspect of the film is its cinematic quality. The train is lavishly decorated and the opulence of the set design and the period costume is impressive. The film also boasts a splendid cast, which includes Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer and Johnny Depp. But a lot less splendid is their respective screen time. Aside from Branagh — who takes on the role of Poirot — all the other actors and actresses play rather insignificant parts by comparison.</p>
<p class="p2">As Christopher Orr, senior editor and principal film critic at The Atlantic, put it bluntly, the film may be “visually sumptuous,” but the cast comprises “performers far too gifted to waste their time like this.”</p>
<p class="p2">Another limitation of Branagh’s film is its excess of dramatization. What Christie created as a sophisticated murder mystery has unfortunately been transformed into a sort of action-thriller film, where violence and drama are inserted wherever possible. While it is understandable that a certain amount of dramatization serves to heighten the film’s suspense, excessive violence in this situation trivializes the elegance of Christie’s work.</p>
<p class="p2">The most vexing surprise in the film is the revelation of Poirot’s former beloved, a possibly deceased woman named Katherine, who does not make a single appearance in any of Christie’s novels. Although this was an inconsequential deviation from the plot, it was rather disconcerting and completely out of character to see Poirot periodically fawning over a photograph of this mysterious woman.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite its cringeworthy moments, the film was aesthetically pleasing and moderately enjoyable to watch. Those unacquainted with Christie’s novel may find the film entertaining and the mystery brilliant. More devoted fans of Christie, however, would likely consider the film an unnecessary remake.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The Office of the Chaplains and Religious Life brought artist and activist Amir Sulaiman to campus <span class="s3">Monday night for the annual K. Brooke Anderson Lecture. </span>Sulaiman, a Harvard Fellow who has performed around the world alongside artists including Kanye West and Stevie Wonder, shared “True + Living,” a combined poetry recitation and lecture, with members of the Brown community. His presentation centered on faith and love in the face of contemporary social issues.</p>
<p class="p4">“Whether it’s something in nature, or something in built culture, or some work of art, I find in all of those settings intimations of the sacred, and I also find a lot of spaciousness for people who find dogma or doctrine or tradition too narrow,” said University Chaplain Janet Cooper Nelson. When the multifaith team came together to name the lecturer for this year’s K. Brooke Anderson Lecture, Sulaiman stood out as a speaker whose work at the intersection of art and religion would offer students a spiritual take on the difficult circumstances of today’s cultural climate. Sulaiman takes Muslim theology and applies to it a contemporary and unconventional interpretation, Cooper Nelson added.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">A central role that the Office of the Chaplains and Religious Life plays is to aid students in facing the difficult circumstances of the world, said Adnan Adrian Wood-Smith, the University’s associate chaplain for the Muslim community. He finds in Sulaiman’s work a powerful ability to “address the darkness in the world and yet be helpful and bring in light, in spite of that,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4">“I’m a poet, so I’m going to recite poems. That’s why they brought me here,” Sulaiman began. For a moment, he stood in his dark clothing on a dimly lit stage, facing a nearly silent audience. “You being here is the only thing that’s making this special for me.” Here, Sulaiman’s warm presence brought the auditorium to life. With his statement, he began a conversation. Throughout the night, audience members interrupted his speech to pose their own questions or commentary.</p>
<p class="p4">Sulaiman, who has been Muslim his whole life, included imagery from the Bible and the Quran in the poetry he recited. With a dynamic cadence, he spoke passionately about his spiritual insights, bringing in lines like “miraculous things are happening if you’re awake,” “tell your mind to never mind the unknown” and “the truth is hidden everywhere.”</p>
<p class="p4">In one of his poems, Sulaiman talked about a vanilla sky, a chocolate earth and a caramel girl. He explained the metaphor in that poem, which discussed loving two women, as the challenge he finds in balancing the duality of the physical world and the spiritual realm.</p>
<p class="p4">In addition to reciting poetry, Sulaiman talked about his life as an artist. He spoke about the inspiration he found in hip-hop as a child. He also talked about how his first child, who depended on him in a dangerous world, affected his perspective. “I love you, so therefore I’m afraid,” he said. Sulaiman focused the discussion of his personal life on the act of loving. “Loving is everything, it’s the reason for existence,” he told the audience.</p>
<p class="p4">Sulaiman introduced his last poem as a piece that breaks his heart. In its lines, he addressed what he described as the “tragedy of being black and male and Muslim” and coming to terms with an “America that made me but rejects me at the same time.”</p>
<p class="p4">He finished his presentation with lines that summarized his powerful message, tying together the harsh aspects of the human condition with a spiritual message of hope and possibility. “Through all the battery and all the abuse, we are still so beautiful,” Sulaiman said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Ann Weiner’s creations, personal experiences become shared battles, stories are told in a way words cannot match and generations of women see a part of themselves in the fine details.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Thursday, at the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts’ Cohen Gallery showcased these creations with the opening of its month-long exhibition, Weiner’s “When Caged Birds Sing.” The installation focuses on telling eight women’s personal stories regarding gender-based violence and their triumphs despite adversity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Weiner said she was inspired by the influence that Judy Chicago’s famous exhibition, “The Dinner Party,” had on the writings of feminist author Sue Monk Kidd. “That connection of one artist to the next, honoring women who may not have gotten into the spotlight … triggered me to want to do that for living women who suffered abuse because of their gender and went on to do significant work,” Weiner added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The artwork itself is presented as eight individual sculptures, partitioned by walls bearing each woman’s name and her story. Every sculpture incorporates the image of a woman or the female figure, with materials such as weaponry, caging, wires and netting representing her suffering and metaphorical bondage. Each piece presents a certain grotesqueness that is telling of the urgency of the situations these women faced.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Honor violence, child marriage, female genital mutilation and sex trafficking all play roles in Weiner’s exhibition. The installation also goes into concise detail about the experiences of famous women such as Laverne Cox, American actress and trans rights activist; Maria de Penha, Brazilian domestic violence survivor and advocate; Grace Akallo, a Ugandan escapee of the Lord’s Resistance Army; and Malala Yousafzai, an equal education champion from Pakistan. In her artwork, Weiner attentively adds attributes significant to each woman’s story — toy dolls for Cox, a wedding dress for de Penha, a rifle for Akallo and a red flag for Yousafzai.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I tell the stories of these incredible women in the hope that their voices will be heard, their suffering will be seen and that more of the world will rise up to prevent the abuses they have endured, which are still inflicted on their mothers, sisters and daughters,” Weiner wrote on her website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Weiner said she hopes “(her) work will be … seen by many of the millennia, that the young people will listen to these stories and be moved to do something significant to help women globally and will develop compassion and caring and action.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This sentiment clearly resonated with the audience. One attendee at the opening, Nancy Moore Hulnick, commented that she felt the exhibit helped to “shape … and magnify (her own) voice.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Weiner “picked survivors of abuse, and yet we are all, as women, resonating with this in our own way, big and small,” Moore Hulnick said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students, faculty and community members were treated to a conversation Nov. 14 between artists Melvin Edwards and Tony Ramos to mark the opening of Edwards’ exhibition, “Festivals, Funerals and New Life,” at the List Art Center’s David Winton Bell Gallery. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Edwards is a renowned contemporary sculpture artist with a career spanning five decades. He first showed in a solo exhibition at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in 1965. In 1970, he was the first black sculptor to have a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While first trained as a painter, Edwards was taught the basics of welding by graduate students near the end of his formal education, which changed the direction of his artistic endeavors. “Evolution had taken place and more took place through the years,” Edwards said. In 1963, Edwards created “Some Bright Morning,” the first sculpture in his ongoing and well-known “Lynch Fragment” series. “Some Bright Morning” was “really the first body of work that I thought was mine, independent of the influence of anybody else that I had learned from,” Edwards said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Throughout his work, Edwards has been committed to the themes of African diaspora and black nationalism, as well as industrialization and exploited labor. Much of the exhibition, made from sharp and industrial materials such as barbed wire, chains and pieces of steel, seems to hold tension and frustration. Even absent of titles and the stories behind the pieces’ inspiration, the historical undertones are obvious. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The work doesn’t shy away from … the ugliness of some of the ways in which we’ve structured our society,” said Ian Russell, curator of the exhibition at the Bell Gallery.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tony Ramos, an artist and filmmaker from East Providence, was chosen to moderate Edwards’ talk because they “have been friends and comrades in the arts for over four decades,” Russell said. Ramos and Edwards were both influenced by political movements in Africa in the 1970s. Ramos is “very attuned to storytelling and how one presents or interrogates historical or contemporary narrative,” Russell said. “He knows how to help elicit a strong thread within conversation and dialogue.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The title of the exhibition, “Festivals, Funerals and New Life,” is an extension of the title of a book of poetry by Jayne Cortez, Edwards’s late wife. “He’s very much gesturing to her presence and their collaborative relationship,” Russell said. Before her passing in 2012, Cortez’s last public appearance was at Brown as a participant in the 2011 Chinua Achebe Colloquium on Africa.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following the talk, audience members were welcomed into the gallery space. In one corner, barbed wire hung in long dramatic loops from the ceiling, the loops thinning as they moved out from the corner. The piece is named for a line of poetry by Cortez: “Look through minds mirror distance and measure time.”</span></p>
<p class="p2">This combination speaks to another of Edwards’s primary focuses: language. Ramos described Edwards’s work as its own language. “Serious artists create their own language. You are having these experiences and each experience adds to the vocabulary,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The film “Some Bright Morning: The Art of Melvin Edwards” will be shown in the List Art Center Auditorium Dec. 5, followed by a conversation with the film’s director, Lydie Diakhaté. “Festivals, Funerals and New Life” will show until Feb. 11 in the Bell Gallery.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>StorySlam features seven diverse, captivating tales</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">When Emerson Wells ’18 picked a turtle off the street one Fourth of July weekend several summers ago, he knew little of the turtle’s true potential. It was not until his family entered him into the town’s local turtle race that it became clear that this turtle was exceptional.</p>
<p class="p4">This story and six others received claps, not snaps, at this year’s StorySlam Nov. 17. Not just any claps, either — loud, clamorous applause after every story, punctuated with hoots and hollers of appreciation for each storyteller. Practically each moment in a story that had even a hint of humor was met with an onslaught of laughter from the audience.</p>
<p class="p4">Needless to say, StorySlam is not an event that goes unnoticed or unappreciated in the Brown community. Held in Kassar Fox House, the crowd was pouring in 15 minutes before, and the venue was packed 10 minutes later. Hosted about twice a year by the Storytellers’ club, the event gives seven storytellers the opportunity to present a true story to a large audience — this year’s Friday crowd was around 100 to 125 people.</p>
<p class="p4">From turtle races to cross-country train rides, the stories did not fall under any one category. Sam Reidt ’19 chronicled a particularly engaging tale of being a gay “seven-year veteran of St. Joseph’s Catholic School in Greenville, South Carolina.” After searching for friendship as an insecure middle schooler, he eventually became friends with the “biggest, baddest religion teacher of them all” — before realizing his place after classes was in the “cool liberal teacher clique.”</p>
<p class="p4">Audience member Katie Matora ’19 said she appreciated the visual element of storytelling that one can’t get from reading a story, as well as the bravery of the storytellers.</p>
<p class="p4">“Seeing the expressions on people’s faces when they tell their stories, you can’t fake that. You can’t read that,” she said. “It takes so much courage to speak in front of a crowd and to share something that is important to you or something that you thought is exciting, and I really admire that.”</p>
<p class="p4">Besides Wells and Reidt, Isabelle Doyle’s ’19 story focused on her family’s obsession with telling her that she was born in a Dunkin’ Donuts. Adam Janik ’19.5 relayed the story of his half-finished marathon and Delaney Williams ’19 talked about understanding her relationship with her father. Meanwhile, Julia Tompkins ’18 accidentally obtained “dirty sex money” — her words — and Madison White ’18 went to Disney World, where her mom went to the hospital and a nurse attempted to exact revenge.</p>
<p class="p4">The seven stories this year ranged from humorous to more serious. In the past, comedic stories have typically prevailed.</p>
<p class="p4">“In the past few years, we’ve definitely expanded the range of stories that people will try out with and tell,” said Leah Steans-Gail ’18, an organizer of the event. “We had our first content warning … two years ago.”</p>
<p class="p4">Abby Neill ’19 and Steans-Gail run the Storytellers’ club and the StorySlam. They offer auditions two to three weeks before the event — 20 to 25 auditioned this year, according to Steans-Gail — where anyone with a story or idea can come tell it. Once Neill and Steans-Gail choose the storytellers, they meet with them one-on-one to give feedback. For a full week before the slam, they practice the stories as a group for two hours each night.</p>
<p class="p4">“The stories you see, they’ve changed a lot from the ones most people audition with,” Neill said.</p>
<p class="p4">“A big part of it is time,” Steans-Gail said. “We try to keep it short, because people will leave early and that’s not fair for the storytellers at the end.”</p>
<p class="p4">The storytellers also work on comedic timing and how to get past nervousness, Neill added.</p>
<p class="p4">The StorySlam wrapped up in about an hour and twenty minutes, and the crowd left in high spirits. Though Kassar Fox House is small, as everyone stood up to leave, it was clear how many had packed into the room to listen to the stories.</p>
<p class="p4">And, by the way, Wells’ turtle won the turtle race — out of over 1,000 turtles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Orchestra concert to feature Russian composers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s3">Despite a recent and abrupt change in leadership, the Brown University Orchestra sounded cohesive and melodic while rehearsing in Sayles Hall Monday evening for their upcoming concert. Entitled “The Russian Connection,” the concert will feature three pieces reflecting both stable and volatile eras in Russian history. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When creating a concert repertoire, Daniel Harp, teaching associate in music and interim conductor, considers the history behind each piece and develops a theme for the evening. With his emphasis on historical setting, Harp said he hopes his musicians not only learn their music but “live with it and make it their quest to understand its tone.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With three pieces by composers Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Modest Mussorgsky and Dmitri Shostakovich — composed in vastly different time periods yet connected through a shared Russian history — the program is an ambitious undertaking. Each piece embodies the epoch in which it was written. Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky, as Romantic period contemporaries, wrote during imperialist Russia, a relatively stable era. Tchaikovsky’s “Romeo and Juliet,” composed in 1869, is based on William Shakespeare’s play. Mussorgsky’s “The Khovansky Affair,” an opera, was written in the 1870s about political upheaval in 1682. The most contemporary work in the trio, Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5 in D minor, was composed in 1937 in Soviet Russia during the height of Josef Stalin’s purges — and the music reflects it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “The first two pieces are sweet and romantic, but Shostakovich’s symphony is dark and heavy, almost like you’re bearing this intense burden as you listen to it. But that’s the orchestra’s favorite style of music to play,” said Irene Tang ’19, concertmaster.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These pieces, while telling a musical history of Russia, have greater implications in the context of U.S. politics, Harp said. “As I listen to Shostakovich’s music, I hear it as a warning about political upheaval and the suppression of ideas that were pervasive in Soviet Russia,” he said. “It’s a warning about controlling the press, controlling the arts; it is really a cautionary tale of the kind of totalitarian ideology that can infiltrate a democracy.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since their last performance in October, the orchestra has seen a lot change — and an upheaval of their own. When Harp stepped in to replace former conductor Brandon Keith Brown after his sudden departure from his position, he not only had to quickly assemble the repertoire for the upcoming November concert, but also had to reunify the fractured orchestra. The orchestra recruited new students and urged musicians who left during Keith Brown’s brief tenure to return, according to Orchestra President Katie Rademacher ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the University searches for a permanent conductor, Rademacher is optimistic about the future of the orchestra. “We’ve all moved on,” she stated. “We’ve grown a lot closer, moods have been really high and we are (playing) really fun and exciting music. There will not be a dull moment in this concert.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The concert will be held Thursday, Nov. 30 and again Friday, Dec. 1 at 8 p.m. in Sayles Hall.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">On Friday night, the Poler Bears performed the “Nightmare Before Christmas,” their third annual holiday-themed show at The Dark Lady nightclub in downtown Providence. The show was highly successful, drawing large crowds to watch members of the Ivy League’s first pole dancing club perform numbers that they had choreographed themselves.</p>
<p class="p4">Half an hour before doors opened, a line had already formed outside The Dark Lady. Showgoers stood eagerly in the frigid cold, excited to see the Poler Bears’ newest performance. Inside, the theme was apparent, with tinsel snowflakes hanging from the ceiling and wrapped presents on the base of the dancing poles. Over blaring music, audience members danced and chatted amongst themselves for almost an hour while some of the Poler Bears improvised choreography on poles before the actual show commenced.</p>
<p class="p4">The show was comprised of solo performances by each of the club’s members, as well as a few duets. A performer in drag clad in jolly holiday garb directed the festivities, reading each Poler Bear’s self-written introduction between numbers. The numbers spanned a variety of choreography styles, from those cabaret-inspired to others with acrobatic influences. The show culminated grandly in a sensational performance by Adam Moreno ’18 in tall platform black combat boots to Madonna’s “Like A Prayer” as a smoke machine blasted vapor across the stage. The crowd went wild.</p>
<p class="p4">“The final act blew me away,” said Kate Callahan ’21. Moreno “just had so much stage presence.”</p>
<p class="p4">The more casual nightclub setting marked a departure from the Poler Bears’ usual campus venues, like Alumnae Hall or Production Workshop’s Upspace, said Moreno, the club’s president. “The audience we’re allowed to have (in The Dark Lady) is much bigger, … so it’s been great to have more people come to our shows.”</p>
<p class="p4">“All of our friends are here (tonight); it’s an incredibly supportive environment,” said Julia Tompkins ’18, the club’s social chair. “This is a really earnest team (with) people who are committed to honing their craft but also really like having fun together.”</p>
<p class="p4">“We’ve really strengthened as a team, … in terms of prioritizing bonding and social activities because there’s such a steep learning curve,” Moreno said. “This year, we haven’t had anyone drop, and I’ve noticed the team (to be) a lot closer.”</p>
<p class="p4">The group prides itself in its diversity in both skill level and body type, Moreno said. “We take people of all backgrounds. We don’t use (pole dancing experience) as a requirement.” People choreograph their own material and can perform whatever they want to, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Axel Getz ’18, a member of the Poler Bears for four years, said, “I’m really excited about my parents coming. They haven’t seen (me perform) since I was a freshman. … They’re in for a fantastic show.”</p>
<p class="p4">Since the club’s founding in 2006, its main goal has been to destigmatize pole dancing through an emphasis on the activity’s athleticism, artistry and the empowerment of performers themselves, Moreno said. “A lot of people … have some sort of stigma (associated with pole dancing), … but if anyone comes to one of our shows, that’s immediately erased,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">The Poler Bears’ performance also commemorated World AIDS day, and The Dark Lady invited AIDS Care Ocean State to provide free HIV testing at the event, Moreno said.</p>
<p class="p4">The performance was an “out-of-body experience,” said Bryan Olivo ’20. “That was incredible.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>End-of-semester RISD exhibition showcases students’ multimedia artwork</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Twelve: The 17th Annual Advanced Projects Juried Exhibition” will take place Dec. 7 at the Rhode Island School of Design’s Illustrations Studies Building Gallery. The exhibition, which is hosted by RISD’s illustration department, will feature an eclectic array of artwork created by 12 students enrolled in RISD’s “Advanced Projects” class.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The course, taught by RISD illustration department Senior Critic Leonard Long, requires each student to create one project with a theme of their choosing, which is ultimately featured at the exhibition at the end of the semester. The class proved challenging for students, as Long demands an incredible quality and quantity of work from its participants, said Sohum Chokshi ’18,who is taking the class at RISD. “We were actually going to call the show ‘Miles Before We<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sleep.’” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the taxing nature of the course, students are animated about the upcoming exhibition. “It’s going to be amazing,” said RISD student Paul Meuser, who is a part of the “Advanced Projects” class and is studying illustration. Unlike a traditional art exhibition “where you walk around in silence,” “Twelve” will have a dynamic, lively atmosphere, Meuser added. There will be “music, food (and) a ton of people,” and viewers will have the opportunity to engage with the artists, he explained. “It’s just a more fun way to experience the art.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Due to the open-ended nature of the assignment, students have chosen to express themselves through many forms of media. The exhibition will feature artwork ranging from paintings and comics to animations and sculptures. In addition to the wide range of media, the artwork also explores a diverse array of themes. RISD student Liby Hays, a comic artist, described how her project, which centers on conversations between three hikers — an overachiever, a flippant individual and a mediator — explores the relationship between talent, ingenious and ambition. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, a lot of the other comic works focus on issues of gender and sexuality, Hays said. Comics are “a great space for queer people to explore their narratives, without having to have a high budget,” she reflected. Other projects featured in the exhibition include a mixed-media animation on space and a series of paintings that explore albinism within the context of an African-American cultural identity, Meuser noted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The purpose of the exhibition is two-fold: It allowed students to showcase their work and build their resume while also teaching them how to put on a show and make it look as professional as possible, Chokshi said. Each student is assigned a role — such as curator, jury and organizer, among others — and together, the students run the entire gallery. “It gives us a taste of how the real world works,” Chokshi said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Photojournalist and educator Mary Beth Meehan has made a life out of telling other peoples’ narratives. Enticed early-on by photography, Meehan has worked to use the medium to bind communities together and to empower marginalized voices. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I fell in love with photographs way before I ever realized I could become a speaker of them,” Meehan said. “As a kid, I always loved my family photos and would just spend forever gazing at their still-images.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But it was only after a summer college internship in journalism that Meehan began conceiving of photography as a way of making a living. “I worked for a small, low-budget paper one summer during college, and that experience really cemented my affinity for photography,” she said. “While my bosses liked the stories I was writing, what really stuck with them were the photos I took to accompany the articles.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This epiphany blossomed into a full-blown career pivot to photojournalism. “Before that, I didn’t realize you pull off photography as a career. I realized that being a photojournalist meant doing photography in a way that was actually rooted in the world,” Meehan said. “That led me to eventually complete a Master of Arts in photojournalism at the University of Missouri.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After completing her master’s, Meehan charted a course back to New England with the intention of expressing her community’s narratives and cultural diversity. Her on-going project “Seen/Unseen” epitomizes this artistic mission, comprising a series of photographs and correspondent written narratives that encapsulate the lives of Providence citizens. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Documented on her blog and banners across downtown Providence, the photographic installation works to “interrogate the process of trying to represent others,” according to Meehan’s website, aspiring to advance community-binding dialogue and to illicit intimately profound insights for viewers into the lives of the subjects portrayed. These subjects encompass and span various identities, giving space to Marina, a woman from the East Side’s Elmside enclave of Orthodox Jews, Thuan, a Vietnamese immigrant tortured by Cambodian soldiers and others that make up the Providence community.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Seen/Unseen” has grown considerably since its 2015 inception. Meehan has come to be backed by grants funded sources that range from the municipal level — the Rhode Island Council for the Humanities — to the federal level — the National Endowment for the Arts. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The city of Providence’s Department of Art, Culture and Tourism actually got funding from the NEA for the project. The process of receiving funding was very organic since Providence has a really evolved set of creative stakeholders,” Meehan said. “You don’t just get to hang big banners of your work in any city.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The project has extended past Providence’s borders to Newnan, Georgia, which has a public installation analogous to Providence’s planned for 2019 according to Meehan’s blog. “I employed the same framework I use in all of my work during my time in Newnan,” Meehan said. “Tons of conservations and observations that aim to get at the heart of whatever ecosystem I’m photographing” — a methodology of communal art that Meehan stressed throughout her recent artist-in-residency at Stanford University.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I taught a six-week master-class at Stanford for undergraduates in photography and fine arts. The goal was to get past the headlines of what Silicon Valley is about,” Meehan said. “What was immediately apparent to me in that ecosystem was how so many people live on the fringe of socioeconomic security there due to the exorbitant real estate — even those with high-paying salaries.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the pedagogy Meehan most enjoys taking part in happens not in university lecture halls, but in third grade classrooms. Meehan has extended her fondness for narrative-telling to the bilingual third-graders of Pawtucket’s International Charter School. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’ve taught at the ICS for almost ten years now, teaching children the same modes of photojournalism I taught students at Stanford and (the Massachusetts College of Art and Design),” Meehan said. “We host three exhibitions a year where the kids take part in exhibitions capturing their lives. Ultimately, their body of work feels (like) a part of my body of work.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">This Friday, the Brown Wind Symphony and Oxford University Wind Orchestra will team up for a joint concert in Sayles Hall. The Brown Percussion Ensemble will open the concert with a performance conducted by Kevin Plouffe, teacher of percussion in the applied music program. A portion of the concert will feature a section exclusively conducted by Matthew McGarrell, director of bands and senior lecturer in music, and another will showcase the Oxford University Wind Orchestra, conducted by Chloe Rooke, the director of the Oxford Wind Orchestra. The two ensembles will then come together for two combined pieces at the end, “Serenade” by Derek Bourgeois and “Minho e Galiza,” a Portuguese March by Miguel de Oliveira.</p>
<p class="p4">Oxford’s visit to the University is a leg of the wind orchestra’s U.S. tour, where they have scheduled performances and workshops with a number of universities, including Princeton and Cornell. According to Rooke, this is the first time the OUWO is doing a full East Coast tour since its founding in 1974 and the first time the ensemble will play with the Brown Wind Symphony.</p>
<p class="p4">The concert has a “‘crossing the pond’ sort of theme,” Rooke said, with the Oxford ensemble performing pieces by British composers and Brown’s symphony performing only American pieces. McGarrell chose not to select British composers, in response to Rooke’s selection of works. “I thought … if they’re going to do all English, we’re not going to do Holst, we’re not going to do Ralph Vaughan Williams. … It ended up being a nice contrast, I think the audience will enjoy the different approaches,” said McGarrell.</p>
<p class="p4">The University’s portion of the concert focuses on three pieces by California-based composer Frank Ticheli and also includes a small ensemble piece and one percussion ensemble.</p>
<p class="p4">“What’s interesting about Ticheli is that even his pieces intended for middle school or high school bands are really great music (and) really fun to play,” McGarrell said. Alexander Perl ’18 will perform a clarinet solo in Ticheli’s virtuosic “Blue Shades,” according to McGarrell.</p>
<p class="p4">The OUWO is performing “Atlantic Alliance,” a new work that was written this term specifically for their wind orchestra, by Colin Touchin, founder of the ensemble. This piece is followed by another British work, “East Coast Pictures” by Nigel Heff. “Nigel Heff and Colin Touchin are both key wind orchestra figures in the U.K.,” Rooke said.</p>
<p class="p4">While many band conductors choose pop music to perform, this program has “real concert music,” McGarrell said.</p>
<p class="p4">There’s excitement among both wind symphonies for the opportunity to collaborate. “I think it’s going to end up being a great concert. I think we’re all going to have a lot of fun,” said Amanda Siegel ’19, who plays the flute and piccolo in the wind symphony. The two ensembles performing together will count about 90 performers, “so that’s going be a lot of sound, a lot of music,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“All of us are really excited to be able to meet other like-minded students. … Music is such a powerful tool to form bonds with people, because it’s such a communicative vessel,” Rooke said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>“A Night at Sea” full of outrageous laughs, devilish fun</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Brown’s Out of Bounds sketch comedy team hosted its “A Night at Sea” performance Saturday night in front of a boisterous crowd at MacMillan Hall. If the group’s performance was any indication of life on the high seas, sign me up for the next vessel leaving Providence harbor.</p>
<p class="p4">Of course, the sketches didn’t actually have anything to do with seamanship or nautical minutiae — not a single sketch even occurred at sea (with the exception of the opening vignette, which largely served to introduce the team’s new cast members). Nevertheless, every sketch was a compact display of creative genius and showmanship. “A Night at Sea” was awash with uproarious highlights.</p>
<p class="p4">So where does one even begin?</p>
<p class="p4">I’ll start in the middle of the show, with a sketch that left me in a fit of gleeful spasms. Emily Adams ’18 stars as a Bogart-esque film noir detective, complete with a cigarette and trench coat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She has arrived at an unnamed office for a job interview but bewilders the interviewer and audience with a seemingly deranged series of cocksure overtures. She is convinced the man she is investigating is hiding inside of the office’s filing cabinet. In a wonderful reveal that subverts the audience’s expectations of the absurd, we learn that this man is in fact hiding in the filing cabinet. The detective role requires a committed and inspired performance, which Adams offers in spades. It’s a perfect marriage of great writing and acting: The sketch captures the noir detective trope’s wacky and antiquated vernacular cadences, and Adams nailed the delivery.</p>
<p class="p4">Other highlights included “Gary,” the hilariously out-of-place and inappropriate druggy clown auditioning to play a superhero in a sanitized production meant for child viewers. Chautaqua Ordway ’20<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>gave a standout performance as Gary in his inaugural show with the sketch company. A sketch about a visual arts class in which the day’s nude model is a little too familiar with the artists is similarly entertaining. Moreover, the model sketch demonstrates the writers’ great sense of comedic life-span: the joke which the scene is centered around is funny to a point, and the team moves on just before the humor grows stale.</p>
<p class="p4">Indeed, time and space are not wasted in “A Night at Sea.” The Out of Bounds team manages to mine humor from just about every walk of life and scenario — from an imaginative soccer goalie to a gonzo Career Lab professional to the SAT to the Boston Tea Party. They built so much comedic trust over the course of the show that I was almost disappointed if every upcoming sketch didn’t surpass the previous one in laughs. That’s about the only complaint I can muster — “A Night at Sea” was a fabulous lark.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Holiday a capella performance features Bear Necessities, Higher Keys</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Metcalf Auditorium played host Saturday night to the “Beary Keys,” the pithily named annual holiday performance put on by the Bear Necessities and the Higher Keys.</p>
<p class="p4">As the “Beary” half of the Beary Keys, the Bear Necessities described themselves as “Brown’s only all-male, all-suspendered a cappella group, and we love it.” The Higher Keys call themselves “Brown’s oldest all-gender a cappella group” with a repertoire comprised of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>jazz, pop and R&amp;B.</p>
<p class="p4">Indeed, Saturday’s performance demonstrated the fruits of an organic and endearing partnership, as the “Beary Keys” proved to be a conclusively pleasant affair. After a rather uninspired opening, the show found its stride and peaked with a collaborative production of a “God Rest Ye’ Merry Gentleman” / “Carol of the Bells” medley.</p>
<p class="p4">The Bear Necessities — yes, decked out in suspenders —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>kicked off the proceedings with an understated performance of “Carry on My Wayward Son.” It was admittedly off-putting to begin what was billed as a holiday show with a minimalist rendition of the Kansas rock classic. The attire didn’t help matters either, as only one member of the group managed to procure a Santa hat.</p>
<p class="p4">The Higher Keys took the stage next, wearing a simple array of red and black (with one member donning a stray pair of reindeer antlers). The Keys opened with an adaptation of Charlie Brown’s “Christmas Time is Here,” a curious choice given the song’s dreary tone. However, a brief solo scat performance at the end of the song seemed to wake both the show and audience from their stupor. Indeed, the Keys followed with a downright impish rendition of the classic Christmas duet, “Baby It’s Cold Outside.” While not the strongest harmonic performance, “Baby It’s Cold Outside” was refreshingly entertaining, engaging and self-aware in its silliness. The Keys even included a cheeky nod to Ella Fitzgerald’s famous “Mack The Knife” gaffe, as they pretended (I think?) to bungle and forget the lyrics to the second half of the song.</p>
<p class="p4">Taking their cue from the Keys, the Bears returned with a stronger and livelier second act. After an entertaining first tune, they pulled from the more religiously-oriented tradition of Christmas carols, singing a birth of Christ anthem that was immediately the concert’s most harmonically precise and elegant performance.</p>
<p class="p4">The Keys began their second act with Joni Mitchell’s “River.” Keys president Rebecca Cheng ’18 proved to be a stirring triumph as the solo voice in the a cappella adaptation. Her hauntingly beautiful performance evoked the somber nostalgia that provides the emotional undercurrent to the holiday season.</p>
<p class="p4">As expected, the “Beary Keys” concluded with a collaboration between the two groups. The aforementioned medley opened subtly before revealing its more energetic character, replete with feet stamping and a beatboxing performance. The Bears and Keys fit neatly together, with alto and soprano voices floating over a baritone foundation that displayed real substance and depth. The medley delighted the audience, providing a rising conclusion to a largely mature and successful concert. I left the auditorium with only one question unanswered — what took “Beary Keys” so long to get going?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">With students’ eyes focused on the performers on stage, the audience is sometimes forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Herald’s spring 2016 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/04/14/spring-2016-poll-results-and-methodology/">poll</a> found that those who attend arts events most frequently tend to be non-first-generation students and mostly white students.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think that a lot more needs to be done by way of outreach or inclusion,” said Zach Silberberg ’18, a member of IMPROVidence, an improvisational comedy group, and a Herald illustrator.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to poll results, 11.5 percent of first-generation students have never been to an arts event, compared to 7.3 percent of non-first-generation students. About half of white students attend arts events at least once a month, whereas about 40 percent of students of color attend with the same frequency.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">More and more, cost and accessibility has become less of an issue, said Yolanda Rome, associate dean for first-year and sophomore studies. Many arts organizations have made a concerted effort to eliminate these boundaries.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’ve found ways to get tickets to low-income and first-gen students,” said Patricia Ybarra, chair of theatre arts and performance studies. Production Workshop and Musical Forum do not charge for performances, and Sock and Buskin has launched initiatives to get tickets to first-generation students.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Part of the discrepancy could have to do with the fact that much of the appeal of arts events is attending with friends, Rome said. Often, first-generation students tend to “seek each other out, so they can understand and talk about their experience with other people who share their perspective,” she added. When first-generation students do not see their friends attending arts events, they might not go either.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Valentin Perez ’18 speculated that the disparity had to do with the way the materials were advertised or worded.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Making sure that the people represented in the pictures are diverse, from different races and socioeconomic classes — it lets them know that it’s something that people like them (would want to) go to,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Still, while 10 percent of white students reported attending arts events once a week, only 5 percent of students of color reported attending arts events as often.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In light of this discrepancy, some groups have made strides to increase diversity within their groups.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m so proud of our group right now because in regards to gender and to race, over the last two years we have brought in amazingly talented and funny people that are not just white men, and this is reflected in the audience,” Silberberg said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Benjamin Hayslett-Ubell ’18.5, a member of Out of Bounds Sketch Comedy, echoed this sentiment. “Now there is a more conscious effort to make the space more inclusive,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In March, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/01/diversity-initiatives-make-strides-comedy-scene/">The Herald</a> wrote about how those from diverse backgrounds navigate the comedy space at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The sorts of conversations about how gender and race and class have influence even on a group of friends are conversations happening,” Hayslett-Ubell said. “They’re really hard sometimes, but these conversations must take place.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hayslett-Ubell and Silberberg noted that often those attending events reflect the demographics of the performers. “We’re inviting the people in our friend groups,” Silberberg said. “And when there are these same circles, it’s going to end up being the same people.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the same vein, Silberberg said: “You’re going to see a lot of the same people going to the same events. This is something that can and should change. … We publicize events on Facebook, (and use) posters — but for the most part, this needs to be better.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The content of arts events might also shape their audiences.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“A variety of topics would be interesting ­— beyond the usual Broadway, Eurocentric topics,” said Samanee Mahbub ’19.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For many arts groups, creating a platform for people of color has become an important goal, Ybarra said. By diversifying content, arts groups have attempted to make their events more visibly accessible. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Last year, we produced a number of shows written by playwrights of color (and) often directed by directors of color. One of the reasons people go to arts events is to see their stories on stage and commitment to telling stories from a diversity of perspectives diversifies your audience,” Ybarra added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Last year’s production of “In the Heights” drew in an overwhelming response from the Latinx community and beyond, she noted. The sold-out show stands as a testament to the progress in diversifying the arts across campus, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Even if the arts community and the comedy scene is diversifying naturally, there always needs to be a conscious effort to say that this should not just be a space for white people,” Silberberg said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As students prepare to transition from finals to festivities, The Herald has compiled a list of holiday favorites, which will transport you anywhere from the North Pole to Hogwarts. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a family watch party: “Elf” (2003) — “Elf” is a favorite featuring Will Ferrell as a man raised by Santa and his elves at the North Pole. Traveling to New York City to find his biological father, Ferrell’s character, Buddy, engages in hilarious antics, falls in love and spreads Christmas joy throughout the city. The movie is perfect if<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>you want to experience all the festivity of a New York City Christmas vicariously through Buddy the Elf.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the kid at heart: “Home Alone” (1990) — This instant classic is sure to put you in the holiday spirit. Follow 8-year-old Kevin McCallister through a series of hijinks as he attempts to navigate life during the holidays while separated from his family. Though most have seen the first “Home Alone,” you may not know that the movie kicked off a five-part franchise. Unfortunately, not all of the following movies feature the same cast of characters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a sing-along: “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” (1966) — Reminisce about holidays past and join the Whos of Whoville, the Grinch and his adorable dog Max with this classic 25-minute cartoon. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a watch party with friends: “Love, Actually” (2003) — This well-loved romantic comedy unites an all-star cast through multiple romantic, platonic and problematic stories. The film is set in London during the month preceding Christmas. If you’ve seen “Love, Actually” more times than you can count, the BBC ONE recently released a 15-minute video allowing fans to check in on the characters in the present day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For those who don’t care about originality: “New Year’s Eve” (2011) — If you are looking for something similar to “Love Actually,” you might try this film, which also relies on a cast of recognizable faces and multiple stories that come together at the end through various interpersonal connections. This time, the setting is New Year’s Eve in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the romantic: “The Holiday” (2006)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— This romantic comedy stars Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black. Diaz and Winslet’s characters swap houses and fall in love while on their respective trips. It’s the perfect movie to watch if you’re looking for something light and romantic with a wintry setting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For someone in search of a new holiday favorite: “The Family Stone” (2005) ­— A mix of drama, comedy, tragedy and romance, “The Family Stone” features another star-studded cast, which includes Sarah Jessica Parker, Rachel McAdams, Diane Keaton and Claire Danes. The film deals with issues that arise when Sarah Jessica Parker’s uptight character is introduced to her new boyfriend’s family. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the eternal believer: “The Santa Clause” (1994) — This 90s favorite combines magic and reality, as a young boy, Charlie, watches his father, Scott Calvin, gradually become the next Santa Claus as a result of a mishap on Christmas eve. While the first is by far the best, the later two films in the trilogy provide more options if you’re looking to binge watch Christmas movies. The second and third were released in 2002 and 2006, respectively, and portray life in the North Pole with Charlie as a teenager.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the Amtrak lover: “The Polar Express” (2004) — This artfully animated film follows a group of children to Santa’s Workshop via a magical and mysterious ride on the “Polar Express” train.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the lover of classics: “It’s a Wonderful Life” (1946) — The top-rated holiday movie on Rotten Tomatoes (with a 94 percent fresh rating), this film is “worth an annual viewing,” according to the site’s critics. With a moving plot, the film grapples with the influence a single person can have on the greater world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the bookworm: Harry Potter movies (2001-2011) — Winter break is the perfect opportunity to watch all seven Harry Potter films, which should take you slightly less than 20 hours total. Significant holiday moments include the first film’s depiction of 11-year-old Harry and Ron spending Christmas together at Hogwarts and the fourth film’s Yule Ball during the Triwizard tournament.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As finals loom and winter break approaches, sweet treats and warm drinks become all the more welcome. Whether you’re seeking a coffee shop perfect for studying or a sweet treat getaway, Providence cafes offer countless opportunities to indulge. Many of these restaurants are already student favorites, but with winter specials, they’re worth giving another look.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes, a sweet treat or caffeine pick-me-up is needed to get through a long day of studying. If you find yourself searching for one, don’t hesitate to try out one of these places.</p>
<p class="p1">Dave’s Coffee, popular for its modern decor, available seating and coffee and espresso bar, has now rotated into its winter menu. While their classics — such as the Classic Breakfast Sandwich and the Avocado Toast — remain, new items, such as the grab-and-go Winter Soba Noodle Salad, have been added. In the top shelf of their pastry case, Dave’s features a new gingersnap sandwich cookie with orange cream filling as part of the winter menu. Pair it with your morning (or evening) coffee for a motivational treat. Dave’s, located on South Main Street, is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. Dave’s Hot Cocoa is $3 for a small (8 oz.), and $3.50 for a large (12 oz.).</p>
<p class="p1">The Thayer Street staple Tealuxe offers customizable tea-infused hot chocolate. Flavors include spicy chai and spearmint. One current special at Tealuxe is the Holiday Milk Tea, which includes a combination of gingerbread, cinnamon, vanilla and caramel black teas. With counter seating along the windows and small booth-style tables, Tealuxe — open until 10 p.m. daily — offers a cozy environment to settle into for a long day of studying. Tealuxe’s tea-infused Hot Cocoa is $4.69 for the regular size (16 oz.) and $5.19 for the large (20 oz.)</p>
<p class="p1">Sydney Providence, a six-minute walk from Providence Place Mall, serves as the perfect destination for a holiday shopping break or for a weekday study session. Open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, Sydney boasts a large pastry and drink selection, as well as lunch and brunch items. Sydney’s holiday specials include the peppermint bark latte, topped with whipped cream, and new macaroon flavors such as gingerbread and white chocolate peppermint. Sydney’s hot chocolate is $3.62 for the small (12 oz.), and $3.95 for the large (16 oz.).</p>
<p class="p1">Small Point Cafe, downtown on Westminster street, similarly offers a wide selection of food and drink options. With four large booths and plenty of small tables in the main dining area, the cafe has space for those looking to study alone or with a small group. If you’re striving to be adventurous in your coffee choice, go for their seasonal drink: the rosemary brown sugar latte. If you’re lucky, your barista might go beyond the classic latte art, creating animals or festive designs. Located across the street from the Vault Collective, a vintage clothing shop, and Craftland, a store featuring work by over 100 artists, and not too far from Providence Place Mall, Small Point is another great place to stop after shopping. Small Point’s Hot Cocoa is $2.25 for the small (12 oz.) and $2.95 for a large (16 oz.).</p>
<p class="p1">If you desire a sit-down environment for your holiday treat, Pastiche, located on Federal Hill, has a wide variety of cakes, tarts and pastries available. Open until 11:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday nights, Pastiche offers cafe seating with table service, perfect for indulging in a slice of dutch apple pie or raspberry almond cake. Their selection of cakes and pastries, including cannolis, eclairs, brownies, muffins and scones, are are also available to-go. The hot chocolate at Pastiche is $2.75 for the small (8 oz.), and $3.75 for the large (16 oz.).</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tropical Smoothie Cafe brings healthy options to Thayer Street</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Catering to just about every frozen fruit fantasy under the sun, Tropical Smoothie Cafe opened in the once-vacant lot above the Soban Korean Eatery on Thayer Street on Jan. 14. While a long list of “Supercharged” and “Superfood” smoothies appease the Cafe’s health-conscious patrons, it also offers a selection of “Indulgent” smoothies like the “Chia Banana Cacao” and the “Bahama Mama,” which contain sweets such as chocolate, peanut butter, and other guilty pleasures. Customers looking to grab lunch on the go might be enticed by the Cafe’s “Smoothie and a Half” deal: a smoothie as well as a half of a sandwich for $7.99. This will be the second Tropical Smoothie Cafe in the University’s vicinity, joining an older location on Waterman Street. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The (Waterman) location is more for people who are ‘on the go’ and need a quick meal for lunch,” said Devin McKeever, the manager of both the Thayer and Waterman locations. “This new (location) will provide college students with a nice place to hang out and study and drink smoothies.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The new location is already popular among Brown students. “We have a couple of athletic teams that have been regulars so far,” McKeever added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I love smoothies, and before this new location opened, it was hard to find them around here,” said Signe Burchim GS, a Cafe customer and first-year grad student who used to frequent the Cafe’s Waterman location. “I’m very excited that the new location is closer to campus” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There was clearly a lack of smoothies on Thayer Street, and now there’s a place for exactly that — smoothies,” said Julia Rosenfeld ’19. “They’re surprisingly fairly priced,” Rosenfeld added, tempering her enthusiasm of the store with some censure of the smoothies’ likely high sugar content. “Those smoothies are so intimidatingly large — there’s no way they could be healthy...”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When asked about the reasoning behind the University property’s new allocation of Tropical Smoothie Cafe, John Luipold, Brown’s assistant vice president of real estate, said, “The space that Tropical Smoothie Cafe now occupies on Thayer was once a bar, and we did not want to add another bar to Thayer Street.” Thayer previously played host to the Shark Bar and Grille across the street from the now Tropical Smoothie Cafe.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We wanted to have something that was a little more family-friendly and easier to manage, frankly,” Luipold said. “We just thought that Tropical Smoothie Cafe would be great for not only Brown students but also for families in the neighborhood and visitors coming to Brown.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Cafe will join the ranks of other health-conscious options on Thayer, such as by CHLOE and Pokéworks. “It’s a relatively healthy alternative to some of the other fare on Thayer,” said Luipold.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There’s a lot of change going on in the retail community and a lot of it is that older business models that used to work are not as popular as they used to be,” Luipold said, in reference to the recently closed Au Bon Pain’s business plan. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Is it better to do the right thing, even if it might be the wrong thing for you personally?” writes alum Peter Rush ’71 in his novel “Wild World.” The novel follows his protagonist, Steven Logan, as he struggles to make a change in a climate defined by political and social tension. Students will have a chance to hear from Rush firsthand on Feb. 1 at 6 pm,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>when he discusses and signs his book at the Brown Bookstore.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“Wild World” by Peter Rush is set in the 1970s — an era rife with protests, scandals and the turbulence triggered by the Vietnam War. Despite this omnipresent chaos, Logan, a senior at Brown, initially appears to lead a well-structured, idealistic life. On the threshold of entering law school at Georgetown, he is protected inside the bubble of elite academia alongside his girlfriend.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Although “Wild World” is a fascinating read, its opening is admittedly disappointing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The characters initially appear to lack nuance and the casual writing style — though accessible — is slightly stilted. But the story soon gains momentum. The plot acquires depth, the characters gain complexity and the conversational narrative assumes an easy flow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Indeed, the remainder of the novel is nothing short of engaging. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When four students at Kent State are shot by the National Guard during a protest, Logan experiences an outburst of ardent anger and shock. Convinced that he can single-handedly purge the system from within, Logan decides to defer his plan for law school and join the Providence Police instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4">From there, his life alters drastically, as he finds himself trapped between two worlds but belonging to neither.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The incongruity of his presence in the police force is unmistakable. Likewise, the rampant corruption inside the system disgusts him. Meanwhile, he grows estranged from his college friends, who begin to view him as one with the establishment — a symbol of the enemy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The story is on the cusp of this fault line of ideals as Logan grapples to navigate the harshness of reality.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rush’s landscape is carefully constructed. Interspersed with vivid snapshots of the political, cultural and social climate, the novel captures the zeitgeist of the 1970s with absolute candor and exhaustive detail. The portrayal of the mood on university campuses — specifically Brown’s campus — has a distinct flavor of authenticity that likely stems from his personal college experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Illustrations of College Hill permeate the story, remarkably delineating the spirit of Brown. While the novel may be set nearly half a decade ago, Rush is successful in capturing an essence of the campus that continues to linger today.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Wild World” often invites the reader to meditate on philosophical questions that have a timeless relevance. For instance, Rush considers how students in elite academic institutions live a life of illusions, isolated from the brutal outside world. “Do you have any idea how unreal this academic world is?” he questions. “What is the real human condition? Why are the people exploited? Why don’t we all live in harmony? Why, why?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At times, his ruminations may appear a bit harsh. He characterizes elite academia as a bubble where “parents pay the bills and the kids pretend to have all the answers” in stark contrast to the real world in which “shit happens.” Like many aspects of the story, this idea is a perturbing thought. But Rush effectively elicits an emotional response from the reader, ultimately echoing the underlying message of the novel: Whether or not we realize it, we too are living in a wild world. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>By CHLOE brightens Thayer with vegan eats</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By CHLOE, the long awaited casually hip vegan restaurant, opened its doors to eager customers at 223 Thayer St.on Friday, Jan.19. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This Thayer Street location is the newest addition to the by CHLOE chain, with two locations in Boston, one in Los Angeles and six open in addition to one upcoming in New York. By CHLOE is also spreading beyond the United States, with two locations slated to open in London this year, according to the restaurant’s website. The Providence location was originally set to premiere summer of 2017, The Herald previously reported.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By CHLOE has amassed a large social media following, boasting 87 thousand followers on Instagram and over 20,000 likes and follows on Facebook. This doesn’t come as a surprise — its rustic-meets-boho-meets-dream-dorm-room aesthetic is any instagrammer’s dream. At the Providence location, a white wicker swing with tie-dye pillows hangs in front of the window facing Thayer Street, creating the perfect spot for an afternoon study break — or photo opp. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve ... worked hard to create a welcoming environment that encourages students to visit us for lunch between classes, as a meet up for a study group or a place to grab coffee with friends,” Samantha Wasser, cofounder of by CHLOE, wrote in an email to the Herald. The combination of small tiled bistro tables and larger dining tables allows for this variability. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The building by CHLOE occupies is not owned by Brown, unlike some of the retail and restaurant spaces on Thayer, said John Luipold, assistant-vice president of real estate for Brown. But Brown’s vicinity certainly served as a drawing factor for the restaurant chain. “When the corner location became available on Thayer Street, we knew we wanted it, so that meant Providence was our next city to conquer,” Wasser wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think that the offerings that are on Thayer, particularly with the addition of by CHLOE and B.Good, tap in to the Brown student community very well,” Luipold said, noting that Thayer is following the trends of the restaurant industry, as healthier options take over. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By CHLOE’s decor and selection of healthy food are very much geared toward millennials, making college students the perfect audience. Its first location on Bleecker Street in New York City catered to New York University students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“College towns are filled with a perfect cross-section of residents, students, faculty and tourism, and towns like Providence that have an amazing dining and culture scene only make it that much more appealing to us to continue growing,” Wasser wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The millenial vibe of by CHLOE is evident as soon as customers reach the cashless register — by CHLOE has transitioned to a solely card based payment system. Orders are taken quickly, and cashiers request phone numbers along with names so texts can be<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sent automatically once orders are ready. Among the menu’s favorites are the sweet potato fries, avocado pesto pasta and creative daily specials such as clementine lemonade. The food isn’t necessarily cheap. The small serving of pasta is $5.95 and the popular Guac Burger is $10.95, but customers may find it reassuring to know that the ingredients are fresh and healthy, and that each dish is made to order. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Patrons Peri Sheinin ’21 and Katie Ta ’19 enjoyed an avocado toast and a spicy Thai salad. “I found out about it from my teammate who lives in Boston,” Sheinin said, affirming that she would return because of the selection of new and different lunch options. Both Ta and Sheinin agreed that the food was expensive, but the health benefits and flavors would bring them back.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The shop appears to have garnered popularity on campus — a walk by the storefront windows reveals students at last tasting the highly anticipated cuisine. “By CHLOE is a place where students can get affordable and delicious food no matter their dietary preferences. Whether you’re plant-based, kosher, dairy-free or gluten-free —there is an option for everyone,” Wasser wrote.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Low Anthem releases new album</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/24/woodward-low-anthem-band/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Low Anthem, an eminent Providence-based indie folk act, is slated to release their fifth LP, “The Salt Doll Went to Measure the Depth of the Sea” Feb. 23. Band co-founders Jeff Prystowsky ‘06 and Ben Knox Miller ‘06 both studied music at Brown, founding The Low Anthem shortly after graduating in 2006. Instead of moving to Brooklyn — where Knox Miller said “all the cool bands wentin the Myspace days” — they decided to produce their music in Providence because “it’s cheap and there are lots of inspiring people who are trying to do something creative” and it’s “also within two hours of all these major markets where we can go and perform.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of their albums, “Smart Flesh,” released in 2011, was recorded in a deserted Porino’s pasta sauce factory in Central Falls, Rhode Island — a building with surprisingly great acoustics. “It was a cavernous space, and at the time we were interested in sound that sounded like it was coming from across a field or a mile away,” Knox Miller said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When looking for a place to record their fourth album, “eyeland,” released in 2016, The Low Anthem stumbled upon the then-shuttered Columbus Theater in Federal Hill. Before closing in 2009, the Columbus had served as a performance venue — a role dating back to the 1920s. With some fundraising generated for its reopening, the Columbus came to be converted into a recording studio, music co-operative and concert venue. When asked which contemporary indie artists they admired, Prytowsky and Knox Miller mentioned Mega Bog and Haley Heynderickx, but said that they glean most of their inspiration from the performers who come through the Columbus Theater.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Nothing beats the quality of what you can see on the stage,” Knox Miller said. “The music that I’ve been exposed to is usually coming through the Columbus Theater specifically,” a venue which has recently been host to alt-rock acts Mitski and Mount Eerie, among others. The record will be marked by an accompanying release show at the venerated theater Feb. 24 to kick off the East Coast leg of The Low Anthem’s North American tour.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The Low Anthem’s sound has evolved considerably over the years. Jeff described “eyeland” as a “fantastical, psychedelic sci-fi album” centered around the “vast[ness] of our neural networks.” Eerie, cosmically whimsical tracks like “am i the dream or am i the dreamer” and “in the air hockey fire” excavated childhood and consciousness and cheekily critiqued capitalism and bureaucracy. Their new LP, “The Salt Doll Went to Measure the Depth of the Sea,” is similarly experimental and conceptual, but centers around another subject entirely: The ancient metaphor of the Salt Doll, which the band’s founders happened upon in a biography about American composer John Cage called “Where the Heart Beats.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The story goes that the Salt Doll tries to measure the depth of the sea, but it inherently can’t measure the sea and come back to share its measurements because it will dissolve,” Prystowsky said. “It’s a nice, concise account of the comedy of trying.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ten out of the album’s eleven tracks take place under or around the sea, with clever and occasionally twee lyrics that muse on the perspectives of ocean dwellers, eulogize supercontinents and chronicle the Salt Doll’s ultimately futile search for meaning and personal reconciliation as it journeys downward through the ocean’s layers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All of the rhythms on “The Salt Doll” were created on an instrument composed of three record players, an “experimental music station” invented by Knox Miller that involves “distressing a vinyl with sandpaper to create continuous loops” — a process which gives the album a uniquely immersive aquatic feel. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Above all else, The Salt Doll is conceptual, not confessional. “We get on a kick about something and we just write about that thing,” Knox Miller said. “None of our records are autobiographical — we’re latching onto an idea and illustrating it. It’s not about us at all — it’s as if we were documentary movie makers and our newest documentary was ‘The Salt Doll.’”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>2018 Oscar nominations prove more progressive</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The 2018 Oscar nominations came out early last week, firing the starting pistol for the final stretch of what has been one of the most tumultuous, industry-shaking years in Hollywood’s history. They honor a diverse, somewhat untraditional set of films, from the politically spiked scares of Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” to the young woman’s coming-of-age tale in Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s a poetic coincidence that this year marked by new films breaking into the Academy’s ranks is also the year of Harvey Weinstein’s downfall. The films he produced, under the stamp of Miramax and the now-defunct Weinstein Company, were largely old-fashioned, serious-minded affairs; historical epics (“The English Patient”), issue dramas (“My Left Foot”) and nostalgia trips (“Chicago”) varied in quality but were united in their projection of good taste. The wrenching irony of Weinstein as an arbiter of good taste should be readily apparent.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But, come to think of it, a “projection of good taste” isn’t a bad description of the Oscars themselves. They purport to acknowledge the best of the best in any given year of movie-making, but what they really do — at least up until recently — is obligingly acknowledge a certain haughtily middlebrow, white-people-dominated type of movie. The term “Oscar bait” is less a critical judgment than it is a genre. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That the world’s most prominent film awards have such a narrow idea of the “best” does neither the art nor the industry any favors. When boring movies — like “A Beautiful Mind” — keep winning Oscars, boring movies — like “The King’s Speech” — keep getting made. But this year’s crop of nominees suggests that our conception of what movies can win Oscars is changing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Take “Get Out,” a film that could scarcely be further away from the Weinstein ideal of an Oscar movie. It is a sharp, uncompromising film about contemporary racism that’s also a horror film that’s also a comedy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of those qualities point to traditional Oscar success — in fact, they point away from it — and yet “Get Out” pulled in four nominations, including one for best picture. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The most notable of its nominations may be the one for Daniel Kaluuya, the film’s star. In “Get Out,” Kaluuya gives the kind of performance that rarely receives awards attention: He is subtle and authentically human, the clear-headed man in the middle of a vortex of off-the-wall thrills and political allegory. It’s not a performance that screams “I’m acting!” and yet it’s essential to the film’s success. Though Gary Oldman may end up taking the award for his hammy performance as Winston Churchill, the presence of Kaluuya in this category — along with fellow twenty-something Timothée Chalamet for his pitch-perfect, devastating performance in “Call Me By Your Name” — is as surprising as it is exciting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Academy’s demonstrated warmth toward “Lady Bird” is another point of pleasant surprise. In the moment of #MeToo, it’s tempting to opt for the blinkered and crudely drawn female rage of “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” and the Academy still might. But “Lady Bird,” in its sensitively crafted portrait of a mother and daughter living their lives and figuring out their relationship, is a female story scaled to human life and is all the more powerful for being so. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The film received five nominations, including one for best picture and two for its terrific central acting duo, Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf. But most exciting is Greta Gerwig’s directing nomination. Gerwig doesn’t have the awesome technical prowess of Christopher Nolan, and she doesn’t make obvious ploys for cinephilic rapture a la Guillermo del Toro. But she has a crisp visual style, a keen sense of rhythm and a deep understanding of her characters. Her direction isn’t attention-grabbing or jaw-dropping; it’s simply perfect. Kudos to the Academy for recognizing it as such.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“Lady Bird” and “Get Out” are deviations from the Oscar norm just based on the films themselves, but they’re different in a more obvious way, too: Neither is directed by a white man. In response to things like #OscarsSoWhite and Natalie Portman’s sly “all-male nominees” barb at the Golden Globes, the Oscars face mounting pressure to diversify — and they’re making strides. In June, the Academy invited a record 774 new members, many of whom were women and people of color. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The nominations for “Lady Bird” and “Get Out” make more sense, then, and point to a brighter future for the Academy. Because the two films aren’t just different in who they represent, on screen and off. They are different in their politics, their genres, their themes and even their aesthetics. Thanks to activists’ insistence on diversity in Oscar-nominated films, the Oscars have had to nominate movies that normally wouldn’t circulate in awards circles, and — quelle surprise! — they’re a whole lot better than “The Artist.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"> So Weinstein can keep the “Tulip Fever” Blu-rays for the twenty-to-life that’s coming to him. A number of talented artists — Gerwig and Peele chief among them — have arrived to make their mark, and Oscar is just starting to know it.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">For the next month, the walls of the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts will exhibit the unique skills, interests and talent of students in the Brown-RISD Dual Degree Program as their tenth annual exhibition presents work in a variety of media. Opened on Jan. 25, the exhibit colors the Cohen Gallery and overflows throughout the living rooms and corridors of Granoff.</p>
<p class="p4">The gallery immediately confronts visitors with “X: The Tenth Annual Brown-RISD Dual-Degree Exhibition” printed boldly on the wall. Scattered around this title are statements beginning with “X =.” While some comment on the fact that this reflects the dual-degree program’s tenth year in existence, others hint at themes, such as “X = the ambiguous,” “X = the unknown” or “X = anything you want, baby.”</p>
<p class="p4">Since its creation in 2008, the five-year-long dual-degree program has maintained its status as a highly selective, intensive course of study. Admitting only 15 students each year, the program aims to allow students to collaborate and work interdisciplinarily as they cultivate their academic and artistic interests, according to the program’s website. “I personally find that the work that I did at Brown informs what I do at RISD,” said Laura Jaramillo ’20, a dual-degree student studying furniture design and gender studies who showed an illustration in last year’s exhibition.</p>
<p class="p4">“It provides a separate window into the same mode of thinking,” said Jake Ruggiero ’21, a first-year in the dual-degree program, speaking to the connection between his studio classes at RISD and his literary arts classes at Brown.</p>
<p class="p4">In the Cohen Gallery, a piece entitled “Ladder to the Sky” and composed of cotton, silk, linen and denim fabric towers at the center of the gallery’s concrete floor. At certain angles, its image is reflected in the circular mirror of “Valet Chair,” a piece of furniture created to give one the “chance to sit and tie your shoes, grab your jacket and check your face before you leave the house,” as described by the artist, Jana Butman ’18, in a statement on the piece’s plaque. Upstairs, a “semi-satirical, semi-documentary short film” — as described on its plaque — by Haysung Yoon ’18 titled “To do, To Avoid” plays behind the 3D building at the stair landing. Down each corridor, pieces of multiple dimensions are displayed.</p>
<p class="p4">The tenth-annual exhibition was hosted by the Brown Arts Initiative. “Our … philosophy is that we are interested in work that is experimental, collaborative (and) engaged,” said Chira DelSesto, associate director of the BAI, adding that the dual-degree students are “poster children” for what the BAI stands for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Much of the work that they are doing is in new media, DelSesto said, adding that it is the type of “real boundary-pushing work that the BAI promotes.”</p>
<p class="p4">The event was attended by students, faculty and community members. “Annually, the opening for the Brown-RISD show, which was just last week, is always our most well-attended exhibition opening, regardless of what the work is,” DelSesto said. This speaks to the community, spanning between both universities, that is fostered by dual-degree students. “For me, (the exhibition) is … a way of catching up with my friends in the program,” Jamarillo said.</p>
<p class="p4">The exhibition will be on display in Granoff through Feb. 18.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Music Now’ Forum presents guest Kate Soper</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">Students passionate about composition listened eagerly as performer and composer Kate Soper discussed her experiences in the world of music last Wednesday. The event was part of “Music Now,” an informal lecture series established in 2015.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“We founded (Music Now) with the goal of providing a forum for students and faculty interested in contemporary music,” said </span>Assistant Professor of Music Eric Nathan, who founded the series along with Assistant Professor of Music Wang Lu and Professor of Music and Director of the Brown Arts Initiative Butch Rovan<span class="s3">.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The series hopes to give younger composers “an opportunity to see what’s going on in the field” and to build a community, Wang said. </span></p>
<p class="p4">In selecting the artists for “Music Now,” diversity is a key criterion. “We try to have diverse representatives from different cultures, ages, ethnicities and genders,” Wang explained. “Music Now” also looks for artists that run the gamut of musical voices, aesthetics and viewpoints, Nathan said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The artists featured this year comprise a “terrific line up of musicians,” he added. They include Kristina Warren, Tania León and Joan Tower, among other celebrated musicians.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kate Soper’s credentials are a testament to the high standards of “Music Now.” A Pulitzer Prize finalist, Soper “is garnering great recognition in the field for her work and is having her work presented at top institutions,” Nathan said. She “has done very interesting things using voice and theatrical context,” he said, adding that he has included her music in his teaching and that his students have loved it. “I knew (her talk) would be something our students would be really looking forward to.”</span></p>
<p class="p4">Most of Soper’s recent and current compositions are focused on music with text, Soper said. “I try to think about how meaning exists in music and how the presence of text can complicate that meaning,” she explained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What happens to a text when you set it to music?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can music tell us something real and direct?”</p>
<p class="p4">Soper also said she often employs theatrical elements in her work, which allows her to engage with the audience in a different way. It prompts them to start thinking of the musicians more as fellow humans rather than as people merely making music, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Soper’s talk gave an overview of her music and answered both practical and abstract questions about how to be a composer. “I hope to alleviate anxiety amongst young composers,” she said. “I wanted to share some of the conclusions I’ve come to.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">While a significant number of the artists featured in the “Music Now” series are involved with composition, the founders have made a point of also inviting guests who are not composers, Nathan said. This includes conductor Gil Rose and pianist Gloria Cheng as well as<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nadia Sirota, violist and producer of the Peabody Award-winning radio show “Meet the Composer.” Some of the artists are also faculty members, which allows students to see what Brown faculty are doing in their creative work, Nathan said. </span></p>
<p class="p4">The doors of “Music Now” are open to the general public, Nathan said. “We want to bring new music and new ideas about music to the Brown community — but to the larger Providence community as well,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Call Me By Your Name’ artistic, lacks depth</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Call Me By Your Name,” which was adapted from a 2007 novel, directed by Italian director Luca Guadagnino, promises to pander to audiences with its premise of a gay love story, a theme that has yet to be fully developed in American cinema. But in reality, only the mesmerizing aesthetics of the film might move theatergoers; barren character development and dialogue renders its emotional content fruitless.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The film’s protagonist is Elio — played by Timothée Chalamet — a musically prodigious and multilingual 17-year-old boy who is spending the summer holiday with his parents at their countryside villa in an idyllic northern Italian town. His life appears to be perfect, which the cinematography shows; the camera guides viewers through languid summer days under the Mediterranean sun, which he spends riding bikes through the pristine town and its pastoral environs and swimming in aquamarine pools with gorgeous Italian- and French-speaking friends. The affluent, summery look of the film largely references that of Vittorio De Sica’s 1971 classic, “The Garden of the Finzi-Continis.” This all changes, perhaps to the downfall of both Elio and the film as a whole, with the arrival of 24-year-old Oliver (Armie Hammer), the visiting American assistant to his father, a scholar of archaeology.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At first Elio resents Oliver — for occupying his room, seducing his girl friends<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and winning over his parents’ affection. But he soon becomes infatuated with the equally intelligent and attractive foreigner, frantically scribbling love notes in his journal and sneaking into Oliver’s room to masturbate to the scent of his swim trunks. He eventually gains the courage to quietly profess his attraction to Oliver in the town square. Though Oliver is initially reluctant for the sake of discretion, he reciprocates and they begin an intense sexual relationship, even though Elio conducts affairs with girl friends all the while.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sensation that Guadagnino thrusts to the forefront of the film is that of hedonism, illustrated by the episode in which a bored Elio innovatively uses a deseeded peach to pleasure himself to the point of ejaculation, the remnants of which are later discovered by a delighted Oliver. But the film does not bear such fruits, not even the normal kind. For all the richness in the soundtrack, which features Sufjan Stevens, and the visuals masterfully shot in 35mm film, there is no emotional content to the film. Elio cries when Oliver inevitably leaves at summer’s end, but it is difficult for the viewer to empathize with a character whose inner thoughts are never revealed, regarding a romance with emotional complexities that are never revealed. It’s a mystery as to why Elio loves Oliver so deeply in the first place. It is also unclear why they call each other by their own respective names, the film’s eponymous conceit. While Elio’s father expresses his acceptance of his son’s first love in a moving speech, it’s too late for the viewer to care. Maybe what the film lacks is a grounding in any real hardship, but that apparently would not exist for a gay couple of somewhat disparate ages in a small town in Italy in the ’80s.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At its best, the film is beautiful but dull. The inimitable, Instagram-reminiscent aesthetics relegate any space in the film for explaining the intricacies of Elio and Oliver’s desire for each other to close-ups of butts and six-packs. At worst, the movie risks misrepresenting many facets of gay love to American audiences, many of whom are viewing it on screen for the first time. The narrative centers around two main characters who are hyper-attractive, privileged white people. Even more problematic is how Guadagnino explicitly relates the pair’s romance to the ancient Roman practice of pederasty — the type of love between an adult man and his younger companion, which repeatedly appears in the artifacts of Elio’s father and Oliver’s archaeological work. This certainly does not help deflect the many enduring claims of gay men as predatory. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The film marks — in many critics’ summations — Guadagnino’s big break into American cinemas and audiences. By combining many tropes of his previous films — which range from beautiful European settings to polemical displays of romance — Guadagnino effectively caters to American viewers’ appetite for vapidity, betraying any essence of emotional substance to concentrate on aesthetics. It begs the question of how to portray intimacy on screen, especially between individuals of queer identities. Unlike “Moonlight,” a truly pioneering film in its delicately profound and insightful depiction of growing up queer and its romantic trials, “Call Me By Your Name” presents gay desire as an empty pursuit comprised of nothing beyond good looks and shallow intellectual fodder. Ultimately, the film and its characters look too good to be true. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AS220, Providence Community Radio and Brown Student and Community Radio acquired the local, Low Power radio station WBRU-FM 101.1 FM last month, after a process of several years. This new development in community radio comes in the wake of the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/24/fcc-approves-wbru-fm-signal-sale-christian-nonprofit/">sale of WBRU’s frequency</a> 95.5 last year for $5.63 million. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re technically three different radio stations sharing time on one signal,” said David Dvorchak, the communications director of AS220. BSR, AS220 and PCR jointly applied for a construction permit in 2013. Their joint station was approved last year to begin broadcasting in Jan. 2018, Dvorchak said. Rather than being a large, commercial radio station, Low Power is noncommercial and has a listening radius of 3.5 miles, according to the Federal Communications Commission website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The effort has been many years in the making; BSR had been involved in an appeals process with the FCC since 2000, said Willem Pickleman ’18, the studio manager of Brown Student and Community Radio. At the same time, PCR was started in the same year by friends who wanted Providence to have its own Low-Power FM radio station, said the organization’s Program Director Frank Mullin.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All three organizations hope to bring to Providence less commercialized and more locally-sourced content. BSR plans to broadcast syndicated, archival and live programming of music, talk shows and podcasts, including at least eight hours daily of radio shows from a pool of around 20 trained student DJs, Pickleman said. “Instead of focusing on one specific area of music or talk radio, we try to do stuff you wouldn’t really find on any big radio station.” With the new FM presence, BSR hopes to reach more of the community beyond just the University, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, PCR hopes to consolidate many different segmented forms of media — including podcasts and music — under a single frequency for the enjoyment of the community, Mullin said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">AS220’s programming is still largely undecided, as the organization plans to act more as a facilitator for community voices, Dvorchak said. He added that the content, however, would align with the organization’s core values of being “unjuried and uncensored.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, only BSR broadcasts content on-air. But there are plans for AS220, PCR and 360 Degree Experience in Sound — WBRU’s hip hop and R&amp;B program — to eventually have their own days, Pickleman said. The old WBRU has continued to stream its programs on its website, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last August, WBRU sold its frequency 95.x5 to the syndicated, nationwide Christian radio network K-LOVE as a part of a larger transition for the station, Pickleman said. The move was highly opposed by the University, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the same time, WBRU was helping the internet-only BSR obtain and finance its own terrestrial radio station. “The station sold the WBRU call signs to BSR for a nominal fee,” Pickleman said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“BSR actually used to operate WBRU until the station became its own entity separate from the University in 1962,” Pickleman said. “The name is almost coming back to its rightful owner.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Sandra Feinstein-Gamm Theatre’s performance of Anton Chekhov’s play “Uncle Vanya” failed to do justice to the biting satirical realism for which its author is so well-known. The play will run from Jan. 18 to Feb. 18 and is directed by accomplished Chekhov translator Curt Columbus, the award-winning mind behind the local Trinity Repertory Company.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The plot of “Uncle Vanya” follows the extended visit of an elderly professor, Serebryakov, and his young, beautiful second wife, Yelena, to a country estate that his plain, unmarried daughter, Sanya, and manic ex-brother-in-law, Vanya, have grudgingly managed for most of their adult lives. Confusing, no? Reviewing the family tree before attending is strongly advised. At the very least, the director could have provided audiences with a schematic in the play’s accompanying program. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the characters struggle to reconcile their family’s complicated past and present, unlikely alliances emerge, unrequited love runs rampant and the tedium of provincial life ultimately drives both the play’s characters and its audience members to the brink of insanity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Chekhov’s original text and Columbus’ translation are rich, the directing — although well-intentioned ­— leaves much to be desired, with poor performances by several cast members that make the play’s characteristically tangled and confusing Chekovian plotline hard to endure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Among the worst of the culprits was Rachel Dulude (Sonya) whose inflections in the show’s first act often seemed unnatural and over-rehearsed. Thankfully, Dulude seemed to warm up by the end of the second act, and her character’s loneliness and desperation finally began to glean sympathy from the audience. Easily the most deserving of criticism is Tony Estrella, who played the show’s dark, irreverent protagonist, Vanya. Estrella’s portrayal of depression was inaccessible, abrasive and disappointingly one-note — imagine near-constant chaos, clamor and nihilistic glee. Furthermore, his many tantrums were often punctuated by unnecessarily loud stomping that only served to rattle the set and distract from the action. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The set, designed by Michael McGarty, served as a charming backdrop for the family’s many dramas — so long as it wasn’t being violently stomped upon. Richly furnished wooden platforms raised at varied heights were used to signify the mansion’s many rooms, often allowing for multiple dialogues to take place simultaneously. The set’s only flaw was a large wheel used to simulate the sound of rainfall, which was comically disruptive when operated in clear view of the audience.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The play’s sequences were broken up by musical interludes wherein a cheery house-servant named Waffles led the cast in renditions of songs like Soft Cell’s “Tainted Love” and The Cure’s “Boys Don’t Cry.” These interludes were irritating because they seemed to be attempting to compensate for the aforementioned actors’ ineptitude. Instead of watching the characters’ internal conflicts play out on the stage, audience members were forced to hear those internal conflicts summarized by pop-rock anthems.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The performance partly redeemed itself in its second act, when unlikely friendships blossomed between Yelena and Sonya, two strong, shrewd women trapped by the patriarchy, and Vanya and Astrov, two hopeless has-beens disillusioned by their insignificance in the cosmic scheme of things. Special mention goes to Marianna Bassham (Yelena) and Steve Kidd (Astrov), who both created playful, robust characters that made their anxieties deeply felt and transparent to the audience.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In an interview featured in the playbill, Curt Columbus bemoans how most people experience Chekhov through the “Chekhov Industrial Complex” — what the director deems “sad, boring plays about siblings incapable of taking public transportation.” Though Columbus may have tried to imbue his production with levity and light, his actors’ lacking performances made many audience members wish they, too, could hop a train to Moscow; or anywhere but that theater. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Phantom Thread’ explores toxic love</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The toxicity of love can be strangely appealing — whether experienced directly or vicariously. Naturally, this does not hold true for all romances — indeed, it would not appear to hold true for most. Yet “Phantom Thread,” currently playing at Cable Car, explores a paragon of this mysteriously enticing je ne sais quoi born of a largely twisted relationship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film stars Daniel Day-Lewis as Reynolds Woodcock — a dominating, fastidious and obsessive dress designer in the 1950s in England, who almost defines peculiarity. Living in a realm of elegance, haute couture, models and muses, Reynolds’ life comprises a range of eccentric habits. He sews secret messages into the lining of his dresses, he only consumes asparagus when prepared with oil — asparagus cooked with butter is sacrilege — and his mornings must be marked by utter silence. Needless to say, it isn’t in the least surprising when he describes himself as a “confirmed bachelor.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When Reynolds meets Alma (Vicky Krieps) — a waitress, who soon takes on the role of his muse — his meticulously structured world is threatened. Though dominated by Reynolds at first, Alma soon emerges from a position of submission with a force that matches his control and authority. What may have initially been construed as one of Reynolds’ passing fancies transforms into an established relationship and then marriage. But their romance is paradoxical, characterized by the warmth of affection, love and desire, alongside icy inhospitality, sin and unhealthy obsession. Without giving too much away, there is a distinct element of sadomasochism in their dysfunctional interactions that cannot be missed. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The film’s plot is fairly straightforward, navigating the evolution of Alma and Reynolds’ relationship. But the questions it raises are far from simple. Anderson examines a plethora of psychosexual, moral and philosophical issues that stem from the duo’s relationship, which continue to engage the viewer long after the film ends. Yet the explorations of “Phantom Thread” go beyond the protagonists’ unconventional romance. Indeed, Anderson leverages their relationship as a tool to subtly introduce a melange of topics, ranging from the power dynamics of gender roles to the purpose of art. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The success of “Phantom Thread” largely revolves around the performances of Day-Lewis and Krieps, who embody their characters and concretize their respective idiosyncrasies flawlessly. Brilliant dialogue and sardonic wit mark their interactions, and their non-verbal communication is no less impressive. While the spotlight is focused on Reynolds and Alma, one must not dismiss the significance of a third character: Reynolds’ sister, Cyril, who runs his fashion business in addition to overseeing his routine — and essentially his life. Portrayed beautifully by Lesley Manville, Cyril has a tart expression permanently tattooed upon her visage and exudes impeccable coldness. Her comportment and eerie omnipresence — which bear an uncanny resemblance to those of Mrs. Danvers in Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca” — never fail to tacitly command authority. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The cinematography in “Phantom Thread” is stunning and exquisitely portrays the distinct world that the characters inhabit. Anderson’s camera captures an array of textures, colors and tones with detail that lends an element of almost hyperrealism to the mundane. The costume design is incredible, too — Reynolds’ garments are breathtaking and even ordinary clothing worn by the characters has been designed to fit the period impeccably. Anderson’s artistry is also complemented well by Johnny Greenwood’s musical score, which features a spectrum of genres. Dominant through the film, Greenwood’s music successfully captures a range of moods and mimics the transformation of Reynolds and Alma’s tumultuous love. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Phantom Thread” is guaranteed to rivet most spectators. Despite its dark and unconventional facets, the film is hard to criticize. In terms of aesthetics, performance and originality, it is an absolute feast.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hanging above Bolt Coffee at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum is Pedro Reyes’ flag “Hands On With A Vision,” the latest installment in “Pledges of Allegiance,” a nationwide art project put on by the New York-based public arts nonprofit Creative Time. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With each opening of the cafe’s heavy doors, the sky-blue flag ripples slightly, revealing more of the image obscured by its folds. The flag’s graphic plays on the recognizable flag of the United Nations, which depicts a similar white emblem centered on a blue background. The emblem on Reyes’ flag reinterprets the UN symbol: An open eye sits in the palm of a hand and is layered in front of a globe that is dissected by longitudinal and latitudinal lines. The flag represents “The People’s United Nations” — “pUN” — which the flag’s placard describes as “an experimental conference developed by the artist” that has brought together individuals from over 160 countries at three meetings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the placard, Reyes writes: “This right palm with an eye at the center … has been a symbol of protection across cultures and millennia,” adding that the hand, which is open in salutation, “placed over an orb is meant to signal our mission to protect the planet.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reyes’ work is the eighth installment of a collaborative compilation of 16 flags, which will be on display at museums nationwide through July 31. Other featured artists include Alex Da Corte, Tania Bruguera and Jeremy Deller. The first flag shown at the RISD Museum “Untitled (Dividing Time)” was also displayed at nine other locations across the nation from Sept. 13 through Oct. 11 last year. The number of museums, galleries and institutions hosting installments of the series has increased each month as participants are continuously added to host pieces of the rotating series. In addition to the RISD Museum, California College of the Arts, Texas State Galleries and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell will also display the flags.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On its website, Creative Time states that, in response to the current political climate, the exhibition’s goal is “to inspire a sense of community among cultural institutions, and begin articulating the urgent response our political moment demands.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We … thought that this would really be a great way for us to … have a project that kept pace with changing times,” said Dominic Molon, the Richard Brown Baker curator of contemporary art at the RISD Museum. “Pledges of Allegiance” is dynamic in nature, which Molon sees as “something that would ... demonstrate how the museum was wanting to engage with the present moment and with the future.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Molon, “Imagine Peace,” the flag by Yoko Ono, was one of the most well received at the RISD Museum. On the flag, bold type reads, “THINK PEACE ACT PEACE SPREAD PEACE IMAGINE PEACE,” against a white backdrop. In the background of a video accompanying “Imagine Peace” on Creative Time’s website, echoing voices recite statements describing their definition of peace. For one speaker, “peace is understanding someone else’s point of view,” while for another, “peace is like a puddle of puppies … or sleeping on a marshmallow.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Molon considers the museum a place where community members can find “some kind of reflection of what’s going on out there in the world.” “Pledges of Allegiance,” its changing nature and the artists’ messages demonstrate this concept. “Hands On With A Vision” will be on display at the RISD Museum until Feb. 14, while the entire exhibition, “Pledges of Allegiance,” will continue to show through July 31. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Reading honors Langston Hughes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A large crowd gathered Sunday at the Providence Public Library for the 23rd Annual Langston Hughes Community Poetry Reading. The event was held to celebrate the life and work of the prolific eponymous Harlem Renaissance poet. Over the course of several hours, performers of many age groups and ethnicities read 40 of Hughes’ poems, many of which criticized the United States’ hypocritical conception of democracy, celebrated the “vernacular of blackness” and “demanded that the humanity of black people everywhere be recognized,” said program co-coordinator April Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Art does that. It demands that humanity be recognized. Poetry invites us to exercise our own meaning-making and agency,” said guest scholar Renee T. White, whose speech prefaced the readings. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The readings were set to music by the Daniel Ian Smith Jazz Trio, a group that has accompanied the event for the past 19 years. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think we started performing at the Langston Hughes Community Poetry Reading right around the time that Brady started winning Super Bowls,” joked bandmember Keala Kaumeheiwa, who composed an original piece to accompany his reading of Hughes’ “Dream Boogie.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Our appreciation for Hughes’ work has grown much deeper since we started” performing at the event, added the Trio’s frontman, Daniel Ian Smith.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Formerly held in the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, this was the first year that the event has taken place in the Providence Public Library. “Langston would want this event to be in the Public Library,” Brown said, alluding to Hughes’ reputation as a “people’s poet.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The program was co-coordinated by Anne Edmonds Clanton, the founder of the Langston Hughes Center for the Arts and Education, and made possible by a grant from the Rhode Island Council for the Humanities, in addition to other cultural organizations from Rhode Island. The previous Friday, a similar event that catered specifically to youth was held at the Southside Cultural Center of Rhode Island. Accompanied by hip-hop music, the event featured performances from Nowell Academy students and AS220 Youth, Brown said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The reading was attended by Hughes enthusiasts from many walks of life — local professors, precocious middle schoolers and supportive family members flocked to the Providence Public Library. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Karen Maude, an educator from Boston, said that she came because she loves Hughes’ work and because she wanted to support her aunt, who was reading.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I have always enjoyed (Hughes’) poetry. I use it to inspire pieces from my students by first reading his work and talking about the political issues he talked about, and then having them write their own poetry,” Maude said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dannie Ritchie, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the University, who was invited to read “Songs to the Dark Virgin,” described the event as “an opportunity to gather, grow and celebrate each other.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Cuban dance fusion band Los Habaneros enraptured audience members in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts’ Martinos Auditorium with a performance inspired by a mixture of genres, including salsa and jazz, last Thursday. Gerardo Contino, the band’s Havana-born director and singer, dedicated Los Habaneros’ 90-minute set to his “beautiful and complicated country.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The band was fronted by Contino sporting gold-rimmed glasses and gelled hair. After just a few songs, the delighted audience members waved their arms and rose from their seats to dance. At one point, Contino invited a few lucky dancers on stage. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(Los Habaneros) were so happy and carefree,” said Veronica Rigobon ’21. “I’m Latin American, so it’s everything I love about my culture, honestly.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The concert paid homage to Havana, from which many of the band’s members hail, and New York, the band’s current base, presenting music that ranged from a vibrant rendition of the Cuban dance classic “Chan Chan” — played by the whole ensemble — to an intimate piano-driven love ballad that Contino wrote for his wife. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It doesn’t matter if you understand (Spanish); all you have to feel is the music,” Contino said. “Tonight was magic. I saw people feel that so I accomplished my mission.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Between songs, Contino kept the audience both entertained and reflective. Introducing his United States-born bassist, he said, “We don’t take jobs; we make jobs.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The concert was accompanied by a talk held earlier that day at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs during which Contino spoke to attendees about his<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>life’s trajectory. Contino grew up in a materially-deprived, blackout-ridden Cuba before becoming a law student and then moving to New York to create music with Los Habaneros, said Jessaca Leinaweaver, director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, professor of anthropology and a co-organizer of the event. Los Habaneros is the third Latin American musical group to be invited this year by the Department of Music and CLACS to stage a series of performances, workshops and public talks, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Certainly one of the most satisfying things … is seeing the huge range of people (in the audience),” Leinaweaver said, emphasizing the cultural value and sense of community these events bring to Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Los Habaneros’ most recent album, ‘Los Habaneros NYC,’ is out now. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>List features 20th century Mexican artists</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/06/list-features-20th-century-mexican-artists/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the bright, coral-colored walls of the List Art Center lobby, “Llevando la Cultura: Conflicting Narratives in Mexican Art” exhibits a collection of artworks by 20th century Mexican artists, pulled from the Bell Gallery’s permanent collection. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Curated by Rica Maestas GS, a public humanities master’s student, the exhibition focuses on three major themes that are “central in the conversations around what the 'new', post-revolutionary Mexico looks like,” Maestas said. These themes include industrialization and globalization, religion and education reform and women and culture. The “theme of the role of indigenous people in Mexico” is present throughout different portions of lobby space, Maestas added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The exhibition displays a breadth of media and styles — from Diego Rivera’s 1932 pencil sketch made in preparation for a mural to the 1939 wood engravings by<em><strong> </strong></em><span class="il">Leopoldo</span><em><strong> </strong></em>Méndez. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It additionally spotlights artists who utilized publicly accessible media to communicate “very political and ideological messages,” Maestas said. Additionally, the exhibition’s breadth in medium and in topic serve to “exhibit a diversity of perspectives,” Maestas said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Maestas’ ideas for the show first came from the director of the Bell Gallery, Jo-Ann Conklin, who hoped to feature works highlighting the Bell Gallery’s extensive collection, including a “sizable and robust collection of artworks by Mexican artists,” Maestas said. Inspiration also flowed from the results of the November 2016 presidential election. “Revolution was on my mind,” Maestas said. Through research, she found that the theme of revolution was “important to the art that was being made at that time as well,” creating “a nice resonance between the moment we find ourselves in politically” and the art on display. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bell Gallery’s recent acquisition of three photographs by Mexico City-based photographer Graciela Iturbide adds nuance to elevate the exhibition. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These photographs offer “a more contemporary lens,” Maestas said. One of the photographs, “Prótesis—El Baño de Frida (Prosthesis—Frida’s Bathroom),” was taken in 2005, when Iturbide photographed a bathroom in Frida Kahlo’s Mexico City house, which had been closed to the public by Frida Kahlo’s husband and fellow artist, Rivera, for 50 years. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Iturbide described the experience as “very intense. … There I learned that she was a marvelous woman who contended with a lot of pain.” In the photograph, a brown and red prosthetic leg stands alone in contrast to the wet, bright blue concrete that surrounds it. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The exhibition fits with a recent trend of Bell Gallery shows. Despite the current collection of works by American artist Melvin Edwards in the main gallery space, “traditionally speaking, (the Bell Gallery has) done a lot of work with artists from different parts of the world,” Maestas said. “Those cross-cultural perspectives are important to myself — and the gallery as well,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Llevando la Cultura” is set to close Feb. 11, with a reception to be held at the List Art Lobby Feb. 9.</span></p>
<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the exhibition featured wood engravings by Leopoldine Mendez. In fact, the exhibition featured wood engravings by <span class="il">Leopoldo</span> Méndez. The article has also updated to include quotes around "new" post-revolutionary Mexico. The Herald regrets the errors.  </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thelma Golden, director and chief curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem, spoke on her curatorial career in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts’ Martinos Auditorium Wednesday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The 90-minute talk took the form of a conversation with Courtney Martin, deputy director and chief curator of the Dia Art Foundation and assistant professor of history of art and architecture at the University. Open to the public, the talk gave audience members insight into Golden’s professional journey, as well as the historical events and issues that have shaped her socially conscious practice, which is especially inspired by the work of many black artists, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The two curators guided the audience through Golden’s multifarious career working at some of New York’s most prominent and innovative museums. Golden detailed her progression, which began with a high school internship at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, followed by a curatorial position at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 2005, Golden assumed her current position at the Studio Museum in Harlem. Golden and Martin discussed some of the most revolutionary and influential shows that Golden had curated, including the Biennial Exhibition in 1993 and “Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art” in 1994 — both shown at the Whitney.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A slideshow projected above the stage accompanied the conversation, which included photos of the diverse and powerful selections of artwork that Golden had curated. Recalling the most enduring work she remembered from the 1993 Biennial, Golden described a piece created by Los Angeles-based contemporary artist Daniel Joseph Martinez: Whitney admission buttons that read “I can’t imagine ever wanting to be white.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Also memorable for Golden was the exhibition catalogue she curated to accompany “Black Male,” which featured the works of prominent authors such as bell hooks and Director of the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America Tricia Rose MA’87 PhD’93. The pair’s conversation ended with a question-and-answer session with the audience, in which Golden spoke of her plans to open a new Studio Museum in Harlem in 2021.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Museums are important sites for the critical conversations we need to have in our culture and I welcome that opportunity,” Golden said. “When everyone talks about the moment we’re in, I value that artists are looking and listening. … I know the results of (their craft) will be … incredibly powerful.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(Golden is) very put together, you could tell by the way she answered questions that she knows what she does,” said Margaret Hu ’18, a former Herald opinions editor. “She’s a superstar in the art world.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The talk will be followed by a workshop conducted by Golden Thursday, in which she will host more conversations with students in the arts and humanities about her career. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Brown Arts Initiative presented the talk as the third installment of its Warren and Allison Kanders Lecture Series, which aims to bring art world visionaries and progressive contemporary artists to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>campus, said Anne Bergeron, managing director of the BAI. “Thelma was one of the first (curators) to think about (the relationship between the art and the viewer) in a very masterful way and, in so doing, created community.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The last installment of the lecture series, a talk with artist Wangechi Mutu, will happen March 14.</span></p>

<em><strong>Corrections: An earlier version of this article stated that Courtney Martin is a former assistant professor of art history.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Members of the Providence community flocked to the Nightingale-Brown House Tuesday for a discussion about the work and complex legacy of American composer George Gershwin. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Reimagining Gershwin” was a part of the FirstWorks Artistic Icons Series, which explores artists whose works have greatly influenced the arts or have transformed their respective genres, said Kathleen Pletcher, executive artistic director of FirstWorks. “In this case, Gershwin has an incredible music legacy,” Pletcher elaborated. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lecture aimed to examine Gershwin’s continued relevance and discuss some of the ways in which the composer’s music evokes a “number of issues to be explored about race and the African American (influences that are) incorporated” in Gershwin’s compositions, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Taking the form of a panel discussion, the talk featured jazz critic Larry Blumenfeld; musician, composer and producer Melvin Gibbs; and saxophonist, composer and arranger Russ Gershon, as stated on FirstWorks’ website. “It’s an interesting, unusual stretch of speakers, and I’m excited to see the conversation between these three,” said Professor of Political Science Richard Snyder. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Much of the discussion focused on the theme of racial identity and cultural appropriation in the context of Gershwin’s musical achievements. “When you get to Gershwin, you know he’s famous, but you don’t know where the elements (in his music) came from,” Gibbs said to the audience. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A significant point of discussion was Gershwin’s controversial opera, “Porgy and Bess,” which is said to have been influenced by the Gullah culture. Gibbs, who is of Gullah descent himself, described how thinking about “Porgy and Bess” in the context of the Gullah culture changed his perspective of the piece and of Gershwin. “That’s what problematizes Gershwin for me,” he said. “As a craftsman, I have the highest appreciation for (him),” but the composer’s commonly accepted legacy obscures the accomplishments of his grassroots influences, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Often, the speakers referred to their own experiences in the world of music. As a white jazz musician, “the idea of participating in this clearly African American form (of music) has been part of my DNA as a musician. I’m always very conscious of that,” Gershon said. “Willing ignorance or erasure of a source is sometimes a very dangerous thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lecture, entitled “Reimagining Gershwin: Rhapsody in Black and Blue,” was organized in partnership with the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage, the non-profit arts organization FirstWorks and Snyder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Accompanying the lecture is a performance of “American Rhapsody: The Gershwin Songbook,” which will showcase a 17-piece big band — the only band to be assembled by the Gershwin family themselves, Pletcher said. The performance will take place Feb. 22 at The Vets.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Multidisciplinary artist Evans Molina Fernandez has amassed a large following in the Providence art scene with his dynamic aesthetic. Drawn from his Afro-Cuban identity and his passion for music, his multiculturally-influenced art has impressed gallerists and curators with both its formal aspects and its ability to provoke a range of emotions in viewers.

<b>Aesthetic mission</b>

Fernandez wants his viewers to feel free, “to feel whatever (they) want to feel,” he said. “I don’t pretend (to impose my views) like ‘that’s what I’m thinking.’ It’s not my kind of art.”

When Fernandez paints, it is never just to arrive at the finished product. “It’s a ritualistic performance,” he said. He also uses other creative media, including poetry, the music of the conga and the West African shekere, he added.

While describing a recently completed painting, “Dancer Indigena of the Holidays,” Fernandez addressed how during holidays, “people are celebrating a moment (during which) other people are suffering.” The painting appears to depict a dancing figure surrounded by circular “vibrations,” Fernandez said. “In indigenous cultures, we dance to manifest pain,” he added.

He intentionally avoids describing his art as political. “I was never a political artist, I am more about cultural (subjects),” he said, eschewing themes of political oppression for more “universal” matters.

<b>Creative upbringing </b>

Fernandez grew up in a bustling creative environment in ’80s Havana. His mother was a dancer and his father worked in the music recording industry, which exposed him at an early age to Cuban musical greats such as the folk singer Silvio Rodríguez, he said. “Music is very important for me in my life (as) an artist.”

As an adult, he began to forge his path as a creative through multiple forms of expression, including designing sets for teleplays, restoring historical sites around Cuba, studying cinematography and scriptwriting as well as directing a performance art group, he said. In 2003, he produced “Tiempo,”  an experimental short film shown at festivals in Cuba and Spain that depicted a surrealist, reality-bending experience.

<b>Move to Rhode Island</b>

Fernandez moved to Block Island, Rhode Island in 2006 after befriending Rhode Island School of Design graduates who had visited Cuba, including Providence artists Andrew Moon Bain and Brian Chippendale, said Scott Moran, artist and curator-at-large of OneWay Gallery.

While Fernandez has been a resident of Providence for around 10 years, he also has lived in Miami and Spain for periods, Fernandez said. “The art for me is like a (blessing) as an immigrant, a Latin person, an Afro-Cuban person, a black person,” he added, alluding to the fact that art allows him to meet a lot of people of different cultures. “We are making a family.”

<b>Community reception</b>

Currently, Fernandez’s paintings are being shown in multiple galleries throughout Rhode Island, including OneWay Gallery in Narragansett and Federal Hill’s Gallery Z and Skye Gallery, Fernandez said.

Steven Pennell, the coordinator of arts and culture at the University of Rhode Island Feinstein Providence campus, has included Fernandez’s work in three exhibitions over the past year for its disparate references to early 20th century Spanish artists as well as African and aboriginal art, he said.

“He’s able to blend a lot of influences from colonial to indigenous, spiritual, santeria,” said Jonny Skye, owner of Skye Gallery.

“Because it has this little bit of abstraction and folk art involved, different people see it differently and respond differently to it,” Pennel added. “When you have an exhibit with Evans … it’s just a vibrant experience.”

“What he talks about is really compelling and relevant and modern,” Skye said.

“He’s also incredibly prolific … a living, breathing artist in a way that most of us will never know,” she added. “As a gallery owner, that’s the kind of person you want work with."

Fernandez is slated to have a solo show at OneWay Gallery in Narragansett March through April.

<em><strong>Corrections: An earlier version of this article stated that Scott Moran said that while Evans Molina Fernandez has been a resident of Providence for around 10 years, he also has lived in Miami and Spain for periods. In fact, Fernandez said that while he has been a resident of Providence for around 10 years, he also has lived in Miami and Spain for periods. An earlier version of this article also stated that Steven Pennell said “He’s able to blend a lot of influences from colonial to indigenous, spiritual, santeria.” In fact, Jonny Skye said “He’s able to blend a lot of influences from colonial to indigenous, spiritual, santeria.” In addition, an earlier version of this article used the pronoun "he" to refer to Skye. In fact, Skye uses she/her/hers pronouns. The Herald regrets the errors. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“The 15:17 To Paris,” Clint Eastwood’s new film about the true story of three Americans who stopped a terrorist attack on a train in the summer of 2015, rests on a central conceit. Instead of turning to professional actors, Eastwood cast the real men to play themselves. It’s audacious, and it could have worked, too, because you never know what you’re going to get with Eastwood. His movies are hard to judge and harder to read. “American Sniper,” for example, works as either a propagandist salute to a mass murderer or a complex character study of a man challenged by war depending on who you talk to, or maybe just on which way the wind’s blowing.

Eastwood himself is no less inscrutable. He’s the man who yelled at a chair at the 2012 Republican National Convention, but he’s also the man who directed great movies before and after that strange night, from 1992’s “Unforgiven” to 2016’s “Sully.” Alas, his latest effort feels more like the work of an old man who scolds furniture than the one responsible for a handful of American classics.

It begins with a man walking through a train station, rolling a suitcase behind him and eventually boarding a train. He gives the camera a blank-faced stare before the doors close and the title card appears. If you know the premise, you can probably guess: We’ve met the terrorist.

Don’t let this trick you into thinking “The 15:17 To Paris” is an action movie. After the credits, the film flashes back to the middle school days of our three heroes. Alek Skarlatos and Spencer Stone — played, as children, by Bryce Gheisar and William Jennings — are best friends but social outcasts. Spencer complains that no one gets him and that he doesn’t fit in. Alek replies, in a conspicuously pleading and raw tenor for a between-classes conversation, “I get you! You fit in with me!”

Eastwood is a famously hands-off director, and the approach does him no favors here. The young actors, including Paul-Mikél Williams as our third protagonist, Anthony Sadler, are shockingly bad, giving performances straight out of an eighth-grade play where the chief imperative is “Don’t mumble!” Nevertheless, the three form a friendship that will last into their adult lives. An early botched attempt at emotional connection comes after an airsoft battle, scored to plaintive guitar music, when the three lie on the forest floor and wax poetic about the “brotherhood” of war.

Flash-forward to high school, when the three men are now played by themselves. Eastwood nailed the casting continuity: The grown men are just as bad at acting as their younger counterparts. To be fair, all the actors — “actors” — are saddled by Dorothy Blyskal’s tin-eared, meandering script.

Living nondescript middle-class lives, Alek and Spencer want to do something different and bigger than themselves, so they decide to join the military — Alek the National Guard and Spencer the Air Force. Alek is stationed in Afghanistan and Spencer in the Azores Islands near Portugal, while Anthony stays stateside to attend college. Still fast friends, the three decide to meet up in Europe for a cross-continental tour. Spencer and Anthony get together first, touring Italy while Alek meets a girlfriend in Germany.

For a while, the movie becomes the most benign, soporific travel documentary you’ve ever seen. Spencer and Anthony walk around, take selfies, and get gelato — Spencer goes for hazelnut, in case you want to know the flavor of champions. They marvel at the Colosseum — “It’s so big!” one of them observes — and tour Venice with a girl they meet on a boat who apparently had no plans of her own. Eventually, Anthony and Spencer meet up with Alek in Amsterdam, where the three of them grind with strangers in a nightclub and wake up with impressively unconvincing hangovers.

It’s hard to overstate just how inane the whole travel sequence is. Other than a moment when Spencer speaks of his feeling that life is “catapulting him” towards some greater purpose, none of it has any bearing on, well, anything.

Finally, we get to the train attack, but the hour and change that precedes it is so resolutely uninvolving that the big moment feels like an anticlimax. And while that does make it ideal counterprogramming to the weekend’s other big release, “Fifty Shades Freed,” it’s a crushing blow to “The 15:17 To Paris.”

It’s a real shame, because as a thought experiment, Eastwood’s idea is intriguing. Stopping a bad guy on a train is a classic action movie idea — “The Commuter” just used a version of it a month ago — so casting the real people who really did stop a bad guy on a train presents a unique opportunity to consider cinema, heroism and the intersection of the two.

But “The 15:17 To Paris” doesn’t have a self-reflexive bone in its woefully inert body. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with straightforward drama. But here’s a free tip: Hire actors next time. They’re pretty good at that stuff.]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Production Workshop’s imagining of “Julius Caesar” exudes power — evident from the play’s very description:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“This is (not) Rome — Haec Roma nostrarum est:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">This is a space (un)recognizable. Here we are womxn, femmes and more. Here, we are of many races. Here we use words like ‘lovers,’ ‘sisters’ and ‘countrywomxn’. Here is space enough to hold all our love and all our violence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">This is (not) Rome — Here is our Rome.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Directed by Caroline Sprague ’20, “Julius Caesar: Femmes, Romans, Countrywomxn” is a production of “Julius Caesar” set in an “intersectional, all-femme” world, according to PW’s website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While the work follows the original plot line of Julius Caesar’s assassination, characterizing it as just another conventional production would be far from accurate. Indeed, its distinct femme-centric approach is in stark contrast to the original texts of most Shakespearian works, in which male characters are primarily designated lead roles — a gender imbalance that is especially evident in “Julius Caesar.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The word “womxn” — instead of “women” — was intentionally used to undermine the male-centric mindset that underpins the world, said stage manager Bella Cavicchi ’21.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">This interpretation of Julius Caesar was conceptualized by Sprague, whose guiding principle was “why not,” said Beth Pollard ’21, assistant director.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Why not have a full womxn- and femme-identifying production of ‘Julius Caesar’?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s no reason why there shouldn’t be,” Pollard said. While the absence of men may seem incongruous in Caesar’s Rome, Cavicchi describes the setting “as a Rome where your expectations are going to be switched, but for the better.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite its novel conceptualization, the production tries to preserve as much of the integrity of the original plot and character development as possible, Pollard said. The names of all the characters, for instance, remained unchanged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Those are men in history and we didn’t want to change those names because they have such significance,” Pollard said. Yet, all masculine gender pronouns have been reversed to fit the femme-centered production. For instance, he becomes she, countrymen becomes countrywomxn and lords becomes ladies, Pollard explained. Stereotypically masculine motifs, such as swords, daggers and other phallic symbols have been omitted from the production too. Instead, the weapons used by the characters in this production take the form of cloth, bandages and fabric — items traditionally associated with womxn, Pollard said. Violence is a salient theme in the bloody assassination of Julius Caesar, yet “violence is also typically seen as (a) man’s domain,” Pollard said. “We wanted to understand how womxn act in conflict — what tools do womxn use that are different from men?”</span></p>
<p class="p4">Erin Malimban ’19, who plays Brutus in the production, further describes how the violence in the show is incredibly stylized. The characters often use bandages that are typically used for boxing but are painted red, she said. One character holds a bandage and puts it on another’s clothes. Then, the character pulls the bandage out, “so there’s a string connecting (the two characters) and it looks like blood.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The production’s impressive onstage conceptualization is complemented by the actresses’ offstage identities. “There are so many identities in the room,” Malimban said. Some of the people in the cast identify as non-binary, others identify as queer and others as people of color. “We (don’t) want to erase anyone’s identities, so (we) just bring them to the character instead of pretending they’re not there,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For instance, Malimban described how she brought her Filipino-American identity to her portrayal of Brutus: “There are some times when I make noises that are from my Filipino household, just to tell someone to be quiet — it’s just like a non-verbal sound or like a motion.” This process of embracing one’s offstage identity onstage makes each character specific to its actor, Malimban said. “You bring small things that you’re used to in your culture and in your life to the performance without it being a huge deal.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Both onstage and offstage, the production explores the idea of womxn-identifying people finding “catharsis” in life, according to Malimban. “The entire process has been this constant questioning of how we are people outside of being non-male and how we relate to each other singularly,” Malimban explained.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“And when audience members walk away, we want them to feel the catharsis with us,” Cavicchi said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">What’s really special about this production is that it doesn’t have a moral for the audience, Malimban said. “It’s not like we’re trying to teach you something. It’s more like we really care about this and we care about each other and we invite you to care and think with us.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">PW’s “Julius Caesar” ran last Friday through Monday at the Downspace.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Food app Snackpass expands to Providence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The food pickup app “Snackpass” arrived in Providence Jan. 24 with the goal to help locals order food electronically from Thayer Street restaurants such as East Side Pockets, Vivi Bubble Tea and Pokeworks.</p>
<p class="p4">The app “lets you save time because you can order ahead and skip the line. You can save money because there are tons of student discounts,” said Jamie Marshall, a Yale student and one of the app’s founders.</p>
<p class="p4">The app has a social component that facilitates interactions between friends. “Every time after you order, you get a bonus stamp that you can send to a friend. If it was your birthday, I could send you your favorite smoothie,” Marshall said.</p>
<p class="p4">Snackpass was launched in spring 2017<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by Marshall, Kevin Tan, who attended Yale, and Jonathan Cameron, who attended Ohio State. According to Tan, who came up with the idea for the app and codes its back end, Snackpass was the lovechild of “procrastination during finals” and “trying to impress a girl who really liked Tropical Smoothie Cafe.”</p>
<p class="p4">“I was trying to think of ways I could send her gifts from Tropical Smoothie Cafe, … so that turned into the gifting part [of the app,] where you can send people gifts from their favorite restaurants.”</p>
<p class="p4">The app was launched with little to no external funding, and its marketing was remarkably “grassroots … just flyers and talking to people,” Tan said. “We didn’t have any funding or anything, but I think that forced us to get creative and figure out what people actually wanted,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Between student discounts and social engagement, it seems like Snackpass has succeeded in figuring out what students want. Less than a year after its launch, the app has made over 600,000 sales and 80 percent of Yale undergraduates are active users, according to Tan. Marshall, a neuroscience major who grew up in Providence, explained that they’ve decided to expand to Brown because “it’s a great place, [has] a very walkable campus and is a similar size to Yale.”</p>
<p class="p4">“We launched about a week and a half ago, but we have about 800 users from Brown ­— but also RISD, Providence College and even some of the local high schools,” Tan said. “Brown has great vibes,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Snackpass aims to help local restaurants reach the student market and receive business on slow days. Marshall explained that food-delivery companies like UberEats can take up to 30 percent commission on each transaction, meaning that restaurants lose money by working with them.</p>
<p class="p4">Snackpass “is so small compared to that (so) it’s a welcome commission,” Marshall said. “It’s a pick-up app, not a delivery app, so that helps us stand out.”</p>
<p class="p4">Since partnering with Snackpass, “we’ve definitely seen some new faces,” said Kai Li, the part-time manager of Vivi Bubble Tea. “People from downtown are realizing there’s another bubble tea place (on Thayer).”</p>
<p class="p4">While Li was enthusiastic about Snackpass, he suggested that digital orders can be stressful for him and his coworkers when the store is busy, “We can’t just ignore the people in the line, so sometimes (app users) have to wait longer,” Li added.</p>
<p class="p4">Reflecting on his experience as a young entrepreneur, Tan said: “you don’t need the funding especially these days where software is essentially free. The most important thing is to build a product and get users first, and then try and get the funding if you need it, but not the other way around.”</p>
<p class="p4">Tan and Marshall mentioned that their “next move” is to bring Snackpass to students in Boston and, eventually, “the whole world.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>“I, Tonya” skates over quality despite buzz</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Plenty of ink had been spilled about “I, Tonya” before it arrived at Thayer Street’s Avon Cinema, where it is currently enjoying a run. Unsurprisingly, my critic’s log line ­­— that “I, Tonya” is a messy biopic buoyed by stellar performances from its leads — reads like a template into which you could plug and place nearly half of the modern cinematic canon. Nonetheless, the template fits “I, Tonya” like a glove. Margot Robbie and Allison Janney have received critical acclaim from both highbrow media corners and the awards circuit for their portrayals of disgraced Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding and her mother LaVona Harding, respectively. Strip away those performances though, and you are left with a film that fails to properly tap into the storytelling goldmine of one of the most seminal moments of 90s popular culture.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For those who are unfamiliar, “I, Tonya” draws its source from the infamous 1994 attack on the beloved American figure skater (and rival to Tonya Harding) Nancy Kerrigan. Harding’s ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, played by Sebastian Stan, eventually confessed to planning the assault and implicating Harding in the plot. The film relies on interviews from many of the drama’s primary instigators, remagining the incident from Harding’s perspective. Director Craig Gillespie and screenwriter Steven Rogers allow Harding’s life to unfold through a series of talking-head testimonials, which weave together a complicated and ultimately inconsistent portrait of the controversial figure skater and her alleged role in the kneecapping of her competitor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In forcing audiences to reconsider one of pop culture’s great villains, Gillespie and Rogers move the film into a well-worn cinematic sweet spot — one ripe for a thoughtful character study. Moreover, the existence of a real Tonya and LaVona covers most of the creative heavy lifting, as they provide vivid and wildly singular vessels through which Robbie and Janney can map their presences on screen. Yet “I, Tonya” ultimately disappoints in its narration of Harding’s life, as its attempt to problematize the villainous portrayal of the eponymous athlete leads to an empathy for its protagonist that ultimately feels misplaced, if not necessarily unearned. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I, Tonya” sites the locus of that empathy in the abusive and antagonistic relationship between Tonya and LaVona. Janney’s portrayal of LaVona is a model of callous malevolence, firing off explicit invectives and often inciting physical harm upon her daughter during her formative years. The film establishes Harding as a perpetual victim of abuse, as her mercurial relationship with Gillooly oftens leaves her bloodied and bruised. This angle of Harding’s life was largely absent from her criminalization in the media, even though it provides deeply rooted cycles of violence that are worth exploring carefully and thoughtfully. Gillespie and Rogers’ darkly comedic approach, however, obscures this pattern of domestic abuse. At times, these many scenes of domestic violence feel like a cheap storytelling trick ­— a surface tactic employed to suggest that Harding was not guilty of her purported role in the Kerrigan attack, but a superficial one lacking depth.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In its intent to rewrite Harding’s story, “I, Tonya” too often hesitates to question its protagonist’s viewpoint. Though it employs an overlapping perspectival storytelling style, the film often unfairly handles the narratives of every character other than Harding. Though the talking-head perspective is a neat technique that proves sometimes successful and often times quite funny, all “I, Tonya” can muster in its inquisition of Harding is to have Robbie repeat some variation of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“it wasn’t my fault.” While these moments feel like a half-hearted attempt to establish Harding as the classically misunderstood antagonist, the film more often leans into the idea that Harding was the real victim of the 1994 attack.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I, Tonya” still offers plenty to enjoy. The script’s dark and biting humor gives the film a jaunty beat, and Gillespie’s alternating takes on Scorcese and Soderbergh make for entertaining cinema. Moreover, Robbie’s visceral and humanizing turn as Harding provides one of the year’s best performances. Ultimately, though, I left the theater disappointed that a film that had received legitimate Oscar buzz could suffer so many missteps.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On Feb. 16, the indie-rock band Car Seat Headrest released a re-recording of their sixth LP, “Twin Fantasy.” The band originally unleashed the introspective concept album on the world in 2011, when the outfitwas still just the solo-recording project of suburban sad boy Will Toledo.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It’s hard to discuss the album without first paying homage to Toledo, Headrest’s progenitor and lead vocalist, who named the personal-project-turned-band “Car Seat Headrest” because he recorded the vocals of his first album in the back seat of his car. In 2010, he began self-producing lo-fi concept albums that — often quite explicitly — examined teenage identity, including 2013’s “Nervous Young Man” and 2014’s “How to Leave Town,” before signing with Matador Records in 2015. He was only 19 when he first released “Twin Fantasy” on Bandcamp, and his decision to revisit (and reinvigorate) the album after seven years feels deeply personal. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The original “Twin Fantasy,” like most of Toledo’s early music, was lyrically brilliant but poorly produced — perhaps better described as “lo-fi bedroom indie,” in the words of one Bandcamp fan. Though this DIY aesthetic was a big part of what earned some of the early Headrest albums’ cult followings, it’s now 2018, and Toledo is a successful musician with ample resources to make his original vision a reality. Press releases have stressed that this re-recording “is no shallow second take, sanitized in studio and scrubbed of feeling,” according to a statement written to accompany the album’s <a href="https://store.matadorrecords.com/twin-fantasy">release</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rather, “this is the album (Toledo) always wanted to make.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the re-recording, Toledo’s lyrics are still sprawling, confused and desperate with longing, but they’re more resolute and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>pack a bigger punch. It’s still “sad boy” music, sure — a messy memoir littered with allusions to drug use, sexual frustration and shopping malls. But Toledo’s simple poetics and stream-of-consciousness narratives seem to have higher stakes than the average, Dashboard Confessional-esque “sad boy” ballad: They are electrified with urgency and moments of triumph. Many of the tracks in “Twin Fantasy,” like “Beach Life-In-Death,” and “Bodys,” could and should be used to score car-chase scenes in action movies. Others tracks, like “Stop Smoking (We Love You)” are simple and sweet, driven by lyrical repetition and call-and-response. In “Cute Thing” — one of the album’s heavier re-writes — Toledo sings, “Give me Frank Ocean’s voice / And James Brown’s stage presence,” so earnestly that you find yourself wanting to hug him, badly. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The album’s rhythmic variety can be attributed to its “episodic” nature. “Twin Fantasy” is clearly telling a single story and the “you” that Toledo is addressing is clearly a single person — but like a movie, the narrative is delivered piecemeal. “Beach Life-In-Death,” one of the most talked-about songs on the album, is just over thirteen minutes long — a minute longer and a hell of a lot brassier than it was on the original recording. Throughout the tumult of the song, a conflicted Toledo meditates on his love for a friend (“I spent a week in Ocean City / And came back to find that you were gone”), his queer identity (“I don’t know if we’re boyfriends yet”) and the scriptedness of daily life (“What should I do? Eat breakfast / What should I do? Eat lunch”).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In this song and in others, Toledo laments, celebrates, eulogizes, misspeaks and self-corrects — constantly wrestling with the person he feels like he should be, or is, or was. His frequent mention of media platforms like Skype and YouTube might beget ridicule from some, who might regard them as sort of pandering, but these platforms were clearly influential in shaping how he currently thinks about desire — and how the rest of our generation thinks about desire, for that matter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> The album admittedly has a few cringey moments — like in “Bodys” when Toledo asks, “Is it the chorus yet? / No, it’s just the building of the verse / So when the chorus does come it’ll be more rewarding.” While self-awareness is a big part of Toledo’s voice, this meta aside just feels excessive.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Trendy asides aside, there’s something noble about the act of confronting a product of one’s confused and tactless youth and vowing to do it justice. Moreover, some great tension within Toledo seems to have been reconciled in the re-recording. The biggest difference between the two albums, according to the album’s release statement, is that Toledo “no longer sees his own story as a tragedy,” and that change is clearly reflected in the music. With a few more miles on his proverbial speedometer, a seasoned Toledo can channel his teenage malaise with greater acuity. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Art exhibition explores themes of Asian migration, movement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Last Thursday night saw the usually silent Leung Family Gallery transform into a buzzing art exhibition entitled “The Asian Migration: Movement Within and Outside.” Organized by the Asian American Student Initiative, the event explored the theme of migration and movement of Asian and Asian American communities through various forms of art, including photography, paintings and calligraphy. The exhibition also featured three performance groups: a drumming group, a singer and a dancing group. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Each year, the coordinators of AASI organize a community-focused event, said Sabrina Whitfill ’19, co-coordinator of AASI. This year’s event, which took the form of an art exhibition, “celebrated the arts and creativity within the (Asian/Asian American and Pacific Islander) community,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“One of the benefits of having an art exhibition is that it’s an open space,” Whitfill explained. In just a single room, viewers can interact with one another and simultaneously engage with the work of AAPI students from Brown and the Rhode Island School Design, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The Asian Migration: Movement Within and Outside” aimed to provide a space for different artists — especially Asian and Asian American artists — to express their voices and feelings through art, said Sumaiya Sayeed ’20, co-coordinator of AASI. Most of the artwork featured revolved around the theme of the exhibition — migration and movement — which was chosen by the coordinators. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The key event that triggered my passion about this topic was the refugee crisis in past years — specifically, the Rohingya refugee crisis, which affects a place close to home,” said Sayeed, whose parents hail from Bangladesh. “Not only are refugees a global problem, but the fact that it was so close to me really mattered to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yet, the subject of the exhibition itself is broader than the refugee crisis. Migration and movement “is intrinsic to (Asian American) identities,” Whitfill said. And indeed, a lot of the artwork featured is heavily inspired by specific experiences and the identity of the respective artist. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For instance, a psychedelic painting entitled “Hold my Foot” decked one of the walls of the gallery. Created by RISD student Christine Cho, the painting depicts a scene inside a car, featuring her immediate family. “I was thinking less about a large migration to the United States and (more about) actually navigating the space of America,” Cho said, explaining the connection of her work to the overarching theme of the exhibition. The title of the painting is inspired by memories of Cho’s parents holding her and her brother’s feet while they were in the backseats of the car, as their own arms were too short to reach their parents, she explained. “It’s a memory of intimacy I have with (my family),” Cho added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“A lot (of) Asian American memories of migration are about trauma and harder life events — but there’s also memories of intimacy and love in those moments,” Cho said. “I (chose to explore) the latter.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five must-watch 2017 films ignored by Academy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Oscars are coming up this weekend and, as tradition dictates, many of the year’s best films will not be represented. But just because the Oscars are missing out does not mean you have to. So, in the interest of expanding our collective cinematic palate and resisting the cultural hegemony of that looming golden statue, here are five seldom seen films from the past year that deserve more attention:

<b>“A Ghost Story”</b>

The beginning scenes of David Lowery’s astounding, emotionally wrenching meditation on grief and time operate as kind of litmus test: We watch a woman sit on her kitchen floor and eat nearly an entire pie over the course of a few minutes. If the moment makes you fall asleep, maybe this one’s not for you. But if you find that you can’t look away, then “A Ghost Story” may affect you as few other films do. It rests on a simple concept: After a man dies, he returns, draped in a white sheet, to the house where he lived before his death. At first, it’s just him and his wife, silently mourning from opposite sides of the grave. But as the film moves on, it becomes more cosmic in scope and goes in directions you’d least expect. Shot under wraps and on a shoestring budget, “A Ghost Story” is a minor miracle of a movie.

<b>“Lady Macbeth” </b>

If you’re on the lookout for a complex, powerful depiction of female rage, skip “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” and watch this. Based on a novella by Nikolai Leskov and adapted by British playwright Alice Birch, “Lady Macbeth” concerns a young woman living in rural 19th century England, married to a brute of a man and stuck in an isolated country mansion. When her husband leaves the estate for a business trip, she starts to push back against constricting patriarchal values and act on her own desires. But what begins as a story of Victorian repression and liberation quickly morphs into something more interesting, as our leading lady reveals a chilling psychopathy buried beneath the folds of her elegant gowns. With a discomfiting, focused performance by Florence Pugh in the lead role, “Lady Macbeth” is a fascinating work of supremely knotty feminism whose transfixing power only increases the more shocking and despairing it becomes.

<b>“The Lost City of Z”</b>

Of all the undersung films of 2017, James Gray’s extraordinary explorer’s tale may be the finest. A chronicle of the career of the early 20th century British explorer Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunham), who spent decades searching for an ancient city in the jungles of Brazil, the film strikes a delicate balance, portraying Fawcett as a man ahead of his time who still could not completely break out of the colonialist mold. Throughout, Gray displays breathtaking classical film craft, making not just pretty pictures but images that are as full of intention as they are lovely. Also featuring terrific performances from Robert Pattinson and Siena Miller and a sensational score from Christopher Spelman, the film is a near-masterpiece about reaching for the sublime — and “The Lost City of Z” finds it.

<b>“Princess Cyd” </b>

2017 was a great year for queer cinema, from the high-profile “Call Me By Your Name” to lesser-known but still worthy titles like “BPM.” Among all these, don’t miss out on “Princess Cyd,” Stephen Cone’s gentle, funny film about growing up and coming out. It takes place over the course of a few weeks in the summer, when Cyd, a high school student who is played with enormous warmth by Jessie Pinnick, goes to Chicago to stay with her aunt, novelist Miranda Ruth. Cone depicts the relationship between the two women with an intimate sensitivity, acutely mapping their awkward differences, accidental insults and cautious affection. Eventually, Cyd meets Katie, who provokes feelings and desires Cyd didn’t know she had. When she talks to Miranda about it, audiences are gifted with a moving, refreshingly low-key coming-out scene. Pair it with the father’s monologue in “Call Me By Your Name” for a soothing brew of queer parenting fantasy.

<b>“The Work” </b>

The only film of 2017 to match “Dunkirk” in terms of sheer intensity might be “The Work,” a documentary from directors Jairus McLeary and Gethin Aldous. Set in Folsom State Prison, the film depicts a yearly project that brings together convicts and men on the outside for four days of group therapy. Together, they dig into their deepest emotional struggles and force themselves to each feel their own pain in its ravaging totality. “The Work” will almost certainly make you cry, because in the face of such raw humanity, there’s nothing else you can do. But the film is also a primal scream of a wake-up call to a contemporary America torn by seemingly insurmountable differences and entrenched hatred. It shows us an impassioned embrace between a former member of the Aryan Brotherhood and a black man, suggesting what is possible without resorting to a facile vision of reconciliation. They’ve put in the work. Will we?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“Anybody in There,” a short film produced by Brown students about substance abuse, was shown at the Quincy, Massachusetts independent film festival “Stories by the River” Jan. 26.  The Brown Motion Pictures-produced project initially premiered on campus last September.

Co-director Alexandre Davis ’20 became inspired to create the film about an addict’s road to recovery through his personal experience as well as those of his friends and their families, he said. The film addresses substance abuse — encompassing opiate abuse and binge drinking — and Davis’ concern with how many people refuse to acknowledge the severity of the issue, especially in university settings, he said. “No one says that any kid in college or high school has a drinking problem; they just say they party too much,” Davis said. “But this is a real issue. I know kids that do suffer from this that go to Brown.”

After an actor suggested that the production crew apply to “Stories by the River,” a film festival centered around topics of social awareness and change, “Anybody in There” was selected for showing last month. The film was one of 10 to be selected from a pool of 80 entries, said Kristina Kaiser, co-founder and judge.

“(The film) opens up the opportunity for conversation about what to do with young people that are exploring drugs and alcohol,” she added. We like to “have a film that allows us to help people get through various difficult things in their lives.”

“Anybody in There” is based on a short story Davis wrote in his senior year of high school, which he developed into a full script for his screenwriting class final last year, he said. He then approached his friends, co-directors David Holmes ’20 and Robert Capron ’20, to transform the script into a film. Davis gathered the film’s crew from “Facunda,” a Brown Motion Pictures film he previously worked on, held auditions to cast actors and obtained funding through a Kickstarter campaign. They shot the movie in February 2017 and finished editing the film last summer.

“Anybody in There” was released in September with a premiere in Smith-Buonanno Hall, which attracted 100 people, including President Christina Paxson P’19, Davis said. It was followed by a panel in which the three directors, Assistant Dean of Chemical Dependency Shannon O’Neill and Scott Bienenfeld, an addiction psychiatrist, discussed the effects of binge drinking on college campuses and the reality of the film, he added.

“It’s an in-depth look (into substance abuse) for people not familiar with how this disease affects young people, … and for those who are familiar with it, to feel support for what they’ve gone through,” Davis said.

“I had people come up to me and tell me, ‘I’ve had experiences like that and you guys portrayed it well,’” said Andrew Gord ’20, who played Peter, the film’s protagonist who eventually ascertains his need to quit his addiction.

Gord said he prepared for his role by watching existing films recommended to him by Davis that portray substance abuse. “I was kind of struck by … (those films’) degree of glorification of addiction,” Gord added. “There was something (portrayed as) poetic and beautiful in it.”

The film crew is still in the process of applying for other festivals, but Davis, Holmes and Capron have already begun production for their next project, “Issued at Random,” which is another message-oriented short film, Davis said. It presents a love story that addresses eating disorders, inspired in part by Holmes’ personal experiences, he added.

The directors plan to release “Anybody in There” for free online soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Public Humanities Lab to feature student-curated exhibits</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage will host its first annual Public Humanities Lab from Feb. 20 to March 20. The new iniative will transform the Carriage House Gallery of the Nightengale-Brown House into a venue for student-curated exhibitions, installations and pop-up experiences.

The Public Humanities Lab was devised by an eight-member graduate student committee headed by Marisa Brown, the assistant director of programs  at the center. The student curators are all graduate students completing a degree in Public Humanities.

The Lab aims to give Public Humanities students an opportunity to develop hands-on curatorial experience, Brown said. “A lot of our students go on to work in museums and galleries and places where they do exhibition work. ... (The Lab) is a nice way to give the students a chance to curate their own exhibitions in a gallery, not work as assistants on an exhibition or do it as part of a class project,” she added.

The idea for the Public Humanities Lab “came out of a discussion about wanting to showcase student projects and think more about student work-in-progress,” said Bryn Pernot GS, a member of the committee and co-curator of  the program’s first scheduled exhibition.

The experiential exhibition curated by Pernot and Alyson Myer GS, “Escape the Haffenreffer: Behind the Scenes,” showed from Feb. 20 to 22 and was an escape-room prototype centered around ideas about anthropology and archaeology in practice. The Lab offered Pernot and Myers an “opportunity to test out the narrative elements of the game” before its finished product comes to the Haffenreffer Museum this spring.

In designing the exhibition, “the fun part (was) thinking about how to gamify education while also being aware of the ethics and particular questions that are facing anthropology museums,” Pernot added.

This week’s exhibition, entitled “Monument-Worthy: Personal Memory Markers,” challenges commonly held ideas about monuments, memory and meaning. The installation was curated by Hannah Mooney GS and Molly Pailet GS, two first-years in the Public Humanities program who are interested in pursuing careers in public history and museum education.

“There are all these monuments and memorials everywhere that people just walk by, or interact with, and are these places all meaningful? Maybe not,” Mooney said. “So what are actual meaningful things for people?”

This question drove the curation of the exhibit’s content. The artwork was supplied by Brown undergraduates, graduate students, Rhode Island School of Design students, some community members — including an artist-in-residence at AS220 — and friends of the curators from as far away as Denver. Each “monument” has a distinct character and voice.

“Some are broad to the human experience, others are important to (the artists) and their personal experiences,” Pailet said. One work, called “A Monument to Capitalism,” features United Airlines’ MileagePlus air awards card and an iPhone in adjacent bejeweled temples. “The glow from our iPhone’s apps illuminates our lives in the way that churches’ stained glass once did” begins the monuments’ accompanying statement. Another work, a “Monument to Wellness,” features a bouquet of flowers inside of a biohazard waste container, functioning as a monument to “the spiritual death” that the artist experienced on the day of her diagnosis with Crohn’s disease. Furthermore, two works addressed the Charlottesville incident.

“It’s a great thing the gallery is open to the public — not just the Brown community — and a lot of the things that the students are working on are really timely, interesting and provocative,” Brown said. “We didn’t know quite what we were going to get, or what the programs would look like, but I was just really excited when we put it all together. The gallery features “such a diversity of points of view and kinds of projects,” he said.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s near silent in Stages of Freedom, a quaint bookstore on 10 Westminster St. The only sound that fills the store is the soft and rich timbre of the voice of Ray Rickman, Stages of Freedom’s executive director.

For Rickman, Stages of Freedom is a sacred place where no arguing is allowed. It is a space for people of all walks of life to purchase cheap books, learn about African-American history and confront the fact that black children are more likely to lose their lives to drowning than white children.

Rickman and Robb Dimmick, Stages of Freedom’s program director, started the nonprofit four years ago and moved to Downcity June 1, 2017. All of the books in the store are donated and all profits help finance swimming lessons for children of color at YMCAs around the state, Rickman said.

Rickman prides himself on keeping his word. Five years ago, when Rickman worked as a Rhode Island State Representative, a woman whose son had just drowned at Lincoln Woods State Park in Lincoln, R.I. asked him if he could help persuade the coroner to release her son’s body. With Rickman’s help, the coroners eventually did so.

“(The coroners) said it was superfluous and useless to do an autopsy,” Rickman said. “The mother was already in unbelievable pain” and to add to her pain would be unethical, Rickman said. “In the parking lot, I told the mother that I’d do something about this problem of black children drowning, and I’m very happy in myself in that I keep my word.”

Stages of Freedom’s mission is to confront a difficult stereotype and reality for many African-Americans — a stereotype stemming from slavery.

“During slavery, 50 percent of all plantations were on a river or lake, so (there was) no swimming for black people at all (because they would) swim away to freedom,” he said. “After that, 80 percent of black people lived in the segregated, racist South in which there are no swimming pools, no Y(MCA), no nothing.”

Now black children drown five-and-a-half times more than white children, Rickman said. Furthermore, a large percentage of black and Latinx people lack the income to pay for a membership and swimming lessons at the YMCA, Rickman added.

“(Swimming) is just not their first priority,” Rickman said. “First priority is rent and food and transportation — and swimming would have to be number 10 on your list, if you were even interested.”

Last summer, Stages of Freedom paid for swimming lessons for 400 youth of color. However, Rickman and Dimmick’s goal is to eventually put 2,000 children into lessons.

“(Children of color drowning) is a health disparity in which the government takes no interest, in which the (Alpert) Medical School takes no interest,” Rickman said. “No one has ever done this. I doubt anyone has even put 10 kids into pools. So we’re successful. We’re just in a hurry.”

Stages of Freedom also organizes events, exhibits and lectures about topics ranging from the history of runaway slave ads to black churches. Their next event is a free and open reading of Maya Angelou’s “And Still I Rise” March 25 at 2pm at 75 North Main St., the First Baptist Church in America.

Rickman and Dimmick participate in advocacy as well. In November, the pair proposed that the city change the name of Magee Street, named after a slave ship captain, to Bannister Street to commemorate 19th century local black activists Edward and Christiana <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/31/magee-street-renamed-bannister-st/">Bannister.</a>

“As the South was taking down statues of Confederate soldiers, we seized on the moment and dedicated the street to an extraordinary African American couple,” Dimmick said.

Rickman and Dimmick expected to see droves of students flock the bookstore, but after nine months of being open, they have yet to see such numbers.

“All we need is Brown students to show up and spend 10 bucks three or four times a year. Do you know how much money that would be?” Rickman said. “The world can change, and it can change for the better.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Brown University Orchestra performed “Love Song to the Sun” to accompany the song’s composer and electric violin soloist Tracy Silverman in the first concert of the semester Saturday. After the previous night’s performance was canceled due to inclement weather, Saturday’s concert brought a packed house of eager students, faculty and community members. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Love Song to the Sun” follows the life of a gnat over 24 hours as it experiences birth, mating and death. In bringing the “level of what we would normally consider an insignificant creature to operatic … dimensions,” the piece makes the point that “every living thing has the right to life,” Silverman said. This concept “was the sort of parable of this piece — and in order to make that point, the music had to be very emotional,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The theme’s ramifications could expand to the way humans view the “hierarchy of people in our lives,” said Todd Winkler, professor of music and director of the doctoral program in multimedia and electronic music experiments, who created a video that accompanied the music and was projected on a screen behind the orchestra. “The video had to be compelling in order to draw people into this story,” Silverman said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though trained as a composer, this was the first time Winkler created a video with a live musician, as well as the first time he created a video for another person’s music. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The idea to combine music and video “started from this idea of re-envisioning the way a performer is on stage,” Silverman said, emphasizing that he wanted to create a “virtual self of myself that would be able to transform my appearance the way I transform my sound … to more fully embody the music,” Silverman added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The visuals were not meant to completely pull the audience away from the performers, but rather, to enhance the performance by acting as a window into Silverman’s mind, Winkler added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I want the audience to see what I see in my head, and I don’t want to break that magic by having them look at me,” Silverman said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Silverman, therefore, had to participate “visually as a player on the screen, rather than just be completely separate,” Winkler explained. He compared the score of the orchestra to the trajectory of the video. “In my mind, … the video score is right there in every measure, almost like it’s another instrument, … really integrated into the whole texture of the piece,” Winkler said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">At times, the projected images were slow-moving or static, depicting underwater scenes or the gnat’s-eye view of a pond. Motion detecting cameras allowed Silverman’s figure to be transposed onto the moving background, with different shapes and lines composing his form as the music changed. At the climax of the piece, computer-generated yellow orbs circled around his sihouette, growing and converging. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Love Song to the Sun” was co-commissioned by Brown along with the Vanderbilt University Orchestra, Anchorage Symphony and Rogue Valley Symphony — which have all previously performed the same piece with Silverman. While the piece was commissioned two years ago and was intended to be performed last semester, it was pushed until this concert due to conflicts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Silverman is a Juilliard-trained musician who has been at the forefront of the creation of the six-string electric violin since the 1980s, he said. At Saturday’s concert, he played his custom violin, which adds two lower strings to the usual four. Silverman left the classical world and traditional violin to move his sound closer to the guitar “because the guitar is more of an instrument of our current culture than the violin,” Silverman said. Different post-classical playing techniques, which he introduced to the string players in the University orchestra during workshops, include what he calls “strum bowing” to allow for a more rhythmic sound. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The concert began with “Overture to ‘Candide,’” which was chosen by Conductor and acting Music Director Daniel Harp in recognition of the 100th birthday of its composer, Leonard Bernstein, whose music is being played around the world this year in celebration, Harp said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The concert concluded with “Symphony No. 2 in D Major, Opus 43,” by Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. Sibelius was “very, very sensitive to nature, and much of his music is about his feelings about nature or his responses to being in nature,” Harp said, drawing a connection between this choice and Silverman’s focus on the life of an insect. Sibelius incorporates intellecual elements as well as natural ones to create “a very dynamic, elemental nature to the music,” Harp said. “It’s like music you could imagine if you were standing on a mountaintop, or music you would imagine looking at an iceberg.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“The Wall,” an exhibit by Gregory Thielker that examines the partitions along the U.S.-Mexico border, opened Thursday in the Cohen Gallery in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts as well as the first and third floors of the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. The work emerged as a result of interdisciplinary collaboration between Thielker, a New York City-based visual artist, and Paja Faudree MFA’92, associate professor of anthropology.

“There’s a need to challenge the expected images and stories that are told about the border, about migration,” Thielker said. “We’re very familiar with seeing a certain kind of imagery through photojournalism.”

The exhibit in the Cohen Gallery features hyperrealistic, monochromatic paintings that depict the border in all of its varied forms, as well as sculptures composed of objects left by people crossing the border that Thielker collected on-site, Thielker said. These objects include backpacks, water bottles, clothes and pieces of fabric worn by people around their shoes to conceal their footprints, the artist added.

Over the past two years, Thielker has criss-crossed various segments of the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border, creating sketches along the way. Faudree joined Thielker in January to conduct ethnographic interviews with people living along the Rio Grande Valley and adjacent areas of the border lining Texas, including undocumented immigrants, border patrol agents, artists and researchers, he added.

Beyond just the Mexican and Central American immigrants they expected to meet, Faudree and Thielker met people from all around the world seeking asylum, including people from Cuba and Ukraine.

“People talk a lot about the border, talk about immigration,” Faudree said. “But when you’re actually spending time on the border, there’s a lot of variability.”

When he approached his subjects, Thielker shared his sketchbook, which is now on display at the Cohen Gallery. One woman at a Catholic refugee center broke down crying upon seeing an image of barbed wire in his sketchbook, he said. “She talked about her own experience crossing, and it was very emotional,” he added. “She could tell that I was really invested, … (that I was) not just going to be writing something up and walking away.”

While Thielker’s paintings in the Cohen Gallery explore the border’s visual and aesthetic properties, the exhibit in the Watson Institute imbues the project with a sense of humanity, Faudree said. The Watson Institute portion displays photographs taken by both Thielker and Faudree, as well as excerpts from interviews the two conducted.

“It was about giving space ... for the voices of people who can’t be here because they can’t travel past the checkpoint,” Faudree added. The exhibit tries to “hold these different parts of the story against each other.”

Thielker and Faudree held a public discussion about their collaborative research at the Joukowsky Forum last Wednesday in addition to a reception the next day celebrating the exhibit’s opening in the Cohen Gallery, Thielker said. Before arriving at the University, “The Wall” showed at the Castor Gallery in New York City and at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, he added. The Brown Arts Initiative chose Thielker’s exhibit from a pool of 300 submissions because it was “collaborative and engaged” and demonstrated the artist’s deep commitment to connecting with audiences at the University, said Program Manager Sophia Lacava-Bohanan MA’15.

“I normally work in areas of contested territory, areas where there’s a history of conflict,” Thielker said. According to the artist’s website, his past work has investigated other sites around the world: “(Un)governed Spaces” depicts the rich and complex history of the Shomali Plain in Afghanistan, while “Highway” touches upon the modernization of the ancient Grand Trunk Road in India.

“The Wall” is “more than just art, it’s more than just ethnography,” Thielker said. “It’s important to understand the ambiguity” of the border’s manifold nature.

The exhibit will be on display until March 22.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Photography was not born a mass medium. It had to be converted into one through creative work on its technologies, as well as its formats, production, distribution processes, marketing and more.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Those words were spoken in the List Art Center yesterday by award-winning author and scholar Michael Leja, who is one of the “pre-eminent scholars in the field of American Art,” according to Professor of History of Art and Architecture Douglas Nickel. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Leja, a professor of the history of art at Penn, was the honorary speaker at the 2018 Annual Anita Glass Memorial Lecture. His presentation, titled “The Langenheim Brothers at Niagara Falls: Photographic Fusions and the Mass Marketing of Photography,” explored Frederick and William Langenheim’s contributions to the production and consumption of photography in the mid-1800s. From taking the first set of panoramic photos of Niagara Falls to developing the technology that resulted in the mass distribution of landscape stereographs, these brothers deserve “much of the credit or blame for developing the mass marketing of photographs and a mass market for them,” Leja said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nickel, who teaches Leja’s writings in her classes, said Leja “is interested in trying to redefine the way we do art history by looking at the materials that aren’t necessarily famous masterpieces of painting and sculpture. His interest is in how pictures were used by average people in the past, which, if you think about the Internet and the way that we’re bombarded with images now, is an interesting way to think about doing archaeology about the present moment.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Leja’s lecture primarily focused on the composition of the Langenheim brothers’ Niagara Falls panorama and its popular reception. The talk lasted for a little over an hour and was attended by a large number of students, artists and community members.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dominic Bate GS, who studies art history, said he was “really intrigued by what (Leja) said about the way that the … Langenheim Brothers tried to figure touristic experience itself” through their depictions of Niagara Falls.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Katherine Chavez ’19, who is double concentrating in art history and visual art, said she attended the event with her thesis in mind. “I really liked how the position of the viewer is strange in a lot of the photos — it’s not a viewpoint that you’d be able to have if you went to the actual location,” Chavez said. “It kind of disrupts traditional understandings of photography as representing a reality, so there’s a little bit of a disconnect there — a disembodied experience.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Saodat Ismailova Talk and Film Showing </b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Join Uzbek filmmaker Saodat Ismailova at a joint panel discussion-dinner Sunday afternoon at the Rhode Island School of Design Tap Room. Ismailova will be joined at the event by Ted Levin, professor of music at Dartmouth; Shahzad Bashir, professor of Islamic humanities and religious studies; and Katie Freeze GS, who specializes in ethnomusicology. Entitled “The Inspiration of Tradition: Central Asian Cool,” the event will unpack modes of storytelling and iconography of women in Islamic mythology. Ismailova’s filmography includes “Zukhra” (2013), “40 Days of Silence” (2014) and “The Haunted” (2017). Her latest, “Qyrq Qyz (Forty Girls),” is a live music film depicting the performances of women from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Karakalpakstan, and will feature at the RISD auditorium Wednesday, March 14 at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>‘Silenced Voices’</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">“Silenced Voices,” an exhibition by artist Raphael Díaz, will open Thursday on the second floor of the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. The installation considers the artist’s experiences with a range of cultures, including his own Cuban heritage and culture. Díaz’s exhibition comes as the next in the Art at Watson initiative and will be on display through May 31.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>‘A Human Being Died That Night’</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Catch the debut of the Sandra Feinstein-Gamm Theatre’s production of “A Human Being Died That Night” tonight. Directed by Judith Swift, the production stars Kourtney Adams and Jim O’Brien. It is based on Nicholas Wright’s adaption of the eponymous book by Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela that grapples with police brutality in the era of South African apartheid. The play will run in the Gamm Theatre through April 1. Tickets range from $44 to $60.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>‘The Wolves’</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">This weekend, the Downspace will host Production Workshop’s production of “The Wolves” by Sarah DeLappe. Directed by Marielle Burt ’19, the play poignantly navigates the liminal experiences of a high school girl’s soccer team. The production premieres Friday at 8 p.m., and will have additional showings on Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Sunday at 8 p.m. and Monday at 8 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Students moving into their dorms each year are faced with familiar questions: Should they curate the perfect display of photos featuring the optimal balance of high school friends, family and travel experiences? Or perhaps their time is better spent compiling posters to display alternative music choices and civil engagement. Some may eschew these considerations to focus on finding the perfect mattress to ensure that they get their eight hours of sleep.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These questions have implications for students’ well-being, as living spaces can considerably impact their mental health, according to several students interviewed by The Herald. Though Brown has the reputation of being the “chillest” Ivy with the “happiest” students, mental health issues and their stigmatization remain a pervasive challenge </span>confronting students<span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of the many elements of a room, students find lighting to be an essential component of a healthy living space. Dara Bernstein ’18 remarked that the “overhead light” in her Champlin Hall room made her feel as though she was “living in a hospital.” After moving to an off-campus location, where she employs a carefully chosen mix of lamps and even a lavender oil diffuser, she has noticed that her mood has improved. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For many students, Providence weather can also adversely affect mental health. One senior, who requested anonymity to discuss his challenges with mental health, said he has struggled with seasonal affective disorder. To combat SAD, he uses a specific type of light, which he credits with diminishing symptoms during the winter. On the other hand, Francie Holte ’19 and Talia Curhan ’20 pointed out their need for darker rooms, explaining that this lack of light helps them relax. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Students interviewed expressed a wide range of motivations behind choosing their room decorations, creating different environments in the process. Isabel Blalock ’18 said she chooses decorations that add familiarity to her space, such as art painted by friends and other “eclectic finds” from thrift stores. Blalock has discarded specific decorations she associates with darker times living in “the dormitory cell that is” the Graduate Center, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Holte also said she hangs art painted by her sister and other decorations that remind her of her home in California. Since moving into her new apartment, she feels as though she can effectively escape from the “bubble” of Brown that can be “suffocating” at times, she added. Holte has experienced a newfound ability to “reset” in her room that was lost while living in Keeney Quadrangle and Harkness House, she added. Even though Holte’s off-campus housing is in a basement, she has created a homey environment by being aware that her physical space affects her mental space. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Another senior, who requested anonymity to discuss her challenges with mental health, reflected on her negative experience living in the “dungeon” of Grad Center. Because her anxiety was exacerbated by physical conditions at the time, she developed a reliance on substances. After moving off-campus and taking control of the preparation of her own food, she has felt an overall improvement in her mental health, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Buying a new lamp or adding a brightly colored duvet will not cure a mental illness, but students noted that awareness of their personal space allowed them to make beneficial changes to improve their mental health.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Battle of the Bands winners to play alongside professional acts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Brown Folk Festival’s coordinating committee held its fifth annual Battle of the Bands Friday to decide which student folk artists will have the honor of performing alongside professional acts in the Brown Folk Festival in April. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The competition, which was held in the Underground and was widely attended by both Brown students and community members, was judged by a 12-member student committee that books performers from across the country and coordinates adjunct activities for the two-day festival. According to Thea Monje ’19, one of the festival’s leading coordinators, the committee holds Battle of the Bands because its members love to integrate on-campus folk groups into the lineup. The committee aims to make the Battle of the Bands’ selection process as inclusive as possible. “We like to make the festival really inclusive to everybody’s definition of folk, … anyone who wants to play can play,” Monje said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">This year, the winners were Charlie Steinman ’20, a solo artist who sang a number of poignant-yet-humorous original songs, and sisters Kate Reed ’21 and Herald senior staff writer Allie Reed ’21, a cello-violin duo who performed a set of playful American, Scottish and Gaelic fiddle tunes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I wasn’t expecting there to be so many people. … They were all really enthusaistic after each song, which was comforting,” Allie Reed said about the Battle’s atmosphere. Steinman and the Reed sisters will open for seven to eight professional folk acts from across the country, including a number of “snazzy headliner” bands whose names will be revealed in the coming weeks, Monje said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other performers at the event included Patrick Nugent ’21, who performed a mixture of original songs and covers, and David Wingate ’20, who sang covers but occasionally changed the lyrics to appeal to the Brown audience. For example, when covering James Taylor’s “Fire and Rain,” Wingate cheekily swapped the line, “Won’t you look down upon me, Jesus” with, “Won’t you look down upon me, C-Pax.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The competition was informal and relaxed, and audience members were unanimously supportive of their onstage peers. Zack Even ’20 said he “enjoyed the low key atmosphere,” adding that, “everyone was really nice even when (the acts) messed up.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wingate said that while he didn’t think he was “particularly ready for the performance,” he thought that Battle of the Bands would be the “kick in the ass” that he needed to start performing. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Brown Folk Festival will be held April 20 and 21.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Puppetry, painting, performance collide in ‘Erratics’</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thomas Cole’s “The Course of Empire” is a series of five paintings from the 1830s that depicts the rise, peak and eventual destruction of civilization. There is an anxiety underneath the art — a fear of the negative consequences of empire’s excess coupled with a nostalgic longing for a pastoral past.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nearly two centuries later and an ocean away, Cole’s paintings have inspired director Dan Hurlin to create Sock &amp; Buskin’s latest production, “ERRATICS: Scenes from Thomas Cole’s The Course of Empire.” The show loosely followed the same pattern of “The Course of Empire,” artfully interweaving live performance with puppetry, visual effects and musical numbers to grapple with the development and decadence of civilization. Peppered with hints of a tumultuous family structure and a star-crossed romance between a dog and a deer during the apocalypse, the production muses on the destructive effects of time and human folly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the complex nature of the performance’s thematic skeleton left audiences scratching their heads, a logical structure was not necessarily the production’s objective. Instead, the piece performed itself like a dance, sensational perhaps for its absence of apparent order — but not without technique.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“ERRATICS” was defined by its use of bunraku, a traditional Japanese style of puppetry with a chanter, a shamisen player and three puppeteers who operate the head, face and appendages of large, lifelike puppets. Hurlin, known for his puppeteering, trained the cast extensively in the physically demanding art form. The puppets were modeled on some of the actors, mirroring their physical appearances and costumes. Though bunraku artists are traditionally dressed in hooded black robes, the cast of “ERRATICS” mainly doned white and bright blue, blurring the line between the world of puppets and the world of human actors throughout the play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The show also stunned audiences with a remote control piano on the stage. The play began with a cacophonous eruption; the piano keys wriggled rapidly, projected onto a screen with no pianist in sight.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“ERRATICS” achieved a true theatrical experience: By stripping away the burden of a readable plot, the play was able to synthesize an aura that was mystical and grounded in harsh reality, tragic and comedic, off-putting and enrapturing. To echo the sentiments of the audience, “ERRATICS” may be “nonsense,” but it is an effective nonsensicalness rooted in movement, feeling and artistic inspiration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>“A Wrinkle in Time” not worth the time despite powerful cast</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“A Wrinkle in Time,” the latest film from director Ava DuVernay, has such a decent heart that it feels cruel to strike it down. But it’s probably best to come out and say it: “A Wrinkle in Time” is a disappointment — an ambitious, even touching one, to be sure, </span>but a disappointment all the same.</p>
<p class="p4">There was good reason to hope that “A Wrinkle in Time” would be a success. For one, it’s based on Madeleine L’Engle’s novel of the same name, a delightfully weird classic of children’s literature. And DuVernay, who with this becomes the first black woman to ever direct a film with a budget of over $100 million, has a diverse, impressive resume, from sensitive indies, such as “Middle of Nowhere,” to last year’s documentary “13th.” But “A Wrinkle In Time” sees her making a series of unfortunate, sometimes bizarre choices. And while Hollywood could certainly use an injection of the bizarre these days, DuVernay doesn’t quite supply the kind to do the trick this time around.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Meg, played by Storm Reid, is a smart but insecure girl who has become more introverted and difficult since the disappearance of her scientist father, Mr. Murry, played by Chris Pine, four years ago. She lives with her mother, played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, also a scientist, and her genius younger brother, Charles Wallace, played by Deric McCabe. At school, she’s the nerd with the absent father and weird little brother, and endures the taunts of classmates and stern words of the principal.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Soon enough, intergalactic curiosities start filtering into the story, beginning with the arrival of Reese Witherspoon as Mrs.Whatsit, who drops references to Meg’s father. Mindy Kaling as Mrs. Who and Oprah Winfrey as Mrs. Which follow, and together they whisk Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin, a new friend of Meg’s played by Levi Miller, off to find Mr. Murry.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Most of these first scenes feel oddly limp, with the bullying presented as we’ve always seen it — a line of sneering girls standing in a row — and Mrs. Whatsit’s arrival landing with a wonderless thud. The camera stumbles upon her, as if it took a second for the cinematographer — Tobias Schliessler, a marked step down from DuVernay’s previous collaborator, Bradford Young — to point it in the right direction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">This clumsy camera work frames the whole film. That DuVernay should have this problem is surprising, since her show “Queen Sugar” has some of the best compositions on television. But the intentional, character-driven framing that works so well there gets transmuted into something awkward and heavy-handed on the big screen, full of close-ups that at once crowd the audience and distance the characters from each other. The film is not alone here; there’s a crisis of craft in Hollywood right now, and “A Wrinkle in Time” isn’t immune.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That said, the film has its impressive moments. In one scene, Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin fly on the back of a transmogrified Mrs. Whatsit, and the soaring aerial shots are wide-eyed and dazzling. Also, it’s hard not to be delightedly agape at the sight of a one-hundred-foot-tall Oprah.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Indeed, Oprah is indicative of the largely top-rate cast. Other than Miller and McCabe, two typically bad child actors, everyone delivers, including Reid as the protagonist. But best of all is Pine as the absent father, who once again proves himself to be the most talented and versatile <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/chris-pine-monologue/3515007?snl=1">Chris in the business</a>. In one scene, we witness Mr. Murry struggle for any scrap of family that he can hold on to with a heartbreaking desperation that briefly jolts the movie into a genuinely affecting realm.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">But despite her great cast and obvious emotional intelligence, DuVernay can’t escape the flaws of the script. Flitting from place to place across the galaxy, it has a half-baked episodic quality to it, where the individual events and adventures neither build powerfully onto each other nor stand on their own as exciting planetary pit stops. The dialogue, meanwhile, too often leans on empowerment mantras, which range from sweetly well-intentioned to laughably trite. The soundtrack — including a handful of R&amp;B and pop songs written for the film — is similarly ham-fisted.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“A Wrinkle in Time” is very much a children’s movie, and will likely appease — maybe even inspire — the youngsters who see it. For everyone else, it may be a bit of a bore, to be remembered more for the historical landmark it represents than the glittering mess of its plot. And that’s okay. The first $100 million movie directed by a woman was Kathryn Bigelow’s “K-19: The Widowmaker.” Remember it? Neither do I. Bigelow, on the other hand, didn’t fade away, and became the first woman to win the Oscar for best director in 2010 for “The Hurt Locker.” So, if history’s any guide — and I suspect it will be — there’s no need to worry about </span><span class="s4">DuVernay. She’s not going anywhere.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bon Me food truck parks in Providence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

Despite the previous day’s inclement weather, the Bon Me food truck rolled onto Waterman Street to celebrate its grand opening at Brown on March 15. The bright yellow truck attracted several students, who huddled together on the sidewalk to sample free half-portions of the truck’s signature sandwich alongside a Thai basil limeade drink.

Primarily based in Boston and the surrounding areas, Bon Me’s first out-of-state location is Providence, said Elise Yost, marketing specialist for Bon Me. “We wanted to expand further … and we saw a similar market with young professionals and college students (here).”

Bon Me’s menu offers a variety of Asian-inspired eats, ranging from noodle salads to deviled tea egg, a hard boiled egg soaked in a smokey Chinese black tea mixture. “All of our food is really fresh and delicious, and we have a lot of really different options for people who are vegetarian or vegan or gluten intolerant,” Yost said.

“I’m from a place where there’s a lot of Asian food, so it’s nice to have a food truck with these kinds of options,” said Jolie Ren ’21 as she perused the menu plastered on the facade of the truck.

The menu’s signature item is a sandwich inspired by the traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwich, Yost said. The sandwich contains fresh cucumber, fresh-cut red onions and a house-made spicy mayo to provide a “nice spicy kick” instead of the traditional jalapeños, she explained, adding that customers can choose from a range of protein options to fill the sandwich. “Traditionally, we recommend the Chinese Barbecue Pork, (which is) a roasted chopped pork with a lot of different spices,” Yost said. For vegan and vegetarian customers, the food truck always offers a roasted paprika tofu option, which is accompanied by a walnut-based spread.

“(The sandwich) is pretty good,” said Catherine Li ’21, “I’m not a big fan of the radish inside, but I really like the bread and the pork.” Priced at $7, it is “essentially the same price as the banh mi sandwich served at Andrews,” she added.

Bon Me’s menu also has a special drink exclusive to Providence — Iced Dirty Chai, which has been created in collaboration with New Harvest Coffee Roasters.

“We wanted to honor the locale with a collaboration with a local business,” Yost explained. The Iced Dirty Chai is a reflection of both Bon Me’s and New Harvest Coffee Roasters’ menu — “it’s (New Harvest Coffee Roasters’) coffee, (while the spices in the drink) are similar to what we use in our Thai Ice Tea,” Yost said. “It’s a really delicious caffeinated drink that we hope will be really popular with Brown students!”

The food truck can be found on Waterman Street on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and at Kennedy Plaza on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

&nbsp;
<p class="p1"><em>A previous version of this article stated that the truck serves a Thai basil lemonade drink. In fact, the truck serves Thai Basil Limeade. The article also previously stated that the truck serves pork ramen. In fact, the truck does not serve pork ramen. The Herald regrets the errors.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Mutant Tropic,” an exhibit by painter Luis José Aguasvivas Núñez (José Sejo) offers viewers a look into the beautiful yet complicated reality of the artist’s experience and relationship with his home country of the Dominican Republic. The installation, which opened last month on the second floor of the Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs, contributes to the Art at Watson initiative — a program that welcomes more of the visual arts into Watson’s corridors, especially from artists residing in the greater Brown and Providence communities. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There are bridges to be built between the social sciences and the humanities,” said Steve Bloomfield, associate director of the Watson Institute. “One without the other is less strong, less evocative, less compelling and less true.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We at the Watson Institute and Brown University need to be attuned to the production of … local (cultural projects), including the pictorial arts,” Bloomfield added. “The resources of a private university like Brown can be shared with local citizens, particularly in a city like Providence that isn’t greatly economically advantaged.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The exhibit features around 25 paintings ranging from more figurative pieces, which depict tropical imagery of mangoes and plants, to those more abstract, with lines and three-dimensional shapes cutting across expanses of canvas. A few even resemble cubist compositions drenched in vibrant, dizzying palettes of colors.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“His work is very colorful, very Caribbean,” said Raphael Diaz MA’02, a Providence-based artist, educator and long-time friend of Sejo. “It talks about what’s going on in society in big cities today (like Santo Domingo) … and how (people there) try to survive.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The exhibition came to fruition in part as a product of Diaz’s initial efforts. Diaz answered Art at Watson’s general call for exhibits and referred the committee to the work of Sejo, who lives in the Dominican Republic, Diaz said. Besides practicing as an artist, Sejo works for the Dominican Republic’s Ministry of Culture and looks over the production of art in the country. “It is so refreshing and so wonderful because most of the time people think that people (from other countries) come (to the United States) to take … jobs, but many people … give us the beauty of those countries and share with us their life experience,” Diaz said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sejo and Diaz have been friends for 25 years and are both founding members of los Cuatro Puntos, a group of four international artists that travels to countries around the world yearly to engage in dialogue with local artists about their respective works and issues affecting their countries, Diaz said. “Our mission is to bring people together, not to separate people,” Diaz added. “We need to embrace each other because we (are) all a part of this planet.” Diaz’s own exhibit, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/07/arts-culture-roundup/">“Silenced Voices,”</a> is currently on display on the third floor of the Watson. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The artist is a reflection of everything that happens in the world, of suffering, of war,” Sejo said in a talk about his work and the history of Dominican art at the Watson Institute Feb. 8.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to the Watson Institute’s website, Sejo also practices ceramics, design and illustration of children’s text and restoration of altarpieces and sculptures.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sejo’s exhibit will be on display until May 30.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">— With quotes from Sejo’s Feb. 8 talk translated from Spanish into English by Jacob Alabab-Moser</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Performance piece ‘Qyrz Qyz’ reimagines Central Asian epic tale</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Throughout last Wednesday night’s multimedia performance at the Rhode Island School of Design Auditorium entitled “Qyrq Qyz,” the composition of the stage shifted: The only set piece, a black mountain of fabric, was deconstructed and the performers rearranged positions and formations to the beat of the music. The blend of layered voices and instruments created a hypnotic effect, luring the audience, which ranged from young children to adults, into its story. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The project, presented by the Rhode Island nonprofit FirstWorks, the Aga Khan Music Initiative and the Provost’s Office at RISD, was the culmination of two to three years of research and collaboration between its director, Uzbek filmmaker Saodat Ismailova, and contemporary composer Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky. Following the epic story of “Qyrq Qyz” — Turkic for forty girls — the performance told the centuries-old tale of 40 female warriors on a quest to protect their land, sounds and images of Central Asia. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s about female empowerment,” Ismailova said, adding that she hopes this timely piece speaks to the audience in addition to the young female performers she directed. “I really hope that this project will give them a motivation and a belief that they should continue to develop their individuality and express themselves in their art,” as well as proving to the performers “that the woman has a capacity not only to devote herself to a family and children but also have her own individual voice,” Ismailova said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Broken into four parts — earth, air, water and fire — the piece combined traditional music with contemporary film and movement. By creating a performative representation of the story, Ismailova was able to present the narrative to wider audiences, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The film, which was silent during all but a few moments, was projected on a screen behind the performers. The bright colors and light often juxtaposed the darkened stage, the set piece and the simple, black costumes — which strayed from the traditional style and color of such a performance, Ismailova said. “It’s a rethinking of tradition,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Certain images — a blooming white flower, a white horse, stacked colorful mats —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>appeared throughout the performance, their symbolic meaning shifting as the tension in the plot grew, ultimately reaching their final form at the resolution.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the telling of epic poems such as “Qyrq Qyz” remains a vibrant tradition in Central Asia, the last orator of “Qyrq Qyz” passed away in 2004, freezing the story and its tradition in its transcription from 1938, Ismailova explained. Inspired by the story, Ismailova challenged herself with determining what contemporary elements, such as “image, sound, movement, theatrical light and a composer,” could add to the performance, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Theodore Levin, professor of music at Dartmouth, co-produced the project alongside the Aga Khan Music Initiative. “It’s a production of sublime beauty and … artistic imagination,” Levin said, adding that “‘Qyrq Qyz’ is at once ancient and very contemporary,” making it an example of how “the boundlessness of tradition (can) inspire contemporary artistic creativity.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Aga Khan Music Initiative is a cultural development program that works with local musicians in Central Asia and other regions of the world to “revitalize their musical traditions in the post-Soviet era and develop them further into contemporary languages of art,” Levin said. Ismailova had worked with the Initiative in the past, creating nine documentary films on the traditional music of Central Asia. This piece was inspired by a shorter work of film she created on the same topic, which led the Aga Khan Music Initiative to commission Ismailova to combine film with traditional music. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Levin, who has studied Central Asian music for 45 years, still considers himself a student, learning from the performers as he witnesses and discusses their tradition, techniques and “their own creative trajectories,” he explained. “For me it’s like really doing a kind of field work,” Levin said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The performance was the first of three in the FirstWorks Frontier Series. FirstWorks is “dedicated to connecting art with audiences,” said Kathleen Pletcher, FirstWorks’ founder and executive artistic director. “Our whole idea is that we build our community, … (and) we build the fabric of Rhode Island, through world-class performing arts,” Pletcher added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The series continued at the RISD Auditorium Sunday March 18, with a performance by Venezuelan singer Betsayda Machado. The final presentation of the series, a theatrical cinematic portrayal of a coming-of-age story, titled “Lula Del Ray,” will be presented at the Moses Brown School Woodman Family Community and Performance Center on April 7. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Anderson .Paak, NAO to headline Spring Weekend</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anticipation hung palpably in 50 Exchange Terrace’s Narragansett-soaked Stout Irish Sports Pub Tuesday night as students awaited the announcement of the 2018 Spring Weekend lineup. Released at midnight, the roster ranges from hip-hop to avant-garde soul to easygoing pop-rock. NAO and Anderson .Paak will be headlining Friday and Saturday, respectively. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The highly variegated lineup of artists remains unified by a singular imperative: disrupt. “Our theme this year is ‘disrupt’ because we’re trying to disrupt hierarchies and underrepresentation in the music industry,” said Allie Tsuchiya ’18, a member of the Brown Concert Agency. BCA is responsible for organizing Spring Weekend and unveiled the lineup announcement with a video that stressed the theme of “distorting norms” and “disrupting hierarchies.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">English artist NAO’s music comprises more than the sum of her influences’ parts. English dubstep, deep house and funk contribute to her palette of sounds, which maintains a texture at once sensual and abrasive. NAO, whose real name is Neo Jessica Joshua, released her critically acclaimed debut “For All We Know” in 2016 and is working on a new album. Her set will be preceded by Rico Nasty and DRAM. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Saturday’s headliner, Anderson .Paak, is a California-based singer and rapper whose music oscillates seamlessly between mellifluous vocals and hard-hitting trap beats. The artist’s songwriting is complemented by his technical prowess and vocal command, which forge an expansive soundscape. Since releasing his 2016 album “Malibu,” .Paak has appeared on the “Black Panther” soundtrack and has been featured on tracks by SiR and A Tribe Called Quest. Sets by What Cheer? Brigade, Rina Sawayama and Whitney will preface .Paak’s performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This lineup is out of this world,” said Udoka Oji ’18. “Anderson .Paak is coming. That’s crazy.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>— With additional reporting by Annabelle Woodward</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Haffenreffer combines entertainment, education</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">While the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology stands at the edge of the Main Green, it remains relatively unexplored by most students. But last weekend, the museum transformed into an escape room, attracting flocks of students from across campus.</p>
<p class="p4">“It was honestly a lot of fun,” said Clara Choate ’20, who participated in the escape room with a group of her friends. “I had never been in the Haffenreffer before and had no idea what was really even in there,” she continued, adding that the escape room provided her with the opportunity to visit the museum for the first time and discover what was inside.</p>
<p class="p4">“Escape the Haffenreffer” was built and created by Bryn Pernot GS. Last semester, Pernot took a class on informal education in the public humanities department and grew increasingly interested in the emerging practice of escape rooms in museums, she said. “I ended up writing my final paper (for the class) on escape rooms in museums, … and began thinking about what an escape room in a museum would look like.”</p>
<p class="p4">The framework of “Escape the Haffenreffer” is novel: it is the year 2118 and the participants are interns at the Haffenreffer, explained Emily Jackson, museum operations and communications coordinator. The director in the story has discovered a strange, mysterious box in storage with a note that only says that the box was from the year 2018. The participants are made to travel back in time to the previous century to discover how to unlock this mysterious box and figure out what is inside.</p>
<p class="p4">Ensuring that “Escape the Haffenreffer” achieved the right balance of entertainment and education was a key challenge, Pernot said. “The primary aim of a lot of escape rooms is just to be an entertainment space,” she explained, adding that museums face the unique challenge of making sure that fun does not come at the expense of education. In creating “Escape the Haffenreffer,” Pernot needed to make a conscious effort to integrate educational content into all the puzzles that she built, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“It was a really cool idea to bring (an escape room) to Brown and make it part-educational,” said Parisa Thepmankorn ’20. The puzzles, which were adapted to the museum space, had “a good balance of being difficult, but also possible,” Thepmankorn added. “We finished with only a couple of minutes left on the clock, which is an ideal target for all escape rooms.”</p>
<p class="p4">While the quality of the riddles and puzzles in the escape room was impressive, the culmination of the participants’ experience was “less exciting than we had hoped,” Thepmankorn said. Unlike in traditional escape rooms, the participants in “Escape the Haffenreffer” do not actually escape a room, she explained. “You just unlock a box, which is a lot less climatic.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yet, the process leading up to this finale was exciting, she said, adding that “overall, it was a great experience.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Soccer Mommy’ charts sentimentality without cliche</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Skeptics who have yet to listen to the music of indie-rock princess “Soccer Mommy,” the alias of 20-year-old New York University dropout Sophie Allison, might scoff when told the tracks of the facetiously named artist are landing on the “chill” playlists of culturally astute stoner teens everywhere. More jaded listeners might label Allison’s brand as the natural extension of the ironically detached, self-aggrandizing bent that has become synonymous with alt-rock since Pavement. But there’s no predictable, masturbatory aesthetic to Allison or her music. Her anthemic, coming-of-age studio album “Clean” — released on March 2 —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>proves just that.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Clean” is Allison’s proper debut with Fat Possum Records, an independent label that previously released 2017’s “Collection,” Allison’s quite-literal collection of demos and re-worked songs from her self-produced E.P.s, posted to Bandcamp the summer before leaving for college. Jagged, vulnerable and self-aware, the tracks from “Clean” forcefully capture Allison’s longing for self-acceptance. “‘You gon’ be like that,’ is kind of the lesson of the album,” Allison told <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/29/soccer-mommy-clean-cool-scorpio-rising-interview-sophie-allison">The Fader</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On tracks like “Your Dog” and “Cool,” Allison channels ’90s punk-rock angst with a fresh perspective even while singing about frustration, desire and detachment. Throughout the album, Allison futilely pines after a fictive romantic ideal — embodied by the character Mary on the track “Cool.” Defined by a want to be wanted, Allison’s lyricism echoes the universal anxiety of singer-songwriters and situates herself in an illustrious tradition of fruitless longing expressed through song. The album’s edgier songs are offset by the misty, allegorical “Still Clean,” where Allison compares her ex-lover to an animal who picked her out of his teeth. The LP’s climax and crown jewel is “Scorpio Rising” — an apical track in which Allison reflects on nights spent with a boy who she knows is going to leave her for someone else. “And I’m just a victim of changing planets / My Scorpio rising and my parents,” she laments as the final verse crescendos in a sonic variegation that elevates the track beyond mere sentimentality. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it’s inevitable that Allison’s signature pout will wind up lending a provocative aesthetic to many a college dorm room, attempts to commercialize her persona do her an injustice. In the months before the release of “Clean,” The Fader profiled Allison under the headline “Soccer Mommy is 2018’s chillest new rock star” — despite the fact that there is nothing particularly “chill” about the existential tumult behind her lyrics. Though Allison lists young Taylor Swift and Avril Lavigne among her biggest influences, her music is far smarter than theirs. It nails Swift’s cathartic reliability without relying on tropism and lyrically outpaces the “Hey hey / you you” punk angst that Lavigne trademarked in the mid-2000s. Allison’s gift for poetry distinguishes her from rebellious girl-next-doors of yore. Allison’s astuteness, vulnerability and fleshy candor resound beyond the treacly song-writing of her influences while also transcending the self-satisfying obscura and affect of her alt-rock contemporaries. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Ivy Film Festival 2018</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">The Ivy Film Festival, one of the nation’s largest student-organized annual film festivals, will launch its 17th installment Monday. The keynote event will take place April 9 in Salomon 101 from 6 to 8 p.m. and will consist of a screening of “#TAKEMEANYWHERE” and an accompanying address by creators Shia LaBeouf, Nastja Säde Rönkkö and Luke Turner. The festival’s week-long programming also includes the Aegean Film Festival Short Program April 10 and advanced screenings of “RBG” April 11, “On Chesil Beach” April 12, “We the Animals” April 13, “Blindspotting” April 14 and “Eighth Grade” April 15 with accompanying talks by director Betsy West, director Dominic Cooke, author Justin Torres and actor Daveed Diggs ’04, respectively.</p>
<p class="p2">Additional scheduled programming includes a virtual reality arcade, a production workshop with producer Tom Gormican and an official selection by IFF of the 25 best undergraduate and graduate student films.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Writers on Writing: Simone White</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Join award-winning poet Simone White Thursday in McCormack Family Theater at 5:30 p.m. as she reads from her oeuvre as part of the Writers on Writing Reading Series. White is the author of “Dear Angel of Death,” “Of Being Dispersed,” “House Envy of All the World” and the chapbooks “Dolly” and “Unrest.” She received the Whiting Award for poetry and was selected as a New American Poet for the Poetry Society of America.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Sock and Buskin’s “Sometimes the Rain, Sometimes the Sea” </b></span></p>
<p class="p2">“Sometimes the Rain, Sometimes the Sea,” the latest production by Sock and Buskin, will premiere Thursday at 8 p.m. in Leeds Theatre. An experimental interpretation of a seminal fairy tale, the play marks a partial adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Little Mermaid.” Written by Julia Izumi MFA’19 and directed by Kate Bergstrom MFA’18, the show will run through April 15. Tickets are $7 for students, $12 for seniors and $15 for adults.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Weatherproof: Arts, Humanities, and Sciences Explore the Environment</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Over the course of April, five programs at Brown are partnering to host a cross-discipline series that aims to explore pressing environmental issues. Each program approaches the theme in its own way, but the two common threads spanning the series are water and the impact of environmental change on polar regions. The David Winston Bell Gallery is hosting a public art exhibition titled “33°”; the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society’s “Water’s Edge” will feature a seminar, speaker series and poetry reading; the John Carter Brown Library will host an exhibit, sound installation and panel discussion entitled “Fluidity: Knowing Water in the Americas”; the Brown Arts Initiative’s symposium “Polar Opposites: Creative Intervention in the Arctic and Antarctica” will connect artists and scientists; and the Cogut Institute for the Humanities will host the two-day conference “Earth(ly) Matters: New Directions in Environmental Humanities.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3"> Throughout the first half of April, five programs at Brown are partnering to discuss, teach and learn about the environment through a range of perspectives with a focus on collaboration. Through the initiative “WeatherProof: Arts, Humanities and Sciences Explore the Environment,” these distinct programs will weave across barriers to examine environmental issues with a multidisciplinary lens. Each of the events is free and open to the public. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>The Bell Gallery </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The latest exhibition at the David Winton Bell Gallery, “33˚,” focuses on the melting polar ice that is a result of climate change. The keystone of the exhibition is Jacob Kirkegaard’s sound environment, “Isfald (Icefall),” an immersive sound experience housed within a curtained-off section of the Bell Gallery. Produced through the use of tools such as contact microphones and hydrophones, the piece captures the sounds of melting ice caps, ranging from the soft drops of water to loud, booming cracks.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“He’s literally trying to help your ears physically engage with the sound of cleaving ice in the Arctic,” said Ian Russell, curator of the Bell Gallery. Russell added that he hopes “that Jacob’s work touches people, and that maybe it makes people feel like the problem isn’t quite so far away.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Works by contemporary photographers Olaf Otto Becker and Camille Seaman are on view throughout the List Art Building to accompany the “Isfald.” “We prefer to show groupings of work or series,” as the artists are better able to “communicate the extent to how they are viewing or engaging an area or region,” Russell said. But the exhibition extends beyond the walls of the gallery. Five large prints hang off of various campus buildings’ exteriors as public art murals, featuring images by Becker and Seaman as well as photographs by Iain Brownlie Roy, Jean de Pomereu and James Balog. The print located on the List Art Building depicts people standing and posing for photographs on waves of bright white ice.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The exhibition, curated by Director of the Bell Gallery Jo-Ann Conklin, was developed alongside the Brown Arts Initiative’s three-year theme of Arts and Environment, a coordination that Anne Bergeron, managing director of the BAI, said “was very purposeful.” </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Kirkegaard will be speaking at the opening reception of the exhibition April 6, and will present his sound concert “Labryinthitis” April 7. The exhibition will show through May 27.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>The Brown Arts Initiative </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The Brown Arts Initiative symposium, “Polar Opposites: Creative Interventions in the Arctic and Antarctica,” will gather artists, scientists, scholars and musicians, among other experts, to the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“We are bringing together artists and scientists and researchers who are working in a kind of cross-platform way to address something of a great deal of significance to contemporary society,” Bergeron said of the focus on polar regions. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The keynote speaker, filmmaker David Buckland, is the founder and director of Cape Farewell, a multidisciplinary, international effort to culturally respond to climate change. Bergeron said that the program was founded after Buckland came to the realization that the combination of efforts by artists and scientists would allow for a better understanding and approach to the issues of climate change — a mindset similar to the core values of the the BAI and the WeatherProof programs. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“This is … one of the things that Brown does really well — it has porous borders in terms of disciplines and it … regularly reaches out beyond. One of the things that we are trying to do through the construct of WeatherProof is to make that visible,” Bergeron said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The Polar Opposites keynote address and panels, “Knowing Ice” and “Art, Polarities and Politics,” will take place April 5 and 6 at the Granoff Center. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>The Cogut Institute </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Earth(ly) Matters: New Directions in Environmental Humanities,” hosted by the Cogut Institute for the Humanities, will assemble over a dozen speakers in an effort to coalesce multiple fields, ranging from new media arts to the social sciences. The theme of this year’s season at the Cogut Institute is environmental humanities, a theme that has been studied before at the Institute, and that represents a “conjunction of energies” among Institute scholars, said Damien Mahiet, associate director of the Cogut Institute. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“The environmental humanities is really a conglomerate of researchers trying to tackle questions that have to do with how to better live on this planet” from fields beyond those that directly affect life on Earth, said Iris Montero, a postdoctoral fellow at the Cogut Institute. “We’re basically trying to think from our different standpoints about all the ways that we have engaged with nature in the past, how those ways have been communicated through different means in literature, in the different arts, and what those representations … can tell us for future directions,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">While the Cogut Insitute considers today’s issues, its focus extends to the “longer history and broader history of the environment … and the relationship between humans and non-humans,” Mahiet said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The conference serves as an opportunity for scholars to come together and exchange notes, Montero said, while also offering them the opportunity to relay this information to a wider audience. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Earth(ly) Matters will take place April 6 and 7 at the Cogut Institute in Pembroke Hall. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>IBES and the John Carter Brown Library </b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Water’s Edge” is this year’s rendition of the interdisciplinary program “Earth, Itself,” sponsored by the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. The theme of water marks the final element in the fourth year of the series, following the inaugural themes of earth, air and fire. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“The advantage of the classic elements is that it’s accessible in terms of how you think about issues and how ideas have moved forward,” said Lenore Manderson, the director of “Earth, Itself” and visiting professor of anthropology. “I really used a particular element as a theme around which to build questions about the environment, environmental change (and) climate change,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Following a tradition of connecting scientific discussion with related specific art forms, this year’s program focuses on text through two days of poetry readings, as well as discussions around water as an inspiration for writing, Manderson said. A film by Wendy Woodson, “Sourcing the Stream,” was also shown at the opening program April 3 hosted by the John Carter Brown Library, and is now showing in the lobby of the IBES building. </span></p>
<p class="p6">The interdisciplinary approach of the “Earth, Itself” program gears its message toward the general public, Menderson said, while also giving scientists, artists and writers the chance to reflect on each other’s work. She added that this was exemplifed at the opening film screening and its corresponding panel event.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"> “What has been so exciting has been the capacity for people to collaborate or to share a space and to recognize that each reflects on what the other is talking about,” she said, adding that the interdisciplinary approach “gives a legitimacy to the insights that artists provide.” </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Water’s Edge will host events through April 13, including a film night, flash lecture competition, poster competition and various panels. The next seminar, “Writing on Water,” will take place in two sessions over April 12 and 13. The John Carter Brown Library exhibition, “Fluidity: Knowing Water in the Americas,” will show from May 1 to June 30, following the opening symposium that took place April 3.</span></p>
<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that the theme of this year’s season at the Cogut Institute for the Humanities is environmental humanism. In fact, the theme is environmental humanities. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A conversation with John Krasinski ’01</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/05/conversation-john-krasinski-01/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For nearly a decade, John Krasinski ’01 was best known for his role as Dunder Mifflin paper salesman Jim Halpert on the NBC comedy “The Office,” playing pranks on Dwight and staring down the camera with a knowing expression and a charming shrug. But in his third directorial endeavor, “A Quiet Place,” Krasinski breaks away from comedy with a horror film set in an apocalyptic world where even the slightest noise results in a violent death by human-eating creatures. The film, released today, underscores the importance of family in a pervasively threatening environment. Krasinski crafts the story of two parents ­— played by Krasinski and his wife Emily Blunt — and their young children who must learn to fiercely protect one another in the fight for survival. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Reading the script for “A Quiet Place” just three weeks after the birth of his second daughter, Krasinski said the thread of family immediately hit home. “I was already in a state of terror about whether or not I was a good enough father,” he said in a conference interview with The Herald and other university publications. Imagining being a father in a nightmare world who is so dedicated to keeping his children alive elevated the meaning of parenting to him, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This focus on family and parenting weaves throughout the entire plot as a central theme that parallels the terror, Krasinski said. Though the film has its jumpy moments, he wanted the audience to experience fear in direct correlation with love for the family. “If I can make you fall in love with this family, then you’ll be scared because you don’t want anything to happen to them,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As actor, producer and writer, Krasinski donned various hats, in addition to his role as a father in real life, to cement the family’s interdependence and center the rest of the movie around their inseparability. For him, the film is “a love letter to (his) kids.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Krasinski also regularly turned to his on-screen and real-life wife Blunt for her input and ideas. Although it was their first time working together on the same set, Blunt went above and beyond in being a collaborative contributor, giving Krasinski notes on the script and shots and being present whether or not her character acted in the scene, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Together, Krasinski and Blunt generated ideas about how to inject horror into the film. As a self-proclaimed “scaredy-cat,” Krasinski drew from his own instincts to decide what fear factors would play most effectively in each scene. While writing, Krasinski would imagine himself in the scene and think about what would scare him most and then write that very image or action into the script.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Silence plays a critical role in the film — nearly the entire first half of the screen time contains no dialogue, and the entire script is only 67 pages. But as the cast shot these scenes, Krasinski said he learned about the value of such stillness in a distractingly noisy world. “We just sat in the forest and we listened, and it was really powerful to have all of these ambient sounds around you,” he said. Krasinski has since started taking his daughter outside to “just look up at the sky and listen.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The family in the movie goes to painstaking lengths to remain silent and ensure safety by putting sand down when they walk through the forest, painting floorboards so that they don’t creak and communicating through American Sign Language. The cast learned ASL together from deaf actress Millicent Simmonds, who played the deaf daughter in the film.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There’s no better teacher for ASL than Millie because she was so kind and gentle,” Krasinski said. “I’ve never had someone take in all of me when we were communicating.” Simmonds taught the cast about how each individual has their own version of sign language — for example, the father, who focuses on keeping the children safe, has very curt and short signs, whereas the mother, who wants to give the children a larger life, has more poetic gestures. Krasinski cited his biggest regret about his directing experience as having not learned more sign language, as he believes that “there’s no more beautiful language.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Krasinski fondly recalled how his community at Brown opened up a world of exposure, impacting his work today “in every single way.” Every week for all four of his years at Brown, he would ask his group of friends to give him an album or a movie recommendation, helping him grow from a high schooler “who had never seen a movie that wasn’t in a Cineplex or listened to music that wasn’t on the radio” to the actor, director and producer he is today.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I could talk about this forever and I would probably start crying,” Krasinski said. “I legitimately would not be half the person that you see in front of you if it were not for Brown. … I wish I could go back.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A distinctive combination of visual metaphors, color and depth underlies the “Silenced Voices” exhibition, which is currently on display at The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. The exhibition features the work of Cuban-born artist, Raphael Díaz, who explores elements that are both universal and autobiographical, such as migration and the fragility of life. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(Díaz’s work) talks about migration and displacement, (which) are very important themes of intellectual inquiry at the Watson Institute,” said Steven Bloomfield, associate director of the Watson Institute. “There are people suffering all over the world; there are refugees all over the world; there are people crossing borders. … We have a scholarly and a policy interest in those displacements,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The theme of migration in Díaz’s artwork is inspired by his personal experience immigrating to the United States. “I came to the U.S. (when) I was 3 years old, when my mother left Cuba,” Díaz said, emphasizing that leaving Cuba was not his choice. “My work talks about my personal experiences, but also (relates to the experiences) of so many other people,” he said in reference to the DACA recipients and refugees in Europe. “I am a reflection of my society,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Díaz’s paintings are accentuated by varied and bright colors, “upon looking more deeply, one sees anguish and frustration,” Bloomfield said. “What one sees in the paintings are the faces of many people who are … seeking an opportunity to express their voices … (which) don’t seem to be appreciated and (are) in the process of being suppressed.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“‘Silenced Voices’ are about those people who cannot talk,” Díaz explained. “They don’t have a voice, and I would like my art to be a voice for them,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The recurring motifs in Díaz’s work are unmistakably idiosyncratic. For instance, the focus of each painting is a surreal, angel-like figure, with wings made of plantains. “It’s a self-portrait,” Díaz explained. “When I was younger, my mother used to send me to buy plantains” because they were unable to afford more exotic varieties of fruits. “The other children used to make fun of me and call me ‘the plantain boy.’” Rather than succumbing to their derision, Díaz chose to embrace this aspect of his identity by illustrating himself as a ‘plantain angel’ in each of his works. “They say ‘you are what you eat,’ so the plantain angel is me,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other distinctive elements of Díaz’s work include fragile boats and a black-and-white checkerboard. While at first glance, these motifs appear to be a melange of disparate elements, their symbolism is profound. For instance, the boat represents a form of transport for several migrants, Díaz explained, and added that it can also symbolize how people travel from one life into another after death. Meanwhile, the black-and-white checkerboard is a reminder to the viewer that “nothing in life is ever stable.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I definitely noticed the recurring motifs (in the paintings),” said Annie Lehman-Ludwig ’20, an art history concentrator. “The viewer can really look at (Díaz’s) work and see what the ‘silenced voices’ mean,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While migration is a prevalent theme of Díaz’s work, his art also addresses life and its ephemeral quality. “Life is so fragile and we take it for granted,” Díaz said. “As humans, we are always in a rush. We’re always moving from here and there and we never stop to reflect … I would like people to stop and look at my work and reflect,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>John Krasinski’s ’01 ‘A Quiet Place’ makes little noise</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the first scene of “A Quiet Place,” the new film from actor and director <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/05/conversation-john-krasinski-01/">John Krasinski ’01</a>, a family tiptoes around an abandoned general store to gather a few necessities. We hear the soft taps of their bare feet on the linoleum and the slight rattle of pills in a bottle as the mother carefully picks them up. No one speaks, and nothing goes boom. And yet the longer the quiet lingers, the more uneasy we become. It’s an effective opener, putting the audience on edge as they wait for a pin to drop. But it also puts into stark relief what is maybe an obvious realization: Most movies are awfully loud, aren’t they?</span></p>
<p class="p4">The decibel count eventually goes up in “A Quiet Place,” and the movie becomes significantly less interesting when it does. But for a few brief stretches, the film uses silence in a way that sets it apart from most movies of its ilk. The quieter something is, the closer we listen, and “A Quiet Place” occasionally takes this lesson to heart, using it to craft some delicious scares and to deploy tension with admirable finesse. Had Krasinski been more ruthless in sticking to his premise, the film might have been a real nerve-jangling knockout. But as it stands, “A Quiet Place” is decent, scary fun.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The story unfolds in a world ravaged by nonhuman predatory creatures. Gifted with extremely sensitive hearing, they hunt and kill anything within earshot with quick, violent efficiency. The stakes are viscerally established at the beginning of the film when a child, Beau, is snatched up mere seconds after his electric rocketship toy makes noise.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beau’s death will haunt his parents, Lee (Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt), and their other two children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe), for the rest of the film. The four of them live in a country farmhouse surrounded by rows of corn, where they’ve created a viable but always precarious lifestyle amongst the world’s new order of violence. Sand muffles the sound of footsteps on the paths around the property, paint circles mark the floorboards that creak the least, and leaves replace plates to prevent dinnertime clanking. And, of course, the family almost never speaks aloud to each other, instead communicating through American Sign Language.</span></p>
<p class="p4">But they persist. Perhaps the most obvious sign of their optimism is the fact that Evelyn is pregnant, although this comes across as a little more delusional than Krasinski may have intended. Babies are great, but not exactly silent, and the solution the film proposes to this is patently absurd. So is most of the stuff in this movie, as a matter of fact, but nobody likes a pragmatic scold, and I don’t intend to be one.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nothing particularly scary happens for much of the film — we watch the family merely live their lives and act out some dull smudges of emotional drama. The cast, at least, is good, including Blunt — married to Krasinski in real life — and Simmonds, a deaf actress who, between this and last year’s “Wonderstruck,” is shaping up to be one of the most talented young actors in Hollywood. And everything is nicely accented by the fluid cinematography of Charlotte Bruus Christensen.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But at least one scene amidst the film’s more sedate first half really sticks with you: As Lee and Marcus walk back to the farm from a fishing expedition, they come across an old man standing by his wife’s bloody corpse. His face is troubled, his lips curled inward. Just as they start to run, the old man lets loose a mournful scream. In seconds, he is killed. In this world, to scream is to die; to express pain is to be ended by it. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The motif of the scream returns twice more throughout the film, and both moments are among the film’s best. But too much in between lacks urgency or invention. An expert set piece turns into a bloated latter half of a film, story beats are repeated and cheap jump scares crop up like cornstalks in the springtime. Meanwhile, excess noise starts to seep into the film’s meticulous soundscape, from Marco Beltrami’s score to the smorgasbord of overused sound effects. Krasinski spends a lot of his time shushing people in this movie; it’s a shame the same impulse didn’t make it into his direction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As it nears its end, “A Quiet Place” grasps around for a conclusion for a while without ever really finding one, eventually coming to a defiant halt that only works if you don’t think about it for too long. And maybe you shouldn’t. All I know is when the last shot cut to black, the audience clapped and I took my hand away from eyes and said “what’d you think?” to the person next to me, it felt good to speak again.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This Saturday, the literary arts department celebrated the 25th anniversary of Ugly Duckling Presse, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit editorial collective that prides itself on publishing experimental, non-commercial literature, according to head editor and founder Matvei Yankelevich. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The all-day programming included a book display in the John Hay Library, a roundtable of distinguished small press editors and writing-inspired performances and readings by five Ugly Duckling-published writers, including University professors Cole Swensen and Monica de la Torre.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ugly Duckling Presse began as an experimental zine haphazardly assembled by Yankelevich and his friends while they were undergraduates at Wesleyan. By the early 2000s, it had transformed into a volunteer-based, nonprofit editorial collective, publishing chapbooks, books of poetry, experimental nonfiction, performance texts and translations. Today, Ugly Duckling releases over 20 titles a year and was once lauded as the “preeminent nesting ground for swans of the avant-garde poetry scene,” by The New York Times. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ugly Duckling is defined by its longstanding commitment to experimentation. Unlike big-name publishing houses that are all-too-concerned with commercial viability and staying “on brand,” Ugly Duckling strives to “create an experience of artwork that circumvents the utilitarian mode of consumption,” Yankelevich said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re publishing things because we love the work … because it has significance. We’re not really publishing things that will make money,” Yankelevich added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ugly Duckling’s mission was concertedly praised by audience-members and authors throughout the event’s many programs. “I don’t think any other press would have been as adventuresome or open to what we wanted to do,” Swensen said, prefacing excerpts from “Greensward,” a book of poetry that she and graphic artist Shari DeGraw published with Ugly Duckling in 2010. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The programming grounded itself in the Small Press Roundtable, where Ugly Duckling Presse editors Anna Moschovakis and Yankelevich discussed the current challenges facing small presses alongside Patrick Riedy ’18 MFA, Damon Krukowski, Stephen Motika and Visiting Lecturer in Literary Arts Erica Mena — all of whom are also editors of distinguished small presses, including Pressboard Press, Exact Change, Nightboat Books and Anamolous Press, respectively. The featured editors spoke gaily about a range of critical issues — from editorial education to navigating digital distribution to the uncertain fate of the National Endowment for the Arts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We don’t even know if the NEA will even exist next year. It’s a small but significant part of our budget when we get this grant, so it’s always frightening when our funding is in peril,”Yankelevich said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following the roundtable were a number of artistic performances inspired by Ugly Duckling texts, including a dance by Allissa Cardone and Sara June informed by a translation of Tatsumi Hijikata that was recently published by the Presse. Hijikata was a legendary Japanese choreographer in the mid-20th century, and “Costume En Face: A Primer of Darkness for Young Boys and Girls,” is one of the first translations of his notebook notations ever published in English.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(The text) is really dense, there’s such an incredibly rich array of spaces and characters. We both attacked the book and looked at the images,” Cardone said. “I’m a postmodern choreographer … so I was really interested in how to generate movement from it.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Students and community members flocked to Salomon 101 Monday to attend the opening event of the 17th annual Ivy Film Festival, a screening of #TAKEMEANYWHERE, the participatory art piece and short film created by Shia LaBeouf, Luke Turner and Nastja Säde Rönkkö. Following the screening, LaBeouf and Turner took to the stage to answer questions pre-submitted to IFF, as well as those from audience members.</p>
<p class="p2">Composed of 95 Brown and Rhode Island School of Design students, the largest student-run film festival in the world is in its biggest year yet, said managing director of IFF Jake Anderson ’18 in the event’s introduction. The 2018 festival features “seven industry guest speakers, five advanced screenings of studio films, a curated selection of 26 student short films, 15 student screenplays and five student virtual reality pieces, representing 25 countries,” Anderson said. The selection of short films will also show at 20 satellite locations across the globe.</p>
<p class="p2">The festival’s keynote feature, #TAKEMEANYWHERE, is the product of a month-long project by LaBeouf, Turner and Rönkkö to “hitchhike the internet” during summer of 2016. The trio posted their geographic coordinates online and opened their lives up to strangers to allow them to direct the artists’ adventure. Beginning in Boulder, Colorado, the team traversed the American Southwest, and moved eastward before climbing north and charting the U.S.-Canada border to eventually land in Alaska.</p>
<p class="p2">“Each night going to bed … your head would hit the pillow after a long day that was different than the previous day and you’d go to bed thinking anyone could turn up in the morning,” Turner said. “Anything could happen.”</p>
<p class="p2">However, LaBeouf noted that the team did not intentionally put themselves in harm’s way along the trip, and could have refused rides they felt were dangerous. “We didn’t encounter any kind of negative energy at all,” LaBeouf added.</p>
<p class="p2">Commissioned by the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art and the Finnish Institute in London, the project originated in response to the theme of “corruption” that was highlighted by the Boulder Museum’s performance art festival, MediaLive, LaBeouf said. But the idea had been on their minds already, with its roots in an earlier work by Rönkkö with the same title in which she rode a horse blindfolded. The artists even looked to Dr. Seuss’ “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” for inspiration, LaBeouf added. “So, the internet was our horse,” Turner said.</p>
<p class="p2">Known for his roles in blockbuster films such as “Transformers” and “Fury,” his time on Disney Channel as Louis on “Even Stevens,” and more recently his pieces of performance and participation art, such as the YouTube sensation, “Just Do It.”, LaBeouf reached out to Turner after discovering his work including his 2011 “The Metamodernism Manifesto,” and the duo met soon after in London. Turner connected LaBeouf with Finnish performance artist Rönkkö — whom he’d known since college — and the trio formed.</p>
<p class="p2">“We hatched a plan and two weeks later Shia turns up on the red carpet in Berlin with a paper bag over his head saying “I’m not famous anymore” on it and it became huge,” Turner said. “We never looked back.”</p>
<p class="p2">The film is as much a story of their journey — an image of the America they encountered — as it is a collection of the stories of the people they met along the way: One man showed off his collection of sneakers, a woman talks of her short-lived marriage after high school, a group drives from Florida to meet them in Alaska for a matter of minutes before turning back. Later, the film features a conversation between the artists and a man, who, while speeding down the highway, attempts to teach them how to load and shoot a gun. This interaction contrasts with that between the trio and the next group of participants along their journey — a large Mormon family who welcomes them into their home. The film was met with many bouts of laughter, as it depicted the realistic and relatable nature of the journey while it maintained and portrayed the serious essence of the participants’ stories.</p>
<p class="p2">“People open up really quickly and talk about the most personal things,” Turner said, and added that “it’s almost like people come to art to experience those things and express them.” This expression “became a kind of theme of the film,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Participants in the project appear in the film in different ways — some only audibly, some only visually, while others still do not appear at all. “Some people will open up to you only when the camera’s gone, some people see a camera and immediately open up,” LaBeouf said.</p>
<p class="p2">All of the participants have remained connected through a Facebook group constructed along the journey, LaBeouf and Turner explained. “Thankfully, this work — perhaps more than others — has this community that’s built around it,” Turner said.</p>
<p class="p2">“This is pre-Trump, this is … a different America. So, it was just different, it was just a different landscape. It wasn’t as fired up — as divisive,” LaBeouf said.</p>
<p class="p2">In 2016, LaBeouf, Rönkkö and Turner responded to the election results by collaborating on the performance piece hewillnotdivide.us, which invited people to repeat the phrase “he will not divide us” in reference to President Trump. The project began the day of the inauguration at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, with plans for it to be livestreamed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the duration of Trump’s presidency.</p>
<p class="p2">“Nobody wants to be cool anymore, but everybody wants to be relevant, and so … there’s nothing more relevant than being here,” Labeouf said. “It’s the biggest student-run film festival and that just feels very, very relevant.”</p>
<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Shia LaBeouf  played Steven in "Even Stevens." In fact, he played Louis in "Even Stevens." The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>B-Side Spring Coffeehaus adds to Underground hum</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Live music complimented the distinctive hum of The Underground Coffee Co. Saturday afternoon as the B-Side Magazine hosted its annual spring Coffeehaus show, which featured various student performers and groups.</p>
<p class="p2">“Sometimes at Brown if you’re doing something that’s not quantifiable in terms of a grade, or a thesis, or an internship, it doesn’t always get recognized,” said Michael O’Neill ’19, managing editor of B-Side. “I wanted to put on an event where students can perform and (display) these skills, and others can come and watch.”</p>
<p class="p2">The lineup of featured student musicians included performers Drew Wendel, Sofia Frohna &amp; Friends, Cat Carignan, Alidade, Julia Hava, The Schapiro 17 and Tourist Tortoise.</p>
<p class="p2">“I really like The Underground as a space for more singer-songwriter artists,” said Drew Wendel ’19, one of the performers, who describes her music as “singer-songwriter, very stripped-down and acoustic.” The intimate setting of The Underground is ideal for such performances, and harmonizes well with Coffeehaus’s intention of bringing people together in a small space and making student artists heard, she elaborated.</p>
<p class="p2">“The event had a really cool laid-back vibe,” said Charlie Saperstein ’21, a writer for B-Side. “People were streaming in and out, doing homework, stopping by — and I think everyone really appreciated the performers,” he continued.</p>
<p class="p2">Hosting the event at The Underground is mutually beneficial to both the student-run coffee shop and the featured artists, O’Neill said. “The Underground gets more business from the extra audience and the students get the opportunity to show off stuff they’ve worked really hard on,” he explained.</p>
<p class="p2">Following the spring Coffeehaus, B-Side will host their annual tent show April 25, which will showcase a variety of student performers in an outdoor setting.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“My favorite part of (hosting these events) is giving people a platform to perform and getting to meet so many people on campus who are so incredibly good at making music,” O’Neill said, and added that such events help showcase the variety of student acts on campus.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who frequent the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs may have noticed the addition of two black vinyl tape lines running parallel in a geometric pattern across the side of the building’s staircase. As part of “Re-thinking the Wall: Greek and Chilean Street Art at Brown,” Greek and Chilean artists created street art pieces in the Watson Institute and outside the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts this April, which remain on display. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosted by the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies and organized in part by Grace Monk ’18, the show included painting demonstrations by Greek street artist Chris Tzaferos, also known as Simek, and pieces by Chilean artists Juan Lara Hidalgo and Francisco Verdugo Navea. The art was accompanied by a trilingual panel discussion that explored the artists’ work and creative processes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The opportunity to think about the public and somewhat ephemeral nature of what they do was interesting,” said Steven Bloomfield, associate director of the Watson Institute. “They’re quite aware of what will degrade and change and what will gather people’s attention, which is entirely different from a museum or gallery space.” Bloomfield added that the artists defended the integrity of their street art as “a counterpoint to something that might be more private and perceived as more permanent.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Monk said that translating two foreign languages into English contributed a unique lens and filter to an international perspective, while the painting displays also added to the conversation at Brown about urban space.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Street art is not something we do a ton with here (at Brown) even though I think people are very interested in the themes it pertains to,” Monk said. As part of her senior thesis on street art capitals Athens, Greece and Valparaíso, Chile, she felt it was important to bring attention to public art, culture and especially pieces created by low-income artists to help diversify artistic voices on campus. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The painting demonstrations and discussion also offered Brown students the opportunity to look at “the production of the art and space both in a local context and in a global context,” said Damien Mahiet, associate director of the Cogut Center for the Humanities, which helped fund the artists coming to Brown, along with the Watson Institute and other departments.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hidalgo works with Mapuche identity, that of an indigenous community in South America, while Navea’s work grapples with the concepts of consumption and immigration.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ‘art’ that I do explores a lost identity,” Hidalgo wrote in an email to The Herald. In Latin America, there is an admiration for foreign cultures, while the countries’ own cultures are viewed negatively, he explained. Through his artwork, he aims to draw attention to the deterioration of Latin American culture. “I want people to love their roots more and stop looking at Latin America as something bad and with a certain sense of mockery,” he wrote.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, Monk says the artists are also thinking about “issues of immigration and identity, and how to bring the Chilean complexities about those same issues into their work here.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simek primarily plays with geometry, lines and patterns in urban spaces to create therapeutic and calming experimental art. Having created street art since the age of 14, he combines his graffiti with various materials to integrate his artwork into the architecture of spaces.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“All places have power, and (Brown) has the power of students’ thinking,” Simek said. “The energy is different.” Monk added that she loves Simek’s work because “it’s so attentive to space.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomfield said there was some hesitancy about Simek painting on the staircase, so a compromise was reached with the idea of having him use black tape. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“How long will it stay there? I’m hoping for quite a long time,” Bloomfield said. “There’s no reason to think it can’t be permanent.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hidalgo noted that he felt a greater appreciation for his street art at Brown than at home. He hopes to inform students of the “the expropriation of land for the benefit of the state” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of Chile through his artwork.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For Simek, creating art is “a lifestyle,” he says. “It’s something that I do every day. I love the moment, I love what I am doing, I love the expression.”</span>

		<title>Seattle-based Sarah Galvin combines poetry, humor</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/16/seattle-based-sarah-galvin-combines-poetry-humor/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Critically acclaimed writer Sarah +Galvin turned her Thursday evening performance at McCormack Family Theater into a half-poetry reading, half-stand-up comedy show, pausing between every few pieces to ask a volunteer from the audience to share a joke. As part of the Literary Arts Department’s Writers on Writing Reading Series, Galvin read from both a collection that she is currently compiling and from her 2017 book “Ugly Time.” Throughout the reading and the question-and-answer, she emphasized the similarities between jokes and poems and added that they differ only in their endings: While jokes end with a “reductive gesture,” poems end with an “expansive gesture.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The humor of Galvin’s poetry demonstrates this parallel. Galvin read poems with titles like “Pastaphilia” and “My Grandpa Mailed Me a Piece of Pie Flattened Between Two Pieces of Wax Paper.” But the hilarity of Galvin’s poems does not detract from their potential to touch on serious issues in a powerful way. Xochi Cartland ’21 chose to introduce Galvin at the reading for LITR 1200: “Writers on Writing” because she loves Galvin’s unexpected turns from facetiousness to earnestness, she said. “There are some moments that are kind of after the absurdity that just say so much,” Cartland added. In her introduction, Cartland commented that “Galvin’s poems are both disturbing and delightful; there are very few people who can turn a doctor’s advice to flatten a line of ants with your ass into a poem about our mutual humanity.”</span></p>
<p class="p2">Assistant Professor of Literary Arts Sawako Nakayasu, who taught a section of the “Writers on Writing” class and invited Galvin to Brown, said she also appreciates Galvin’s unconventionality. Nakayasu met Galvin at a poetry reading where they both shared their work.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I just sat there in the audience and enjoyed her reading so much, enjoyed her person, and everything about it was very sparkly and exciting,” Nakayasu said. “So when I had this opportunity to invite a poet, she was one of the people that came to mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although Galvin’s work may be eccentric, she claims she is not a surrealist because “I’m just writing stuff that happened to me,” she said. Galvin draws much of her inspiration from conversations and dreams, but also finds ideas in more unorthodox places, such as poorly translated menus. Once Galvin has decided on the subject of a poem, she reads other writers’ work to find tools to help contextualize her thoughts, she said. She carries around five books, including “Letters to Wendy’s” by Joe Wenderoth and “The Difficult Farm” by Heather Christle, which she turns to for guidance when stuck. According to Galvin, these books have taught her that surrealism is not nonsense; it must abide by its own conventions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“What’s most important to me is creating an internal logic in a poem,” Galvin said. “The logic has to remain consistent and it has to have a purpose. … Nothing can be wasted.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Galvin has also learned about poetry through music, she said. The artist who served as “the real origin of (her) style” was Sexually Active Corpse, a one-man band who rapped nursery rhyme-like poems over beats made only with children’s instruments. “They were so surreal and dirty and weird, and I could just tell that he was only doing it for himself,” she said. “So that was what made me really want to write poetry.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Galvin herself started out in a band, writing lyrics and playing guitar throughout high school. After her guitar was stolen, she realized she could replace music with other tools. “The first big lesson I learned about poetry was that it’s composed of layers of meaning in the same way that a song is composed of different instruments,” Galvin said. “And if you’re just using words, you have to add something else to create that momentum; you don’t have a base, you don’t have a beat, … so the words have to do all that work.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Galvin has experimented with various ways of creating this type of momentum including structural and tonal manipulation of her writing so her poetry can move like music.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The content of Galvin’s poetry works with this rhythmic flow to shock and stir the reader. “The way I think a poem should make somebody feel is (like) when they’re a really little kid and they encounter an idea for the first time that’s crucial to being an adult, but they don’t know what it is,” Galvin said. She believes that everyday life becomes redundant and makes the world seem boring, but a childlike perspective can bring back the excitement, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think that the purpose of poetry and art in general is to restore people to that state where they can experience things with new highs,” Galvin said. “The human brain craves novelty, and I think art puts your everyday experience in a context where you can experience it anew again.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Providence Athenaeum, one of the East Side’s hidden gems, announced the reception of a large anonymous donation March 26 — marking a new era for the library’s special collections. The $100,000 gift, donated by a couple who have been loyal members of the Athenaeum for years, was directed at developing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the library’s special collections, which will give the Athenaeum the opportunity to acquire and conserve rare works.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re committed to the physical culture of the book,” said Matt Burriesci, the Athenaeum’s executive director.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“They saw a real need here for us to be able to acquire more things for the special permanent collection and also to have funds to restore some of the materials,” said Kate Wodehouse, director of collections and library services. The Athenaeum’s usual budget for special collections is small, with efforts targeted toward circulating materials, leaving few chances for acquisition and conservation. “I don’t know in our history that we’ve ever had anything this big directed especially toward the special collections,” Wodehouse said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We are very grateful to be part of this extraordinary Athenaeum community and its history,” the donors commented in a press release published by the Athenaeum.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The Athenaeum sits behind the University’s Rockefeller Library on the slope of College Hill but remains unexplored by many Providence residents and University students. The walls of the first floor and mezzanine contain some of the library’s 180,000 volumes on shelves that reach from floor to ceiling. Broken by the bookshelves into two levels of small alcoves, the library welcomes readers and studiers alike. The room that houses special collections, the Philbrick Rare Book Room, adjoins the library’s main Reading Room downstairs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The Athenaeum is a unique library and cultural center, and we welcome and enrich the educational and cultural pursuits of our members of the community. … We encourage a diverse public to engage in spirited conversation,” Burriesci said, noting the Athenaeum’s dedication to humanities pursuits and preserving its historic building.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The new fund allowed for the acquisition of three illustrated plates for one of the treasures of the special collection— the “Description de I’Égypte” — a 25-volume set of books commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte in the early 19th century, Wodehouse explained. The Athenaeum spent 10 years conserving the set, which was originally acquired in 1838 — only two years after the institution was founded. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re the only library in the state to have a complete set,” Wodehouse said. The set is housed in a custom-made Egyptian cabinet in the Rare Book Room.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(In) the mid-20th century, they noticed that there had been some plates that had been taken from (the library),” Wodehouse said. “They happened to be these 14 color bird prints from the natural history portion of the set.” Wodehouse found three of the plates for sale, featuring a total of 15 birds, and decided to purchase them to enhance the Athenaeum’s current collection. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Restoring the set to completion really adds a lot to the Athenaeum,” Burriesci said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The plate most prominently featured at the front of the exhibit depicts a Pharaoh eagle-owl. Athena, the patron goddess of the Athenaeum, is often symbolized by an owl, “so it felt like a real homecoming to have an owl plate, ready and available,” said Robin Wetherill, </span>the Athenaeum’s <span class="s1">director of marketing and communications.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, the plates are featured alongside “Observing Nature: Edna Lawrence and Cabinets of Curiosities,” the Athenaeum’s spring exhibition, which will be on display in the Philbrick Rare Book Room through June 17. The exhibition was put on in partnership with the Rhode Island School of Design’s Nature Lab in celebration of the Lab’s 80th anniversary, and it contains items from the Athenaeum’s collection as well as the lab’s.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We were so thrilled to have the acquisition fit so seamlessly with the exhibit that was already planned. With this exhibit, we’re highlighting the real treasures of our natural history collection, and these plates fit beautifully into that,” Wetherill said. “It’s been one of our most viewed exhibits already.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wodehouse plans to extend the power of the gift by waiting to spend its entirety. “I don’t want to rush into any big decisions, acquire anything too quickly,” she said. “It gives me time to be very thoughtful about it.” She plans to consider what would align well with the current collection, future exhibits and “the narrative of the Athenaeum and the people that have connected with it over the years,” Wodehouse said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“People think we’re a part of Brown or a part of RISD or think we’re a part of the courthouse and don’t really know that they can come in. So we’re trying to get members of the public in and excited about it,” Wetherill said. “When people walk in the door, they’re just amazed that this treasure exists and that they’d never really known about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Athenaeum will be hosting a Garden Party and Open House May 20, during which the Athenaeum’s Richmond Fountain — which has been turned off for more than a decade — will once again flow. The newly acquired plates will be on display during the open house.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Surrounded by confused students, Nigerian artist Jelili Atiku processed across the Main Green yesterday afternoon dressed as a ram with several red-tagged students crawling behind him. Attention piqued, students continued to watch with curiosity.</p>
<p class="p4">Atiku was awarded the Artist Protection Fund Fellowship in 2018, granted by the Institute of International Education. At the University, Atiku serves as visiting assistant professor of Africana Studies and works with the Brown Arts Initiative. Atiku “strives to help viewers understand the world and expand their experiences so they can activate and renew their lives and environments,” said Butch Rovan, director of the BAI, in the introduction to Atiku’s talk yesterday following the performance.</p>
<p class="p4">As part of his latest performance, Atiku assembled four students to resemble a herd of sheep crawling behind him. Dressed in a suit, carrying a scepter and wearing a ram mask, he led the herd to the American flag located on the Main Green. The students stood up and recited the U.S. national anthem in a monotone voice and then had their red tags removed by the masked artist. Atiku continued to walk across campus, making his way through the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle, walking along Thayer Street and finishing his performance in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts.</p>
<p class="p4">“The performance is actually talking about the attitude of the president, Trump,” Atiku told The Herald, commenting on the psychological control he feels the president wields over the American people. At one point in the performance, Atiku sat on a bench next to an unexpecting student, who rose and left after a few moments of bewilderment. Atiku spread his legs, employing dominant body language to illustrate the scale of Trump’s power and control, he explained in the talk.</p>
<p class="p4">Since 2015, the APF Fellowship has awarded residencies to threatened artists, said Alison Russo, executive director of the APF. “Artists come to us and we create, design and develop innovative residency programs like the one here at Brown.” The residency is intended to offer artists a way to “develop their practice, build foundations, relationships and hopefully advance, not only their careers, but their personal lives,” Russo added.</p>
<p class="p4">“When I was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACa-4fFLxxc">arrested</a> in my country, after I did my performance, I felt the need to be safe,” Atiku told The Herald. “I was talking about domestic terrorism in my community. The king got offended by that. … I got arrested, as well as other five people along with me.”</p>
<p class="p4">“For Jelili, the quality of his work is evident as a performance artist,” Russo said. “So the selection committee unanimously awarded him.”</p>
<p class="p4">In his talk, Atiku discussed the performance and his artistic and political background in conversation with Dotun Ayobade, a postdoctoral research associate and Mellon Gateway Fellow in the Department of Africana Studies.</p>
<p class="p4">Atiku explained the purpose behind some of the elements of the performance. “I think what is interesting is that no part of your body showed,” Ayobade said, referencing the ram mask Atiku donned and the red-tag covered suit. “It’s hard for people to know that this is an African, or this is a black body making this critique.”</p>
<p class="p4">“The first thing I try to do is to deconstruct my body in my performance, … and that makes me a symbol of humanity who doesn’t have any color,” Atiku said. “He’s neither black nor green, just human. And that’s what I want to do.”</p>
<p class="p4">Atiku also discussed some of his previous pieces. One project performed in Nigeria, in collaboration with a local theater group, involved being tied with ropes and dragged across the ground as if he were a ram. Ayobade described this as an example of one of Atiku’s focuses in his work: using his body and the trauma inflicted upon it “almost like carrying sacrifice on behalf of the collective” in order to get his message across. The tension of the ropes injured his throat, and the participants who pulled the ropes ended the performance in tears.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though less visceral than some of his past work, yesterday’s performance also relied on the power of bodies. The piece was originally meant to involve 50 students — to represent the 50 states — who would follow Atiku in his procession around campus. The plan had to be changed when only three of the 15 students who signed up arrived to participate — and one joined as the performance was beginning. “There is this space for fluidity,” Atiku said. “I use the situation, I use the audience, I use the circumstances around me” to create the final performance, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4">As for his time at Brown, Atiku described his experience as “wonderful” and expressed his admiration for the students’ attitudes. “Brown has this uniqueness of being peaceful, and the students are highly inclusive, and that’s so deep,” Atiku told The Herald.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bo Burnham’s debut digitizes adolescent loneliness</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">There is not a single memorable line in all of “Eighth Grade,” Bo Burnham’s divinely excruciating feature film debut, which screened at the Ivy Film Festival Sunday night. But that is part of its magic. “Eighth Grade” is a film with a keen sense of the way people communicate. No one speaks in glittering, Gerwigian lines here; it is all banal tweenspeak. Burnham’s writing and directing triumphs by making this riveting, as characters fumble to say what they mean while uneasy tensions build around them, with whole scenes balancing on the cusp of a relentless live-wire awkwardness that will make you wish you could be subsumed by the seat you are sitting in. It is as miserable as it is spellbinding.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The film focuses on eighth-grader Kayla (Elsie Fisher) as she nears the end of her time in middle school. She lives with her father, Mark (Josh Hamilton), and likes making advice videos for her YouTube channel, where she delivers earnest lectures on topics such as self-confidence and making friends. In real life, though, she struggles with these rites of passage as much as anyone. She does not have any close friends and wins the dreaded “quietest student” superlative at school. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of Kayla’s videos — on “being yourself” — opens the film. In it, she insists that she is not actually a quiet person; she just does not feel compelled to talk all the time. It is an obvious front for her own timidity, which is a key part of what Burnham explores. From the makeup she puts on before her “just woke up!” selfie to the uncomfortable cool she affects for the rare conversation with classmates, Burnham attends to the ways — both modern and timeless — in which Kayla constructs a public image. Behind it all, we see her dull reality, as she lies in bed and scrolls through Instagram for hours, intoxicated by images of other lives. It is an almost unbearably acute portrait of what loneliness and anxiety look like in a world where a frenetic, jam-packed Twitter feed is always just a touch away.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That said, much of “Eighth Grade” makes for delicious cringe comedy. Kayla’s interactions with her classroom crush, an airheaded and very pubescent boy named Riley (Daniel Zolghadri), are squirm-inducing and hilarious in equal measure. So too are the sexual investigations she pursues in hopes of learning something that will impress him; a banana may or may not be involved.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Her relationship with her father also starts as a source of prickly humor, though it morphs into something more poignant. Mark loves his daughter, but has trouble getting through to her, and Kayla shuts him down every time he tries. Hamilton acts the role beautifully; the barely concealed joy that wells up within him whenever Kayla seems as if she has found a friend is infectious and quietly moving. Mark just wants his daughter to be happy. Is there anything more pure?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Probably not, but “Eighth Grade” leaves room for a few more affecting relationships before its bittersweet conclusion. When Kayla goes to shadow a high school student in preparation for the next school year, she is assigned Olivia (Emily Robinson), a high school senior who approaches her with open-armed compassion. Olivia doesn’t know Kayla as the quiet kid with no friends — she just sees a girl who knows how to rock pink shortalls. For a day, that is who Kayla becomes. She is still a little nervous, but more than that, she is happy to be with people.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A little later, Kayla gives Olivia a call. She is hesitant to do so, thinking Olivia may have merely felt obliged to give out her number, but when Olivia picks up, she is as open and loveable as ever. As Kayla stammers out her feelings of loneliness, she starts pacing back and forth across her bedroom, and the camera follows her with breathless intensity. There is a giddiness that comes with letting someone in, and Burnham lets the image feel it as much as Kayla does.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">His visual style throughout is similarly emphatic, full of decisive cuts, loud needle drops and the occasional slow-motion shot. Burnham may have started with little more than a webcam, but with “Eighth Grade” he becomes a filmmaker, full stop. Also coming into her own is Fisher as Kayla. It is not easy to make loneliness interesting on screen, but Fisher does it with humor and unaffected intimacy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not everything in the film works. As the film nears its conclusion, Burnham starts to let up on the fiercely managed inarticulateness of his characters, and tries to give them cathartic monologues that do not ring entirely true. And, for a brief stretch, the film starts to feel nearly gratuitous in its awkwardness. But so does life, sometimes. That is Burnham’s trump card, and in “Eighth Grade,” he plays it perfectly, digging into discomfort until he strikes something deeply human. It is too real — which is to say, of course, that it is exactly right.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Tuesday, the literary arts department kicked off International Fiction Now, a three-day festival of readings and performances honoring the novelist and former Professor Emeritus of Literary Arts Robert Coover, who taught at Brown for 33 years and is widely renowned as a trailblazer in experimental metafiction. Affectionately known as “Bob Fest,” the festival began with a number of voice performances of Coover’s work, followed by a series of readings by Coover’s colleagues and former students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The festival programming yesterday featured a showcase in the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment of experiments by current and former Brown students in the digital language arts, several presentations on electronic writing and digital language art as well as readings by Russell Banks, Ru Freeman, William Kennedy, Marlon James, Ben Marcus and T.C. Boyle.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Today’s programming will include a panel discussion called “Postmodernism: What Was It? What’s Next?” and readings by distinguished authors, including Don DeLillo, Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For an avid consumer of contemporary literary fiction, Bob Fest’s lineup is nothing short of spectacular. Funded by the the Brown Arts Initiative and the Office of the Provost, the festival celebrates Coover and the publication of his first novel, “The Origin of the Brunists.” Since Coover famously inaugurated the electronic writing and digital writing programs at Brown, the festival also serves to highlight Coover’s encouragement of the coalition of technology and literature, as well as mark the relaunch of the International Writers Project, a program that Coover started in the 1989. The fellowship “provides institutional, intellectual, artistic and social support to writers who face personal danger and threats to their livelihood in nations throughout the world,” according to the University’s website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A handful of Coover’s former students, now established writers, read from their own work on Tuesday. Many of them prefaced their performances with affectionate words (and sometimes, affectionate poems) for Coover, expressing gratitude for his mentorship. Robert Arellano ’91 MFA ’94, author of the kaleidoscopic hypertext novel “Sunshine ’69,” composed a Homeric ode to Coover, addressing him as “Bobocles.” Shelley Jackson MFA ’94, an electronic literature proponent, said, “I’m writing (in my next book) about how the words of others haunt our mouths. Bob, your words will always haunt mine.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m really surprised and happy about the diversity of the readings,” said Daniella Balarezo ’18, adding that she was “touched by the sense of community and family in the environment.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s all goodwill about Bob. He traveled in international writing circles for a long time. All I had to do was say, ‘We’re going to have a big blowout festival for Bob,’ and pretty much everyone said ‘yes,’” Professor of Literary Arts Rick Moody ’83 told The Herald. While Coover has been retired for many years, he still keeps an office in the Literary Arts Building, which he frequents: “It’s a well-known, open secret that Bob basically practices vampire hours. Frequently he’ll show up at the office around 5 or 6 p.m. and work till 3 or 4 in the morning.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Coover’s literary career has by no means tapered off. He continues to publish humorous, self-reflective novels that comment on fiction’s traditions. In 2017, he published “Huck Out West,” where he imagines Huckleberry Finn’s continued adventures after “lighting out” to the West.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Aerialists perform spring show</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In a display of strength, flexibility, precision and courage, Brown Aerial Arts Society members performed for a packed Alumnae Hall Friday and Saturday nights. The aerialists captivated their audience while suspended from silks, the trapeze, the lyra and each other in “Acromancy,” the Aerial Arts Society’s Spring Showcase. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The performance opened with a group number to the title track of the recent movie musical “The Greatest Showman.” While three performers hung from the trapeze, lyra and silks, the rest of the group members performed acrobatics around them. The Showman’s hat continued as a prop woven into the choreography of many of the routines throughout the rest of the showcase. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Starting with a group number is not something that we always do,” said Anna Bjella ’18, technical director of this year’s Aerial Arts Society. “There were three of us involved in choreographing it, so it had dance bits, apparatus bits and … acro bits.” She added that she felt the opening was strong, “which helps build, if not a storyline, at least a feeling of continuity throughout the show.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Following the initial group introduction, the show was broken into two acts, composed of 15 partner and individual performances. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At one point during the first act, Adam Moreno ’18 performed on a pole while blindfolded to Halsey’s “Eyes Closed.” Later, Katherine Magee ’18 and Jake Heinlein ’18, in their piece dubbed “Dueling Wizards,” danced to “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” by Paul Dukas using a trapeze and silks in tandem, with the “wand” strokes of one performer influencing the movements of the other. In the second act, Larissa Gusek, a Rhode Island School of Design student, performed with Moreno to Aqua’s “Barbie Girl,” driving a miniature pink car onto the stage to supplement their acrobatic performance. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The audience revelled in each of the group’s acts, applauding constantly and cheering in surprise as each performer posed, climbed and danced. Many attended to support friends, while others said they came simply to see a performance unlike anything else on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Putting the show together was a challenge for the group, which faced problems when trying to secure practice and performance space — especially difficult for aerial arts, as it involves rigged equipment and safety precautions, Bjella said. “We hadn’t been in the apparatuses since early December,” she added. As technical director, she was in charge of deciding whether it was safe enough to perform. It wasn’t until the day Bjella had decided to make the call that the pulleys used to support the apparatuses were put up, she said. Kathryn Samp ’18, co-director of the Aerial Arts Society, added that the group started preparing for the performance two months ago, but due to these logistical conflicts, they were only able to get on the apparatuses and begin choreographing routines three weeks ago. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“I basically visualized my whole routine and then hoped that, when I was able to get on, … it would work out,” said Yael Braverman ’20, who performed on the trapeze at the beginning of the second act. She spent a lot of time watching “YouTube videos over spring break and then like two weeks of practicing,” she said. Braverman had previously done trapeze when she was much younger and hopes to learn other acts moving forward. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Co-directors Samp and Jana Butman ’18 emphasized that this year’s performance, while faced with roadblocks, was also a success. “This year, we were able to strike a good balance between the spontaneity and individuality of our club, as well as organization and preparation to get our show together,” Samp said. The group does not have formal practices or coaches, she explained. “It’s very self-directed, very individually motivated. You train as much as you want to get the results you want,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“All of the routines this year were so phenomenal, we didn’t have to coach people’s acts,” Butman said, underscoring the group’s strength and independence. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Butman performed on the lyra — an aerial hoop suspended at the center of the stage — in the third-to-last act of the show, followed by Samp’s performance in the hammock, a single silk suspended in a loop. Butman and Samp portrayed contrasting characters in their performances: Butman’s evil sorceress countered Samp’s good witch. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Samp, Butman, Bjella and 10 other senior members will graduate at the end of this semester, making this their final performance with the group. “A lot of the community that I’ve found at Brown is through aerial,” Bjella said. While Samp and Butman agree that next year will be used to rebuild the organization, “with the amount of turnout this show has gotten, I’m confident that a lot of people are going to be very motivated to join next year,” Butman said. “We support people coming in who have absolutely no experience, no strength. … We think it will be pretty easy to build up our club again after all the students graduate,” Samp added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The show marked a moment of transition. “I started crying in the middle of the final trapeze act,” Butman said, reflecting after her final performance with the group.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Spring Weekend promises rich array of artists</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students have waited eagerly for 2018’s installment of Spring Weekend since the Brown Concert Agency held its annual Spring Weekend lineup release party at Stout Irish Sports Pub March 20. This year’s Spring Weekend will take place April 27 and 28 and feature a rich array of artists.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the two-day concert aims to “distort the norm” and “disrupt hierarchies” according to the release video, its lineup boasts six outstanding acts that do exactly that — transcend genre boundaries and redefine cultural norms through their defiant soundscapes and personas. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When booking artists, we try to think about performances that we think are going to be really good live,” said Michael Mills ’20, a board member of BCA. “We always focus on diversity and trying to bring in a broad range of musical styles and people from different backgrounds.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday’s headliner is British singer-songwriter NAO, a solo artist adored for her distinctive pop-funk style that fuses playful electronic beats with soulful R&amp;B-style lyrics. Her debut album, “For All We Know,” released in 2016, saw her nominated for Best British Female Solo Artist.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NAO will be preceded by Rico Nasty — also known as “Tacobella” — who is most famous for her eclectic, TV-inspired singles “iCarly” and “Hey Arnold,” both released in 2016. The Maryland rapper’s latest album, “Sugar Trap 2,” is jazzy and quite decidedly trap, characterized by synth lines, heavy back beats and autotuned raps. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Also performing on Friday is Virginia-based rapper and producer DRAM (stands for Does Real Ass Music), who is best known for his playful hit single “Broccoli,” featuring Lil Yachty, which was just one of many gems on his debut LP, “Big Baby DRAM,” released in 2016. In a review for the breakthrough LP, Pitchfork drew comparisons between DRAM’s music and a “big bubblebath,” while also underscoring his charismatic “camp counselor” qualities. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The artist that has received the most buzz post-reveal is Saturday’s headliner, Anderson .Paak, a California-based singer, rapper and producer whose jazzy, sensual anthems — including “Lyk Dis” and “Heart Don’t Stand a Chance” ­— have been energizing the playlists of student parties since their release on his dual set of 2016 albums “Yes Lawd!” and “Malibu,” respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NAO and .Paak “were two people that we wanted to book this year from the start and we were really happy to book. They have this sound that’s really, really popular right now,” Mills said. “For people who like more than one genre, they are cross-genre performers.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">.Paak’s performance will be preceded by a set by Japanese singer-songwriter Rina Sawayama. Known for her glittery, soul-infused digi-pop songs like “Cyber Stockholm Syndrome,” Sawayama has been acclaimed by The Guardian for her singular capacity for synthesizing her influences into something “bracing and modern.” Her recently released eponymous album, “Rina,” includes Spice Girls-reminscent tracks like “Ordinary Superstar” and “Take Me As I Am.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following Sawayama’s set is Chicago-based indie-rock band Whitney — which will provide an exciting contrast to the concert’s primarily pop and hip-hop vibe. The project of songwriters Julien Ehrlich and Max Kakacek, Whitney’s music blends Bon Iver’s lyrical austerity and the vintage, twangy romance of The Alabama Shakes and The Walters. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Providence’s beloved 18-member brass band and Spring Weekend staple What Cheer? Brigade will also perform a set on Saturday.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Headstone brings recognition to Sissieretta Jones, pioneering black opera singer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though black opera singer and Providence native Sissieretta Jones was the highest paid black performer of her time, she passed away in relative obscurity 85 years ago, leaving an unmarked grave. This weekend, bookstore Stages of Freedom will change that. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a series of seven free events — including a play, a tour and a concert that will culminate in the Saturday unveiling of her new headstone — Stages of Freedom will celebrate the 150th anniversary of Jones’ birth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones was a pioneer as the first black woman to perform for four U.S. presidents and at Carnegie Hall. Despite her influential legacy, Jones receives little recognition today.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Jones) grew up on College Hill and retired to College Hill, and we really want to make her a household name in Providence,” said Ray Rickman, executive director of </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/28/stages-of-freedom-sells-books-saves-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stages of Freedom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit on Westminster Street that sells books to finance swimming lessons for children of color and promotes black culture and history in the Providence community. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The three-day celebration kicked off on Thursday with an exhibit opening and one-woman play. Friday will bring a gallery tea and talk, reminiscent of the tea parties Jones would host for little girls at her house, as well as keynote addresses by Maureen Lee, a Jones biographer, and Gino Francesconi, director of the Archives and Rose Museum at Carnegie Hall. Finally, on Saturday morning, Stages of Freedom will host a walking tour, concert and ceremony for the headstone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The event series — the largest ever hosted by Stages of Freedom — was funded with over $45,000 from an anonymous donor, several foundations and 135 GoFundMe donors who helped pay for the $8,000 headstone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rickman hopes the celebration will bring well-deserved recognition to a woman who influenced the world not only through her music, but also through her courageous civil rights activism during her career at the turn of the 20th century.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before her, if (an entertainer) performed for white people, it would be in a space where only white people could come,” Rickman explained. “She refused to perform if black people couldn’t come.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the challenges she experienced as a woman of color facing blatant racism, “she never let that stop her,” Lee said. “We can learn from her that if you have a passion and a desire that is so strong — with her it was her singing, she just had this amazing voice — you can overcome a lot of things if you keep pushing forward and trying to achieve what is most important to you.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just because she has been forgotten doesn’t diminish the fact that she was an important figure,” Francesconi said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee also noted that “it's important to go back and look at the achievements of people in the past that have been overlooked and to recognize how they were pioneers and led the way for future vocalist singers and entertainers.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rickman is ready for that time of acknowledgement to be now. “She’s been in the grave 85 years without a gravestone,” he said. “We’re finally going to fix that on June 9.”</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Cable Car closes after 42 years</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/07/28/cable-car-closes-42-years/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">After 42 years of featuring films in a uniquely intimate setting, Cable Car Cinema and Cafe shut the doors of its 204 South Main St. location May 27, the owners announced in a Facebook post April 26. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The closure comes at the tail end of negotiations with the Rhode Island School of Design, which owns the building, wrote owners Daniel Kamil and Emily Steffian in the Facebook post. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cable Car occupied the space through a 10-year lease that ends in September 2018, according to a statement from RISD. On April 16, after unsuccessful lease renewal discussions, the owners notified RISD that they would not be seeking a new lease.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We did not come to this decision lightly,” the owners wrote. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, RISD wrote that it was “saddened” by Cable Car’s decision. The school had been in talks with the owners to explore a number of options that would allow Cable Car remain in that location, such as adding second floor or alternating usage of the space, but ultimately could not agree, Silva </span><a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180427/providences-cable-car-cinema-to-close-after-42-years"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the Providence Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The school offered Cable Car a renewal at a lowered rent, but the owners still refused the offer, RISD wrote, adding that the owners told them their decision to close was “not based on finances.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamil and Steffian responded with another Facebook post asserting that Cable Car was “never formally offered any rent reduction by RISD.” The post also claimed that the theater had made three requests to purchase its Main Street building from RISD, even suggesting in May of 2017 that Cable Car be run as a nonprofit going forward. But none of these requests were accepted, the post stated. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Danielle Mancuso, senior public relations specialist at RISD, did not respond to a request for comment about RISD’s statement.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The theater’s closing was met with nostalgia and dismay from community members.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Brown students know Cable Car as the host of the annual French Film Festival. Sylvie Toux, resident director of the Brown in Paris program and one of the founders of the festival, was sad to learn of Cable Car’s closing. Toux previously lived on Benefit Street, just down the road from Cable Car. A true regular, she would visit the theater twice a week to watch a film, she said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The theater stood out to Toux due to its atmosphere — the same one that had caught the attention of patrons for decades. Audience members sat on couches rather than traditional theater seats. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When Toux started the Providence French Film Festival, she chose Cable Car over other possible venues, such as the Avon Cinema, because the kinds of movies that Cable Car showed were similar to those she wished to feature in the festival, making it the perfect choice, she said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The closing) was very upsetting,” said Lewis Seifert, a professor of French studies who served as head of the department from 2011 through 2017. Cable Car had an “excellent” relationship with the department, Seifert added. As a result of the change, he is concerned about the future of the French Film Festival — even when it does find a new home, the program will probably be shorter and include fewer films, he said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the owners had access to a vast, esoteric filmography, Cable Car made it possible to bring lesser-known titles to the public eye, Seifert said. This may become more difficult now after Cable Car’s closing, which is “a loss for the entire community,” he added. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Blakely, research associate in French Studies and current director of the French Film Festival, noted that Cable Car was always enthusiastic about hosting and accommodating the festival. The event has drawn Brown students and members of the community every year, overflowing the theater, he said. The festival’s upcoming 22nd year will be the first time Cable Car does not host the event, he said. The next location remains uncertain, but the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts and the Avon are possibilities, he added.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the theater officially shut its doors at 204 South Main St. after showing the movie RBG, Cable Car has since hosted a number of screenings at different locations around Providence, such as “The Gospel According to Andre” at the Columbus Theatre. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The owners have not written off the possibility of reopening the “theater with couches” in the future, they wrote. “For the short-term, we will catch our breath, take a moment, and if the right opportunity arises — the Cable Car Cinema may emerge in another locale and in another form,” they wrote, ending their letter by noting that the closing was not a goodbye, but rather a “blackout.”</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> “The Bookshop,” a film adaption of Penelope Fitzgerald’s original novel, echoes the leisurely pace of the book itself. The film’s plodding nature allows for a fully developed storyline, but struggles to retain the viewer’s attention through the duration of the movie. At times, the plot wanders and the film drags, and even borders on soporific; however, the crawling pace of the film is at times an asset, and gives prominence to the scenery and characters’ emotions. Near the conclusion, everything seems to speed up with a series of events that releases bottled-up emotions, giving weight to characters’ actions. “The Bookshop” is a movie about selfishness and to what degree each character will relinquish their selfish inclinations. It is not a film driven by plot, but by characters. The little that happens is largely inconsequential and often dull, but the relationships developed between characters lend the film a touching sincerity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Set in eastern England in 1959, the film follows Florence Green, a lonely middle-aged widow looking to open a bookshop in the sleepy coastal town of Hardborough, England. As she establishes her store in the so-called Old House, a decaying stone building, she prompts the mannerly ire of the wealthy and influential Violet Gamart. Violet had planned to remake the Old House into an arts center, and much of the story is dictated by her aspirations, although she commands a surprisingly small amount of screen time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although some in Hardborough dismiss or reject the idea of a bookshop, Florence finds a kindred spirit in Mr. Brundish, a reclusive old widower who has ostensibly lost faith in humanity and rarely leaves his mansion, and prefers to spend his time reading. After Florence’s business finds modest success, she is introduced to Vladimir Nabokov’s scandalous and recently published “Lolita.” Tension in the town builds as she orders 250 copies for the store, but as is the case with most of the film, the consequences fall flat, and serve mostly to illustrate the growing intimacy between Florence and Mr. Brundish.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another of Florence’s supporters is the reluctantly sympathetic Christine, a young and opinionated girl working as an assistant in the shop. At their first meeting, Christine informs Florence that life passes slowly for women without children, a potentially sore point for the childless Florence. The subsequent growth of their relationship is one of the most heartfelt pieces of “The Bookshop.” Although the movie comes off as purposefully nostalgic and bookish, it is neither overly sentimental nor sickeningly sweet. Reality is expressed through awkward interactions and repressed emotions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The small village of Hardborough is steeped in the subdued grays and blues of the northern English coast, and the camera frequently pans over thistles or wildflowers blowing in the wind by the sea, adding to the movie’s bookish feel. Although the visuals are appealing, an abundance of silences is one of the greatest successes of the film. The majority of the action occurs in soft tones or without words altogether, though sometimes the background music becomes unnecessarily loud and overpowering and takes away from the potency of the silence. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Providence Public Library undertakes renovations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Beginning next week, the Providence Public Library will launch a $25 million renovation intended to transform its 84,000 square foot Empire Street building into a modern, capacious facility capable of housing the library’s vast number of unique collections and education programs. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The PPL has big plans for its new renovation, which is due to be completed in the spring of 2020. The library was last renovated in 1987, rendering it “very much due for an upgrade,” according to Jack Martin, executive director of PPL. It was designed in 1953, when libraries primarily served as book repositories. The PPL needs a building that can house its educational programs and workforce development initiatives which teach community members literacy, coding, data navigation and other marketable skills, explained PPL marketing and communications director Tonia Mason. Presently, it lacks the proper resources and facilities. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Through grants procured from the state of Rhode Island, money raised from the capital campaign “Think Again” and a generous donation of $1 million from philanthropist Rosalyn Sinclair, the PPL plans to re-work old spaces and create new ones. The library intends to install glass walls, six basketball court-sized floors of materials and a 3,000-foot education lab on the ground floor, all of which will be visible “right when (patrons) walk in,” Martin said. The library will also see the additions of a children’s room, a teen space and new study areas for college students, as well as a museum-quality exhibition space and a “Special Collections Suite” for researchers and the general public.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The renovations will encompass increased accessibility measures, which will serve to “adapt the (library) to the needs of 21st-century patrons,” according to an article published in the Providence Journal about the renovations.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(The library) will no longer be an imposing gray monster on Empire Street,” Martin said. “Its limestone will be gleaming.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Martin, the library serves around 160,000 patrons annually from all over the state of Rhode Island. It houses the Statewide Reference Resource Center — an electronic resource database that every person in Rhode Island has access to with a library card. It has collections on a vast number of topics, from whaling to the Civil War to the history of typography, and it recently acquired the AS220 collection, focused on the history of AS220 as a Providence-based arts organization, which is “very funky and cool” according to Martin. The library is perhaps most proud of its 90-year catalog of the Providence Journal, which spans from 1900 to 1990 and is searchable by subject.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Last week, PPL hosted an online auction of the furnishings from the old building, which raked in just over $14,000 — all of which will go toward the renovation. Among the items auctioned off were mini chandeliers, magazine stands and a whole room of oscillating fans.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Sure, one oscillating fan isn’t very cool,” said Martin. “But a room of them is very neat.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Mason, the most popular items were the old card catalogs, which each fetched a few hundred dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Rhode Islanders have a real nostalgia for the PPL,” Martin said. “We have stories of people whose parents proposed here. People want to own a piece of the history.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the renovations are underway, the library will be temporarily relocated to a smaller space termed the Rhode Island Room, which is accessible through the library’s Washington Street entrance. There will be computers, workspaces and a boutique selection of books specially curated by the library’s staff. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re going to have an awesome place at the heart of the city that will have all the facilities and capabilities to provide the types of services that we’ve been providing,” Mason said. “We’ll be able to have more of them, and more opportunities for people to come in and access our collections.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I can’t wait to stand at the bottom of the Grand Staircase and welcome everybody,” Martin said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This summer, the Providence Public Library opened the archives of AS220, a Providence-based community arts non-profit, to the public. This release concludes a two-year effort by the library and AS220 to house and preserve the organization’s archives. According to the press release, the archives include over 110 linear feet of records and 700 gigabytes of digital files that represent the organization’s lifespan.</p>
<p class="p2">AS220, founded in 1985, works “to provide an unjuried and uncensored forum for any Rhode Island artist working in just about any medium imaginable,” said David Dvorchak, communications director for AS220. The organization provides gallery spaces and performance venues that are open to all artists producing original work, he said. AS220 owns three buildings in downtown Providence, which accommodate the gallery spaces as well as private housing for artists and a restaurant. The nonprofit also offers a youth program geared toward young adults ages 14 to 21 in the custody or care of the state of Rhode Island, Dvorchak explained. Put simply, “it is a multifaceted organization that tries to provide support for artists in Rhode Island,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Following previous requests for the use of AS220’s materials, an archival effort began about two years ago, said Kate Wells, curator of the Rhode Island Collections at Providence Public Library. AS220 sought a “permanent home for their archives,” which they found across the street at the PPL.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve been trying to build collections … since the library’s beginning, and this collection fits in with a lot of what we have,” said Jordon Goffin, head curator of collections at the library. This is a new type of collection for the PPL, as the library has not housed many large archival collections in the past, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The library acquired a federal grant from the National Historical Preservation and Records Commission to hire a project archivist, Janaya Kizzie. Kizzie has worked with the collection for over a year to both determine the “high-level philosophical” organization of the collection — as it must be usable by potential researchers — and work out the smaller details, such as removing paper clips and rusted staples. “You can’t have a collection that is a complete mess in an intellectual sense, and you also can’t have a collection that’s covered in things that are slowly destroying it,” she said. Otherwise, “you won’t have a collection at all.”</p>
<p class="p2">The archives are meant to appeal to people with varying goals, just as AS220 supports individuals in “creating art, … viewing art or appreciating art,” Dvorchak said.</p>
<p class="p2">Wells said that people are already utilizing the collection for “a lot of creative works that would be serving as an inspiration point for new artwork.” The archive is also being used by those “interested in the social justice aspect of AS220,” she added. This includes organizations hoping to provide access to underserved communities’ perspectives, she said.</p>
<p class="p2">“AS220 is more than an arts organization — they built a community from the ground up and they did it in a way that very few other organizations could,” Kizzie said.</p>
<p class="p2">One popular element of the collection is the posters, documenting events spanning the 33 years of AS220’s existence. This collection not only chronicles the “great artists who have been in Providence and are in Providence right now,” Kizzie said, but also recalls the designs that at once, “seem so ubiquitous, but then all of sudden, they’re gone.” The archive also includes episodes of AS220’s cable access show, TV220, which ran for 15 years and showcased the breadth of AS220’s work in that period, Wells said.</p>
<p class="p2">The growth of AS220, as illustrated by the collection, coincides with the revitalization of downtown Providence. “When we were first founded back in 1985, Providence was not the most welcoming or supportive place for artists,” Dvorchak said, noting that people who studied urban art often looked to bigger cities — such as New York and Los Angeles — for opportunities. AS220’s efforts to make creating and viewing art accessible allowed them “to open up those opportunities for the community here in Rhode Island,” Dvorchak added. AS220’s history is a “core component of what makes Providence a really creative city,” Wells said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">“Journeys in Visual Storytelling” has arrived at the Rhode Island School of Design Illustration Studies Building Gallery just in time to remind students of their halcyon days of childhood. The exhibition, which will run through Oct. 7, highlights the works of children’s literature written and illustrated by three-time Caldecott Medal winner and RISD alum David Wiesner, celebrating the artistic merit of his stories.</p>
<p class="p4">The exhibition features two of Wiesner’s books, “Art &amp; Max” and “Mr. Wuffles”, and includes page displays and Wiesner’s preliminary sketches, covers, models and dummy books.</p>
<p class="p4">The “Art &amp; Max” exhibit is about two lizards who paint together, and throughout the events of the story, one of the characters draws over the other. Because of this, one character takes on many textures, composed of different artistic mediums such as watercolor, pastel and ink. Wiesner, who took over two years to create this book, attributes his inspiration to “a desire to work with different media,” Wiesner said.</p>
<p class="p4">“As I began to pull out different types of paints and materials, I started playing with them to recall their feel,” Wiesner said, and described how he used various media to draw roguish characters.</p>
<p class="p4">“Mr. Wuffles” is set from a cat’s point of view. While the cat plays with a toy spaceship, aliens that live in the spaceship befriend insects to try to defeat the cat. After shelving the work for eight years, suddenly “everything clicked.” Soon after, Mr. Wuffles was finished. Susan Doyle, head of RISD’s illustration department, noted the contrast in color palettes between the cat’s home and the aliens’ spaceship and pointed out the apparent thoughtfulness that characterizes Wiesner’s work.</p>
<p class="p4">Wiesner’s work has “an element of fantasy but (is) drawn very realistically,” Doyle said, also noting Wiesner’s attention to detail and imagination.</p>
<p class="p4">The exhibition also features an iPad displaying Spot, an iOS application created by Wiesner. The storybook application serves as a visual adventure experience in which, by pinching and zooming, viewers may move to different worlds.</p>
<p class="p4">“Spot goes back to my time at RISD when I played around with the idea of worlds within worlds,” Wiesner said. Wiesner tried for years to use that concept in a book, but when he first saw the pinch and zoom feature of an iPad, he realized that “this would be the perfect way for (viewers) to explore connected worlds.” For each transition, Wiesner had to create around a dozen large paintings.</p>
<p class="p4">Wiesner, who holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in illustration, recalled RISD as a school that he was “waiting for his whole life to go to.” Not only did he enjoy the school, but he was inspired by the architecture of the surrounding city. “When I draw neighborhoods, I tend to make them look like Providence,” Wiesner said.</p>
<p class="p4">Eileen Holland RISD ’19, a student who helped set up the exhibition, found that Weisner’s process of developing the final narrative and the compositions of his illustrations were the most fascinating aspects of the exhibition. “From the initial rough sketches to compositional studies on tracing paper, color studies and even clay models of the characters, there is a great deal of planning and experimenting that was necessary to create the finished product,” Holland said.</p>
<p class="p4">Jacqueline Lee RISD ’20 similarly noted that the exhibition reveals the art of creating works themselves. “My favorite part of the exhibition is the effort David puts in the planning phase of the artwork,” Lee said. “Being able to see all of the incarnations of one page or all of the ‘dummy’ versions of a story puts into perspective the work it takes to make a narrative.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">After half a decade of waiting, fans of former Beatles star Paul McCartney can finally revel in his new solo album “Egypt Station.” Released Sept. 7, this collection of 14 tracks — and two instrumental bookends — marks the 16th album of McCartney’s largely underwhelming solo career. While “Egypt Station” might not signal a ‘break’ for McCartney’s solo efforts, it certainly has more potential than its predecessors and is likely to be a milestone of the singer-songwriter’s late solo career. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Egypt Station” is unique in its travelogue vibe. The album “starts off at the station on the first song, and then each song is like a different station,” McCartney wrote in a statement published by producing company Capitol Records. “I think of it as a dream location that the music emanates from,” he wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The album features an eclectic melange of tracks, charged with a whole spectrum of emotions in which existentialism and profound contemplations morph into lust and light-hearted, crude humor. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">One of the first tracks “Egypt Station” greets the listener with “I don’t know,” one of the two singles McCartney released ahead of the album. The unmistakably McCartney-esque piano ballad is infused with a amalgam of angst, frustration and self-doubt accompanied by carefully scattered dashes of fatalism and reassurance. “I don’t think I can take it any more,” McCartney croons, in this raw confession of human emotion. “Where am I going wrong? I don’t know. … What’s the matter with me?” he sings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His contemplation and self-doubt is briefly replaced with a deceptive sense of optimism. “But it’s alright, sleep tight, I will take the strain,” McCartney warbles, almost reassuringly, before swiftly transitioning back to his former pessimistic, contemplative and existentialist frame of mind. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If “I don’t know” produces the impression that at age 76, McCartney is now fatigued and ready to slow down, pop rock songs such as “Come On To Me” and “Fuh You” are quick to suggest otherwise. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“If you come on to me, I’ll come on to you,” McCartney chants between a sequence of animated doot-doo-doos in the former track, while a similarly salacious “You make we wanna go out and steal. … I just want to fuh you” marks the latter. With McCartney’s age and knighthood in mind, this vulgarity is somewhat shocking. While it seems unlikely that the singer-songwriter is attempting to belie his age, it is possible that he is trying to lend a contemporary vibe to his music. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As “Egypt Station” rolls along, McCartney delves into themes ranging from love and friendship to politics. Amid constant shifts in mood and tempo, he condemns President Donald Trump in “Despite Repeated Warnings,” discusses family life in “Back in Brazil,” reminisces about his drug usage in “Happy With You” and reflects on friendship in “Confidante.” Despite being a fusion of such starkly contrasting pieces of music, the vicissitudes of the album, somehow, do not seem uncomfortable at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The records retain incredible musicality, while simultaneously being a reflection of McCartney’s stream of consciousness. Indeed, while much of McCartney’s solo records may have had questionable success, it’s safe to say that “Egypt Station” really nails its tracks.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The only thing eerier than Providence’s chilly weather is finding a sculpture that appears to mimic its stormy mood. That’s exactly what patrons of the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts found in David Bowen’s scupture exhibition, “Observers and Creators,” last Thursday. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Bowen’s installations generally explored<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the interactions between nature and technology. The three sculptures showcased tensions between artistic agency and art’s ability to exist independent of its creator.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The exhibit was installed in late August and will continue to occupy the Cohen Gallery until Sept. 22.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In Bowen’s newest piece, titled “5twigs,” he found five sticks and 3-D printed an exact replica of each of them. The pale, plastic copies are fixed above their natural wooden equivalent, creating perfectly symmetrical halves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mounted on a dimly lit white wall, the nondescript installation does not immediately catch the viewer’s eyes. The piece seems to play on how closely the visitor pays attention to the clandestine details of the exhibition. The artificial aspects “play a trick on (viewers’) eyes,” said John Dall’Aglio ’19. “I thought they were shadows at first.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many of the attendees at Thursday’s reception were interested not only in the installations’ messages, but also in their material function and the artistic process behind their creation. “Tele-Present Wind” proved to be confusing to visitors such as Deepak Khirwar ’19, who ultimately found the technological and modern themes compelling, he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the work, 42 dried plant stalks are attached to mechanisms on the floor that imitate the movement of plants in the wind. The piece had visitors guessing why the stalks were moving, with some positing that the movement of the visitors elicited the wind-like effects through motion sensors. “It makes me wonder what’s happening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then I wonder why I’m intrigued by something so dead,” Dall’Algio said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In actuality, as Bowen himself explained on the exhibition flyer, “the individual components of the installation are moving in unison as they mimic the direction and intensity of the wind from 1,300 miles away.” Sensors located at the University of Minnesota provide real-time data to direct the sculpture’s movement. But as a result of the sudden rain and wind on Thursday evening, it seemed to many as though the stalks were mimicking the weather directly outside of the gallery, lending an immediacy to the sculpture. A maze of wires on the floor blurred the lines between natural and artificial. “It looks like roots and vines. He could have set the wires in straight lines to be more efficient,” Khirwar said, pointing to the lengths that Bowen went to recreate nature through technology.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Growth Rendering Device,” Bowen’s oldest sculpture on display, is a system in which a small plant relies on light and food provided by a device. The device also records the plant’s real-time growth through “rasterized inkjet drawings” produced every 24 hours on a long roll of paper, according to the flyer. Bowen explained that “Growth Rendering Device” has undergone this process many times before, and that the plant has grown to be quite large in previous incarnations of the sculpture. “Right now it’s more of a death rendering device,” Bowen said, gesturing to the small and inconsistent growth recorded on the paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Looking at the piece, Dall’Aglio was interested in how nature is sustained by synthetic mechanisms in Bowen’s work. “The plant has become inauthentic and (is) sustained by inauthenticity,” he said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A new mural on the east-facing wall of 32 Custom House Street in downtown Providence began illuminating the cityscape this month, as Baltimore-based artist Gaia completed work on “Still Here,” a large-scale work commissioned by Providence non-profit The Avenue Concept. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Covering the entire facade of the building, the mural<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>features a woman in a patch of bright-yellow sunflowers, strawberries, cattails and red-winged blackbirds. This woman is Lynsea Montanari, a member of the Narragansett tribe and an educator at the Tomaquag Museum in Exeter, Rhode Island, according to a press release issued by The Avenue Concept. Her eyes are directed straight ahead at the passing cars of Memorial Boulevard, the Providence River and the pedestrians on South Water Street, and she tenderly holds a black-and-white photograph of Princess Red Wing, described by the Tomaquag Museum’s website as a “Narragansett/Pokanoket Wampanoag historian and educator” who founded the museum sixty years ago. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gaia bases his work “heavily in community and historical facts,” said Nicholas Platzer, the 2-D program manager for The Avenue Concept. His planning process, Platzer explained, includes researching the location, reaching out for community support and searching for active community members — such as Montanari — whom he involves in his composition and design process. The wall is located close to Weybosset Street, “named for an indigenous footpath, and a trading location that later became one of the first custom houses in America,” the Avenue Concept press release explained. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This process made Gaia, an internationally renowned muralist whose works adorn buildings in major cities such as Seoul, Buenos Aires, Amsterdam, and London, the perfect candidate for this project, Platzer said. The owner of the wall — a retaining wall that once belonged to a building that stood in what is now a parking lot<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— wanted a mural that was figurative but told a story with “layers and depth to it,” Platzer said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gaia focused on “erasure,” Platzer said, paying particular attention to the experiences of indigenous people in Rhode Island. This inspired The Avenue Concept and Gaia to reach out to the Tomaquag Museum, which immediately joined the project as part of their sixtieth anniversary celebration. “If we’re going to depict this history of this indigenous community here, we don’t want to just be doing it in a vacuum — we want to partner with someone in that community who can speak to the history,” said John Taraborelli of The Avenue Concept. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“A city without public art is kind of ridiculous,” Platzer said and emphasized the ways in which public art “inspirespeople and gets (them) to stop — even for just a minute.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Camille Champ, a front-of-house supervisor at the Knead Doughnuts Custom House location, described the mural as “absolutely breathtaking,” acknowledging the number of people she has witnessed admiring the mural on her drive into work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“That’s what public art does — it kind of interjects itself into people’s lives,” Platzer said, adding that it is different than art found in a gallery or a museum, which requires an individual to intentionally look at art.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other murals commissioned by The Avenue Concept include those by Polish street artists BEZT, “She Never Came,” and Natalia Rak, “Adventure Time,” which face each other in the parking lot at the corner of Mathewson and Washington Streets. Another new mural, by The Avenue Concept’s 2018 2-D Resident Local Artist Sam White, “Party Shark — Seals Galore,” continues the nonprofit’s rotating mural project on the facade of the Providence National Bank, where it will remain for one year. This is the third mural to be introduced to this wall, replacing Umberto Crenca’s “Takes All Types.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Taraborelli hopes that this mural will help to spread the visibility of not just the nonprofit, but also the city of Providence, as The Avenue Concept installations have previously garnered a large presence on social media.“The ones we’ve done until now have been kind of tucked around corners, and you have to go look for them, but this is one that just tens of thousands of people are going to drive by or walk by every day … that visibility is huge for us,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tuesday night, fans filled Columbus Theater to see 90s indie rock band Yo La Tengo — the creation of New Jersey husband-and-wife duo Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley — perform simple, sleepily ambivalent love songs and encourage audience members to exercise their civic duties.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Started in 1984 by Kaplan and Hubley (now ages 61 and 58, respectively), Yo La Tengo is a 30-year-old sonic experiment with a major cult following that doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The band has released an album every year since 2013, each of which has defied the contemporary era’s indie archetype by staying faithful to the outfit’s emotional moorings. The couple’s newest album, released March 16<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>with Matador Records, is called “There’s a Riot Going On” — a coy reference to the 1970s funk band Sly and the Family Stone’s cynical, political album by the same name. Tinged with gentle philosophical undertones, the album contains tracks like<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She May, She Might” and “For You Too” that offer the listener a what-will-be-will-be sense of acoustic understanding. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “I am just some guy / Maybe I could be that guy?” sings Kaplan softly in “For You Too,” a song whose operative word is “maybe.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yo La Tengo is a tight act on stage — serious and utilitarian in the way it handles its instruments. There’s no “How are we doing tonight, Providence?” fanfare when the band opens; the lights flick on and the pair begins digging into a long instrumental piece that incorporates gutteral howls, radio static and the buzzing of cicadas as it builds. When Kaplan begins to sing muted lyrics in his mid-century-documentary-narrator voice, the crowd goes wild. An elderly woman in front of me whispers to her neighbor, “Is that other guy playing a massive violin?” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The “other guy” she referenced is James McNew — Yo La Tengo’s 14th bassist. He’s been with the band since 1992 and is sometimes credited for establishing them as a contemporary genre mainstay.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After a half dozen songs, Kaplan finally addressed the audience — “Providence! It’s been a while since I’ve been here. Maybe it will be a while till I come back,” he said with characteristic ambivalence. Comically awkward, all of his sentences tumbled out lopsided:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When I was in middle school there were these footlights on our stage,” he said, pointing to the footlights at the edge of the stage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Kind of like these footlights here, so I’m distracted. Were there footlights in your schools?” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No one responded.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the band is most often lauded for its ability to manufacture tranquility and, in the words of Pitchfork writer Ed Harvey, “sonic care,” it clearly has some serious rock-and-roll chops. In the second half of the set, it played early headbanger favorites like “Sugarcube,” and Kaplan’s electric guitar-playing defied what one might think realistically possible. Crouching, Kaplan held the guitar upside down and waved it around as he played, looking more like a contortionist than Slash. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the band said goodnight and exited the stage, the crowd cheered them back on only to receive a strangely executed talking-to, which preceded the band’s cover of Sun Ra’s “Nuclear War.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m not really sure what elections you have going on here,” Kaplan said. “But I’m going to take this opportunity to attempt to tell people to vote.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>“Joy + Justice” builds community through art</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/17/joy-justice-builds-community-art/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Thursday, the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America hosted the opening of “Joy + Justice,” a new exhibit that celebrates the Center’s upcoming programs and events. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a letter posted and distributed at the front of the exhibit, Tricia Rose, the director of CSREA, wrote that the exhibit was curated with artists whose works “capture the nuanced means by which joy is made just, and justice is fueled by the hope and possibility that joy represents.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The theme of “Joy + Justice” resonated with Kaila Johnson ’19, a student assistant at CSREA. “I feel like it is really exhausting being a person of color and also just studying issues of social justice and doing work with social justice,” Johnson said, and added that CSREA holds that finding joy within battles for social justice, moments of oppression and in daily life is necessary for overall well-being. “We believe that you can get more work done in organizing, in studying (and) in existing if you do have that balance,” Johnson said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The exhibit features 38 works of art created by 22 artists from around the world, some of whom are Brown alums. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Among the works, one wall in a back room of CSREA displays multiple renditions of hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bursting with vibrant colors, John Viet-Triet Hoa Nguyen’s “Band Together” is a graphic representation of hands locked together in a powerful grip. “Never Let Me Go II,” by Nadja, an elegant black line drawing of two hands that reach up and cross in a tight grasp, is displayed next to “Band Together.” Other pieces include a series of black and white photographs by Pilar Vergara and colorful, abstract portraits by Luanne Redeye. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stéphanie Larrieux, associate director of CSREA, said that she appreciates the “way that (the pieces) all speak to each other and really … carry the theme forward.” Larrieux curated the exhibit with Caitlin Scott, outreach coordinator and executive assistant for CSREA, and Alex Parker-Guerrero GS, a CSREA curatorial fellow. “Even the media that is represented is rather diverse, so we really tried to curate works that spoke to that inclusivity,” Larrieux said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Larrieux added that the exhibit fits with the Center’s overall belief that art has the ability to both move and challenge people. “Art is definitely a way in which people can engage with new ideas,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Johnson emphasized that CSREA does not only have speaker events and lectures but also tries to build a community within the undergraduate population. “Most events have something to do with issues of oppression, race and ethnicity,” she said. “But we want to set the groundwork this year to have an underlying emphasis on community-building, support and joy within those spaces of study.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the exhibition letter, Rose defined the exhibition’s joy as “a choice to love in spite of hate; to be hopeful in the face of hopelessness; to connect with each other when walls and wars force us apart.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This past weekend, improvisers from Montreal, Providence and other cities came together at AS220 for three laugh-packed days of performances, workshops and celebratory festivities at the Providence Improv Festival. P!F brings big-name headliners like the Upright Citizens Brigade’s Women and Men team and North Coast Improv to perform alongside local groups of varying narrative focuses and skill levels. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The festival tradition began in 2004 as an informal showcase for the local improv groups Improv Jones, Speed of Thought Players and Unexpected Company. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In setting up the festival, “we wanted to show<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(the community) how fun and great improv is, not only for those who want to perform but for people who want to open up and engage with the world in a new way,” said Tim Thibodeau, P!F’s producer and artistic director.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since then, the number of performers has “at least quadrupled,” and the festival has become one of the most beloved community events of the year, with “nearly every show sold out,” Thibodeau said. The festival has also accrued a number of generous sponsors, including Wage House, the Providence Improv Guild, Motif Magazine and the Pawtucket Credit Union.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thibodeau added that even as the festival grows in size,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the talent of the local groups measures up to national groups. “The headliners like North Coast (Improv) are above-and-beyond amazing,” but the groups that continue to return are “very talented.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Providence improv community is “very robust” and “engaged in the local community” according to Providence Improv Guild member Emily Levesque-Gottlieb. Outside of performing and practicing, members organize group cemetery cleanups and volunteer at food banks. The group donated the proceeds of its Family Friendly Show on Saturday to the Manton Avenue Project, a nonprofit that pairs grade-school children with adult actors and playwrights to help them write their own plays.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Organizing the three-day festival takes nine months and poses some difficulties. Eric Fulford, a coordinator for the festival and performer with Jackpot!, a team within the Providence Improv Guild, said that organizing the festival can be “a bit like wrangling cats,” citing performers’ “flighty” tendencies. “Keeping them in one place at a given time is the main challenge,” Fulford said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Still, Fulford says the payoff is more than worthwhile: “I love getting to see different types of improv and different takes on forms and games that we’re all familiar with.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s a reason why a lot of the groups from outside the state want to keep coming back,” said Thibodeau. “A lot of them say it’s their favorite festival. It’s not about making money for us, it’s about celebrating what we do and making it a big party for everyone.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Point Street Readings </b></span></p>
<p class="p2">The next iteration of the storied Point Street Readings series, headed and curated by bibliophile and Providence radio DJ Robin Kall, will take place at the Alchemy bookstore tonight. Writers performing include Nova Ren Suma, Suzanne Matson, Blair Hurley, Delia Owens and Professor of Political Science Corey Brettschnieder. The event, in partnership with the Brown University Bookstore, will have copies of the authors’ works available for purchase and signing. Doors open at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>“La Haine” Screening</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Join members of the Brown Center for Language Studies for a screening of the seminal, heavily stylized French film “La Haine.” Originally released in 1995, the monochrome film’s narrative concerns the poverty, racial tensions and police brutality faced by three inhabitants of a French housing project. The event serves as the inaugural screening of the Center for Language Studies’ newly created series, “Foreign Flicks Presents.” The movie will play at 7:00 p.m. Wednesday in Metcalf Auditorium.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>“¿Se Aculilló? | La sutura tierna” </b></span></p>
<p class="p2">The Granoff Center for the Creative Arts will play host to a number of performances put on by Athena Washburn, Aretha Busby, Kei Soares Cobb, Orlando Hernández, Farah Figuereo, Doménica Garcia and Rebelené. These performances come to audiences as part of “¿Se Aculilló? | La sutura tierna,” the third installment of a multi-media exhibition series that will appear in both Granoff and the Resident Gallery at AS220 this month. The exhibit, whose name roughly expresses the sentiment “Are you scared? The tender suture,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>features art and accompanying performances that coalesce around the theme of a shared Latinx/Latine identity, according to a <a href="http://www.jointhebenjam.org/call/">press release</a> written by the exhibition’s curators, Benjamin Lundberg Torres Sánchez and Kat Chavez. Sponsored by AS220 and the Brown Arts Initiative, the performances will begin at 7:00 p.m. Thursday.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Machines with Magnets Show </b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Catch rapper Iris Creamer and experimental bands La Neve, Light Beams, Space Heater and Algiers at the Pawtucket venue Machines with Magnets Friday. Partially funded by the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, the concert bill will couple some of Providence’s most active artists with headlining band Algiers. The show welcomes all ages and will kick off at 7:45 p.m.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Monday afternoon, the room fell silent as composer and performer Courtney Bryan played a recording of “Sanctum,” which she composed as a response to police brutality. Some attendees of Bryan’s performance at Orwig Music Library closed their eyes in attentiveness as they listened to the 12-minute-long musical composition. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bryan, an assistant professor of music at Tulane University, was invited to participate in “Music Now,” an informal series created by the Department of Music that brings composers, sound artists and performers to the University to discuss their music. Bryan is “known for collaborating across genres with a whole range of artists, so I think, especially given the interdisciplinary focus of Brown, it’s really interesting to our students and faculty to see her approach to making music,” said Eric Nathan, assistant professor of music composition-theory and one of the founders of “Music Now.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bryan began her lecture by explaining that her recent work has been a series of responses to police brutality, beginning with “saved” in 2013. Inspired by the IMPACT Repertory Theatre, an arts and activism group for young people, Bryan worked with three different church choirs to create a piece based on tradition and improvisation. With each choir, Bryan discussed the lynchings of Laura and L.D. Nelson in 1911, which had prompted her to create “Saved.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She and the respective choirs then followed a basic musical structure to improvise a response to that history. “It was the first piece I did that had a direct theme of racial violence. It had a really big impact on me,” Bryan said. She related how some of the choir members “went to another place spiritually” during the recording. One young choir member had a vision of a man with a machete while performing, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Saved” led to “Sanctum,” which was originally performed by the American Composers Orchestra at the Lincoln Center in 2015. In her talk on Monday, Bryan broke down different influences in the composition, from the “whooping” of the holiness-preaching tradition to modern protests chants, she explained. In “Sanctum,” she also incorporated recordings pertaining to situations and victims of police brutality, such as an interview with Marlene Pinnock, a woman who was beaten by a police officer on a highway in 2014. When the ethics of the use of such recordings were questioned by a student, Bryan assured them that such creative practices were legal and that she intended to share her music with the people whose voices she had used.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After explaining the themes and influences present in “Sanctum,” Bryan played a recording of the entire piece. She then briefly spoke about one of her recent compositions “Yet Unheard,” which she helped write in honor of Sandra Bland, a young black woman who was found dead in her prison cell in Texas three days after her arrest at a traffic stop.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Attendees of the event were most struck by Bryan’s live performance. “When composers are giving lectures in that room, they rarely perform live. She also spoke the prayer at the start and the names of unarmed black victims of police brutality at the end. That kind of live experience is not something that we get that much in these lectures, at least not yet,” said Seamus Hubbard Flynn ’21. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Deven Carmichael ’21 also commented on the live performance, saying, “It’s powerful music, both recorded and live, but it’s just so completely moving to see someone actively playing that music. It’s really physical during some parts — she’s smashing notes. Seeing the kineticness and actions and motions that she’s using to create these sounds was really engaging.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A memorial exhibition for artist and Professor Emeritus of Visual Arts Walter Feldman opened at the David Winton Bell Gallery last Friday. The opening — an emotional, heartfelt tribute to Feldman — included remembrances from his family and a critical discussion of Feldman’s work by esteemed art historian Donald Kuspit.</p>
<p class="p2">Feldman taught at the University for 54 years — beginning in 1953 and retiring in 2007. Feldman passed away at the age of 92 in May 2017.</p>
<p class="p2">The event began with an introduction from President Christina Paxson P’19. Paxson reflected on Feldman’s effect on students at the University. A particularly poignant example was that of a student from the class of 1959 who credited his late professor with changing the trajectory of his studies and easing his path to architecture in his senior year. This anecdote spoke to Feldman’s sensitivity as a teacher, his talent as an artist and his down-to-earth demeanor as a friend, Paxson said. Feldman’s nephew and godson, author Daniel Asa Rose ’71,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>celebrated Feldman by speaking to Feldman’s fatherly presence in his life. He read a poem titled “Shifting the Sun” by Diana Der-Hovanessian and reflected on Feldman’s contributions to the world through the lens of the famous Walt Whitman verse from “O Me! O Life!”: “That you are here — that life exists, and identity, / That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse,” he recited.</p>
<p class="p2">“As evidence(d) by the peerless art in these rooms, and enough art to fill a hundred more gallery rooms, we can rest assured that Walter Feldman did indeed contribute a verse, a mighty verse, and we will love him for it forever,” Rose said.</p>
<p class="p2">The exhibit includes work spanning 68 years of Feldman’s life. As Kuspit pointed out, he completed more than 2,000 works throughout his career, including paintings in oil, gouache, watercolor, acrylic and stencils as well as collages of handmade paper and wodcut prints. The Bell Gallery’s selected works, curated by Director Jo-Ann Conklin, reflect this range, as paintings and collages are shown alongside glass cases displaying examples of the letter-press books he produced.</p>
<p class="p2">“Walter’s work evolved both stylistically and technically over his long career, and always in the service of the yin and yang of subjects that he cared about — those being family, nature, music and poetry, religion and the cruelty of war,” Conklin said.</p>
<p class="p2">One of the first pieces displayed in the exhibition is the only realistic self-portrait ever created by Feldman, finished in the late 1940s shortly after his return from World War II. In the portrait, Feldman’s figure is shaded, fading into a muted gray background. His eyes look down behind wide-framed glasses. In an interview with Kathryn de Boer that appeared in “Points in Time: Walter Feldman Selected Works,” published by Ziggurat Press, Feldman said of the portrait,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think that was how I must have felt inside — gray.”</p>
<p class="p2">Barbara Feldman, Feldman’s wife of almost 67 years, reminded the audience that this exhibition “was not meant to be a memorial exhibition, it was conceived of simply as an exhibition,” she said. Feldman had intended to be in attendance, she reminded the audience. “However, I do not wish to imply that he is not with us at this time,” she added, “because the very nature and being of this man — his visual and textual manifestations — are apparent and boldly looking over our shoulders and calling to our sensibilities.”</p>
<p class="p2">“The Final Agony,” which hangs on the opposite wall of “Self-Portrait,” was the first woodcut print created by Feldman. According to the piece’s informational plaque, Feldman decided to enter the piece into a competition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on a whim — and went on to win the print prize.</p>
<p class="p2">Kuspit discussed a selection of Feldman’s work, emphasizing its range and thematic focuses, while offering his interpretation of some of Feldman’s abstract works. Kuspit touched on “The Final Agony” and another print titled “Expulsion” in his lecture. These were “unequivocal masterpieces, brilliantly conveying the trauma of war and the traumatic effect it had on Feldman,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Paxson closed her introduction by emphasizing, “Everybody at Brown … is grateful for Walter, for the gifts that he gave to this University over so many years and for the marvelous, marvelous legacy that he leaves to the world and to this community,” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Rhode Island School of Design Museum gave visitors a preview of the objects, exhibitions and renovations coming to the museum in the near and distant future during a talk last Thursday titled “Today and Tomorrow: Museum Update.” The event kicked off the September edition of Third Thursday, a monthly cost-free event night at the museum. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The talk was planned to give the museum’s members, donors and visitors — the patrons that keep the museum alive and active —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a behind-the-scenes look at the museum’s inner-workings, said Director John Smith, who spoke during the talk. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the last fiscal year, the museum reached a high of nearly 120,000 visitors — a significant increase from past years, when the number of visitors generally ranged between 85,000 and 100,000 people, Smith said. This increase “means that the message about the museum and what we’re doing is getting out to our community and exciting people,” Smith said. It also “goes against a larger national trend in museum attendance, which in many places … is declining — in some places at a very rapid rate,” he added. The museum held about 1,100 programs in the last fiscal year and drew in nearly 30,000 of the 120,000 visitors during various events for adults and students. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some of the major projects Smith detailed are a part of the upcoming exhibition “Repair and Design Futures,” which “uses textiles as a metaphor for mending and repair throughout our society, throughout our culture,” Smith said. Smith also talked about the museum’s plans to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the exhibition titled “Raid the Icebox” curated by Andy Warhol in 1969-1970. The original project directors invited Warhol to create an exhibition from the museum’s existing collection, which “was both a scandal and a success at the time,” Smith said. The museum has invited ten artists and artist-collectives to rethink the task, with related projects to be rolled out over several months, Smith explained.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Associate Curator of Costume and Textiles Laurie Brewer discussed one of the museum’s recent additions to the department’s 30,000 object collection<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— a fish leather jacket created by American designer Rick Owens as part of his 2016 “Mastodon” collection. Owens’ collection explored his uneasiness about environmental change, Brewer said. The leather, made from the durable skin of a large Brazilian pirarucu fish, was once a waste product thrown out in the process of cooking the fish’s meat but has been turned into a viable economic resource for communities in the Amazonian region to which the fish is native, Brewer said. This piece fits into Brewer’s personal concerns of human ecology and textiles but also into the larger collection, she said, as it joins other pieces made of aquatic materials, such as a purse composed of walrus leather that has had a place in the collection since 1958. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This additional piece exemplifies one of the other key thematic tenets of Smith’s presentation — the growth of the museum’s collection and the new ways in which the collection will be displayed. Along with an increase in the number of items available for viewers online, Smith outlined plans for the renovation and reopening of Gallery C9, the museum’s original exhibition space built in 1897, which has been closed for almost a decade, he said. The renovation will bring the gallery up to date on fire and safety codes and create room for the display of more objects. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Gina Borromeo, the museum’s curator of ancient art, discussed some of the ethical concerns of exhibiting ancient objects in her presentation on research conducted on Nesmin, the museum’s resident mummy. Though Nesmin’s body has been displayed outside of his coffin in the past, the museum is “now rethinking whether it is ethical at all to show human remains in an art museum, and so we are in the process of putting Nesmin back in the coffin, where he will once again be embraced by Nut and surrounded by protective sky creatures,” Borromeo said, emphasizing that learning about ancient Egyptian funeral practices will still be possible without viewing the body. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The coffin that Nesmin was buried in gives insight into his life, Borromeo said. One section of hieroglyphs explains not only that he was priest of the fertility gods but also that the previous five generations of his family were as well, she added. The detail provided on the inscriptions of his coffin has allowed researchers make a connection between Nesmin and his mummified relatives. His father is currently being preserved at the Cairo Museum, and his grandfather, also named Nesmin, is on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Borromeo said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Distinguished Senior Lecturer in German Studies Jane Sokolosky was named the new director of the Center for Language Studies this past June, she decided that she wanted to give students the ability to access languages in a “study break, daily routine, casual” sort of way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She concluded that the best way to realize this goal was through a weekly foreign film screening that would showcase some of the most venerated and loved films made in every language. To curate the film selections and run the screenings, she reached out to two extremely enthusiastic, film-savvy students in her Intensive German class, Layla Beckhardt ’20 and Emine Ciger ’21. Ciger was already working as a projectionist for the Modern Culture and Media department, and both girls were “always talking about films in class,” according to Ciger.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now every Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the Metcalf Auditorium, the CLS will host a foreign film screening, with each week featuring a film in a different language. Last week, the group showed “La Haine,” a 1995 French black-and-white drama that follows three first-generation immigrant boys in the twenty-four hours that transpired after a violent riot killed their friend. This film was chosen because it “combines amazing stylistic technique with subtle messages of the political situation in France,” according to Beckhardt.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beckhardt and Ciger have compiled a “huge Excel spreadsheet” of foreign movies that they enjoy, but they are also reaching out to student and faculty language groups to inform their selections. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If it’s a film from a culture that we’re not acquainted with, we’ll find someone” who can identify seminal films from that area, Ciger said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Next week, they will screen “In The Mood for Love,” a beloved Chinese romance-drama from 2000. In the future, they plan to show films in languages such as Persian, Russian and German, and they will partner with the Korean Student Association and the Southeast Asian Studies Initiative to bring undergraduates films in Korean and Vietnamese.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Aside from the film series, the CLS plans to launch other new initiatives to inform people about different languages and cultures. They are going to start holding lunchtime language tables in Faunce so that students can learn about less-spoken languages and get information about student groups and events. Recently, the CLS prompted the University to start offering Yoruba through distance learning with Cornell, and they are looking into offering Vietnamese on Brown’s campus. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At First Year Orientation, the CLS hosted a language panel featuring over fifteen upperclassmen who spoke about about their experiences learning languages at Brown and the doors that languages opened for them. “Someone was an artist-in-residence in Russia, someone taught English in Germany. It’s so cool,” Sokolosky said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“One of my goals is to bring languages into the center of campus at Brown. Learning a language is a really important part of being a global citizen,” she added. “Now undergraduates know that Wednesdays mean they can watch a foreign film at Brown.”</span></p>
<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly referred to the Southeast Asian Studies Initiative as the South East Asian Studies Group. An earlier version of the article also misspelled the name of the French film "La Haine." The Herald regrets the errors. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Searching’ fails to realize Asian American cinema</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/24/searching-fails-realize-asian-american-cinema/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Searching,” the debut film of director Aneesh Chaganty, opens up by presenting a very Silicon Valley family in a very Silicon Valley way: David Kim (John Cho) and Pamela Kim (Sara Sohn) are pictured raising their daughter Margot (Michelle La) entirely through the perspective of a computer screen, every childhood moment neatly compartmentalized and stilted. Margot’s entire adolescence is seemingly mediated through the dim, digitized hyperreal — birthdays are shown on video files, important dates are shown through calendar events and family pranks are uploaded on YouTube. When Margot enters high school, Pamela passes away from cancer, setting off a chain of events: Margot eventually goes missing and David subsequently transforms into a vengeful father desperately tracking down his daughter. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Searching” opened earlier this year at Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film Prize. In late August, it debuted in theaters nationwide, garnering a 92% Rotten Tomatoes rating and $50 million at the box office. The movie primarily features a Korean American cast, which includes only one significant non-Korean character who is cast as an FBI agent. Though the film technically constitutes the first major thriller headlined by an Asian American, “Searching” has been almost completely disregarded for its landmark casting, especially compared to the other major Asian American film of the summer: “Crazy Rich Asians.” Critics and audiences have talked about “Searching” in regards to its plot rather than its cast, while Crazy Rich Asians has been talked about in regards to its cast rather than its plot. “Searching,” for critics, appears to be no more than a thriller in which Asians happen to take part, while “Crazy Rich Asians” is nothing short of an Asian American movement, heralded for its watershed casting decisions while escaping any of the derision that could be directed at its reductive plot. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At its surface, “Searching” appears much more representative of Asian America than “Crazy Rich Asians.” It takes place in the heartland of model minority excellence, Silicon Valley, and centers itself around a full Korean family, complete with an engineering dad and a piano playing, AP Biology-taking daughter. However, this is where the purported “Asian Americanness” of the film ends; once the central search for Margot begins, the shortcomings of the movie quickly become evident. After the film’s exposition, the characters, namely David, become essentially raceless and devoid of deeper identity, and turn into vehicles that simply serve to push the plot along. The computer screen framing of the film further reduces actors to one dimensional digital personas; David even turns his supposed “suspect list” into an Excel doc, where Facebook profile photos are paired next to one sentence bios. As a result, it is no wonder why critics have ignored the supposedly revolutionary casting of the film and instead focused squarely on its genre and technical gimmickry. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Searching” should have been as much about David’s growth as it was a crime mystery, but instead does almost nothing to take advantage of John Cho’s excellent acting, depriving him of any serious chance of development while under crisis. As Richard Brody of The New Yorker <a href="http://link? https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/searching-reviewed-a-lifeless-thriller-plays-out-on-a-computer-screen">writes</a>, “for all its reflection of secrets and traits both contained and dispersed in a person’s digital identity, it (“Searching”) offers almost nothing of its characters’ identities. It renders them virtually faceless and lacking in inclinations, interests, and idiosyncrasies.” Asian Americanness aside, the film only allows Cho to vacillate between two emotions: rage and despair, and even these emotions are dulled through being presented through a distilling, secondary medium (FaceTime, voice call). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, filmmakers should never be responsible for educating viewers on racial histories and intricacies, but the film falls flat largely because character development—Asian American character development, informed heavily by racial histories and intricacies—is ignored. Director Aneesh Chaganty—himself a Bay Area, second generation Asian American— may have intended for “Searching” to be an attempt to normalize Asians on screen, implicitly saying that they are no different from their white counterparts. The effect of this decision, however, is that the Kim family could seamlessly be replaced with the family from “Roseanne” or any family from “Modern Family” with no serious changes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Undoubtedly, “Searching” kept me captivated from beginning to end. However, as a Korean American viewer, I constantly longed to see more meaningful moments, especially in regards to David’s inability to address grief with his daughter, which served as an unexplained underpinning that set the plot of the movie in action. The film could have presciently explored how Asian Americans suppress any acknowledgement of trauma between generations, trauma that subsequently bleeds through in more insidious ways. I also longed for a better understanding of David’s isolation during the period after his wife’s death—the film vitally misses a window to situate this isolation in terms of Han, the distinctly Korean mode of collective suffering, as well as the profound isolation many adult Asian Americans undergo in periods of grief, as many are separated from their families by thousands of miles. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">I began to wonder if this is what mainstream “Asian American cinema,” a genre that does not currently exist, had to be, one in which either everything Asian American is rendered inconsequential (“Searching”) or in which everything Asian American is pulled to the extremities of lavish excess (“Crazy Rich Asians”). I thought of the small budget Asian American films made in past decades, such as 2002’s Better Luck Tomorrow, in which John Cho and a cast of Asian American actors violently overturn their high achieving student lifestyles, or the gripping Asian American narratives presented by the Asian American “Class of ‘97,” in which John Cho, again, took part in. Twenty years later, it appears that the industry enforced stereotyping and whitewashing that comes with the transition from small budget to major studios is as firm as ever, and it is still largely accepted that this is a necessary first step to creating a more authentic Asian American cinema—but is it? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Summer 2018 has been a particularly fecund time for Asian American cinema, with titles such as “Killing Eve,” “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” “Kim’s Convenience” and the obvious “Crazy Rich Asians.” John Cho himself has signed on to star in Alan Yang’s forthcoming “Tigertail,” a Netflix film about a Taiwanese immigrant family that will hopefully explore the East Asian American family in a more substantive way than “Searching.” Nevertheless, “Searching” meaningfully contributes to this list of films, providing much-welcomed on-screen representation—albeit in an aspirationally white, model minority type of way. It is only my regret that a movie that could have been a powerful meditation on the grief and trauma of the dissolution of the Asian American family became a nondescript, meek facsimile of “Taken.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">From the very beginning of Craig Macneill’s film “Lizzie,” viewers are right behind the fierce female protagonist, played by Chloë Sevigny. We watch her walk into the impending murder scene, we hear a scream, then see her stepmother’s corpse on the ground next to the infamous date: August 4, 1892.</p>
<p class="p2">In 1892, the real Lizzie Borden was tried for —­ and acquitted of — her father and stepmother’s axe murders in Fall River, Massachusetts. Was she a fiery, passionate woman, suffocated by the patriarchy until her resentment boiled into violence? Perhaps — that’s certainly how Macneill portrays her. This new take on the age-old story of the Borden murders presents a radical explanation for the mysterious bloody deaths of Andrew Borden (played by Jamey Sheridan) and Abby Borden (Fiona Shaw).</p>
<p class="p2">Though it leans toward the trope of the 19th-century madwoman — painting Lizzie as a rebellious spinster whose defiant outbursts and epileptic fits lead her father to consider sending her away — this depiction of the Borden murders packs a feminist punch. Lizzie holds immense power on screen, and while rejecting her father, she casts off other oppressive forces as well, from the corset around her waist to the legal barriers blocking her inheritance.</p>
<p class="p2">Bridget (Kristen Stewart), the Bordens’ new Irish maid, is the perfect complement to Lizzie. She appears timid, and there is an instant connection between her and the strong and unruly spinster. The two become secret lovers and partners in crime, sharing intimate moments in a shed where Lizzie goes to escape from her repressive household. Lizzie teaches Bridget to read, Bridget helps Lizzie dress and undress and together they make a powerful pair.</p>
<p class="p2">Bridget faces domination by Lizzie’s father as well — every night he comes into her room and rapes her. But it is Lizzie who fights back, scattering pieces of a broken mirror outside of Bridget’s door for her father to step on as he flees the site of his sin. Lizzie sees her father’s vulnerability — he regularly receives threatening notes, and she undertakes the dangerous task of tracing their origins. Lizzie faces violence and ridicule for questioning male authority, but her strong will keeps her going.</p>
<p class="p2">Macneill’s feminist reimagination of this classic murder mystery walks the line between thriller and old-fashioned drama. Women often fill the screen, sometimes stoic and other times quivering with emotion. The film jumps around in time, revealing more about Lizzie and about the murders as the story unfolds. Viewers have the chance to see the opening scene three times throughout the course of the film, suspense building each time we see the body beside the date. At the end of it all is a fervent, unstoppable woman hacking away at the patriarchy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Art to Reduce Mental Health Stigma kicked off Friday night with the Express Your Psych Open Mic Night, an event aimed at creating a safe space in Providence for individuals to illuminate and express their experiences with mental health through all mediums of art.</p>
<p class="p2">A nonprofit established this summer by co-founders Nicole Spring ’20.5 and former Herald Metro Editor Mirabella Roberts ’20, ARMS aims to combat the stigma surrounding mental health by directly encouraging conversations on the subject. Events like Express Your Psych are just the start of many initiatives directed at promoting dialogue on mental health.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Spring and Roberts were motivated to curate events like Express Your Psych after realizing the necessity of safe spaces to discuss mental health. Express Your Psych encourages University students and other Providence residents to communicate their experiences with mental illness through art, Roberts said, adding that she hopes to challenge stigma around mental health by “starting conversations,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>… and hopefully (developing) a space where people aren’t afraid to be themselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Express Your Psych included “spoken-word,” “original music” and “stories,” Roberts said. Creating a sincerely safe space where individuals could express themselves enabled audience members to feel “welcome to speak about (their) mental illness” — a common refrain left behind in ARMS’ response cards after the event.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These response cards, which showed the audience’s feedback on the event, were overwhelmingly positive, as the majority of respondents expressed interest in future events and stated that the event influenced their perception of mental health stigma, Spring said. “Those who said that their perception wasn’t changed … usually (were) people who have experienced mental illness already … or were very aware of what mental illness is like,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Spring, Express Your Psych required extensive planning during the summer. After the initial success of ARMS, an interactive art gallery that featured an open mic Sept. 6, the organization decided to continue its programming. “We planned and got the space (at AS220) booked early summer,” Spring said. “Once we got to school, we met in person to go over how we wanted to promote the event and (to) gather names of people who wanted to perform.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">ARMS’ Express Your Psych coincided with the University’s football game against Harvard, which created a possible obstacle for attendance at the new nonprofit’s event, Spring said. However, Express Your Psych<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“had a little over forty people show up, so (ARMS is) really optimistic about future events that are not at the same time as Brown events,” Spring said. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Melissa Sierra ’20, the recruitment officer of ARMS, described her overall experience with ARMS as very positive. She emphasized the importance of ARMS’ purpose and impact on campus culture, as well as the greater Providence area. “It was very obvious that people were really resistant to even talking,” Sierra said. “But it’s so important that (conversations) happen,” she added. Spring related how Express Your Psych’s safe space allowed for people like her, who had not planned to perform, to share their stories.</p>
<p class="p2">More events like Express Your Psych are in the works. “We’ll definitely have more open mics and more art galleries, and we want to end up selling our art to fundraise and also enable people to see what is being produced by members of our group,” Spring said.“We’re really hoping to make a positive and substantial change in the way mental illness is viewed.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Artist decodes studio, curatorial work</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">At 5 p.m. Wednesday, members of the Providence community gathered in List Art Building 120 to hear Yevgeniya Baras discuss her experiences as a studio artist and a curator. Originally from Russia, Baras immigrated to the United States in her youth and is currently based in Brooklyn. She teaches art at both the Rhode Island School of Design and Sarah Lawrence College.</p>
<p class="p2">The talk began with Baras discussing her career as a studio artist and exploring the way both her Russian roots and her life in the United States have influenced her work. “I (want) my paintings to be bilingual,’” Baras said as she described her usage of text and symbols to depict her personal experiences. “Sometimes it’s a single word in a different language that I speak, sometimes it’s an acronym that I made up, sometimes it’s a combination of different languages … I like to play with letters as a way to make form. They give the painting structure and it’s another way to imbue the painting with meaning,” she explained.</p>
<p class="p2">While Baras makes a conscious effort to be aware of where the symbology originates, it occasionally feels like the symbols in her work are just “floating in the ether,” she said. “My paintings are often said to be encoded,” she added. “They’re like closed universes.” However, despite the esoteric nature of some of her artwork, Baras feels closely connected to her art. “I work on 20 to 30 paintings at once,” she said. “It’s like being a part of a big family with kids.”</p>
<p class="p2">“I really liked the way (Baras) plays with media,” said Josh Cabello ’19, referring to Baras’ unique incorporation of materials in her artwork. “Sometimes I find materials and sometimes people who are important to me give me materials and I embed them in my work,” Baras explained. For instance, when Baras’ friend was immigrating from the United States, she gave Baras her curtains, which Baras proceeded to insert in one of her paintings to “function as the frame.”</p>
<p class="p2">In addition to her work as a studio artist, Baras also spoke of her role as a curator. In 2010, she co-founded and was a co-curator at Regina Rex Gallery in New York, alongside a group of other artists. Being a curator allowed Baras to interact with different artists and understand more about “other artists’ lives.”</p>
<p class="p2">The job of a curator is to pair different kinds of artists together and re-contextualize their work, Baras said. In that sense, it parallels the work of artists. “I began to feel like my studio is my practice and the gallery is just a different branch of my practice,” she explained. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p2">“I think it’s really important to look at the types of artists that have a dual role in the community,” said Kristine Newson, the academic program manager for the Visual Art Department. Baras “is both curatorial and an artist, so she can provide that dual perspective of what it’s like to see art in the real world in relation to other art being created, as well as taking inspiration from around her and making (art),” she said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Improving childhood literacy rates is a daunting task, but recent Brown alum and entrepreneur Gwendolene Mugodi ’18 has already taken steps to address this problem in her first children’s book, “Greedy Gari.” Mugodi published her project in two languages, English and Shona — one of Zimbabwe’s 15 indigenous languages. While at Brown, Mugodi collaborated with her friend Kelechukwu Udozorh ’18 to start Toreva Books— a nonprofit publishing press committed to releasing books that feature and engage with a myriad of African characters.</p>
<p class="p2">According to Mugodi, “Greedy Gari,” which became available for preorder this summer, details the life of a young boy with a tremendous love of food and the adventures he has at a wedding. “Some of Gari’s characteristics in the book were also cherry-picked from my own childhood, but I won’t say which,” Mugodi said. Currently, only those who ordered the book during its July presale have received copies, Mugodi said. But copies of the book are now available in the Brown Bookstore as well as on Toreva’s website. This November, Toreva will officially launch the book for purchase in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="p2">As a young girl growing up in Zimbabwe, Mugodi hadn’t read any books that reflected her cultural and racial heritage. After she read “Purple Hibiscus” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in the eleventh grade, “there was an awakening to the magic of seeing someone like yourself in a book,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mugodi said.</p>
<p class="p2">When Mugodi returned to Zimbabwe after her first year at Brown, she became aware that 70 percent<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of Zimbabwean children who enter a first-grade classroom exclusively speak one of the indigenous languages at home. Because the education system assumes that students know English, this literacy gap places many students at a disadvantage, according to Toreva’s website. The nonprofit aims to solve this problem by publishing children’s books in all of Zimbabwe’s native languages and in English.</p>
<p class="p2">To support her entrepreneurship, Mugodi received a Swearer Center for Public Service Fellowship as well as support from the Heimark Fund and the Brown International Scholarship Committee. Mugodi also attended the Breakthrough Lab, a rigorous eight-week accelerator intended to support students developing entrepreneurial projects. “Brown allowed me to grow this idea from a dream to reality,” Mugodi said.</p>
<p class="p2">Jason Harry, director of B-Lab and professor of the practice of engineering, noted that Toreva is an example of entrepreneurship that goes against the stereotype that resigns startups to technological focuses. “We’re looking for ventures that have impact at scale and address a significant unmet need,” Harry said. According to Harry, Toreva’s solutions to this “unmet need” include improving children’s literacy in indigenous languages, in part to prepare them for learning a new language.</p>
<p class="p2">Both Harry and Mugodi reflected on the progress made during their summer at the B-Lab — a fully configured website, Toreva’s first book and sales. “B-Lab gave us valuable time, a working space and the mentorship we needed to actualize a lot of our goals,” Mugodi said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Thursday, the McCormack Family Theatre was home to author Chris Kraus as she shared excerpts out of her latest book, “After Kathy Acker,” a biography about punk poet and sex-positive feminist writer Kathy Acker, who found fame in the 1970s before fading from the limelight.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kraus was invited to speak on campus as a guest for the Writers on Writing Reading Series hosted by the Literary Arts department.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although born in New York City, Kraus spent her childhood in Connecticut and New Zealand. Graduating with a Bachelor of Arts from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, she worked as a journalist for five years before returning to the United States. Kraus, who is most notably the author of novels such as “I Love Dick,” “Aliens and Anorexia,” “Torpor” and “Summer of Hate,” has also dabbled in other artistic ventures, such as films and staged performances.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While her earlier work was more performance-based, Kraus made the transition to writing full-time with her exemplary novel “I Love Dick” in 1997. Kraus really only began writing “in (her) late 30s, and the book didn’t come out until (she) was 40,” Kraus explained. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “I Love Dick” has been taught in ENGL 1710R: “Recent Experiments in American Fiction,” an upper-level class taught by Timothy Bewes, a professor in the English department. Kraus’s book “really formed the premium text for everyone,” Bewes said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kraus’ latest work centers around the life of postmodern literary icon Kathy Acker. After a student questioned the blend of fiction and nonfiction in her work, Kraus explained that her writing is often a mixture of the authentic and factual. She used a lot of material found in external archives and would “sometimes … import stuff from (Acker’s) diary,” which would contain personal bias and perspective, she said. For instance, Kraus looked at Acker’s correspondences and personal notes on her own work, which were found in literary archives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kraus also discussed her own personal relationship with Acker. “She was my absolute idol,” Kraus said, adding that learning of Acker’s death “just broke my heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the talk, an audience member asked Kraus to comment on a recent blog post, in which she took a controversial stance on the 2017 Title IX investigation brought by Nimrod Reitman, a former New York University graduate student, against his doctoral advisor Professor of German and Comparative Literature Avital Ronell, who was found guilty of sexual harassment in 2018 by an NYU investigation and is on leave for the academic year. In her Aug. 19 blog post, Kraus took the defense of Ronell, citing Reitman’s “accusations couched in the disingenuous sentiments of #MeToo,” she wrote.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Reitman — or any Ph.D. student at NYU — is hardly an innocent,” Kraus further wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the event, Kraus responded that she “would not have (initially) gotten involved. … It was after Nimrod Reitman brought a lawsuit against Avital — a multimillion-dollar lawsuit — and he’s already a wealthy person with a legal team of seven lawyers, and she has no personal wealth. She is 66 years old. That just seemed so excessive.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I guess I wrote (the blog post) more from an emotional place than a logical place,” she added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Everett Company’s ‘Good Grief’ grapples with physical, emotional trauma</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thursday evening, a bustling audience gathered in the Granoff Center for Creative Arts to see Everett Company’s “Good Grief” — a multimedia performance centered around trauma’s grip on both mind and body. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The audience faced a stage cast in a cool, blue light, growing silent as members of the Everett Company began to emerge from behind a projection screen, their shadows and vague features visible among rolling ocean waves. Bells tolled in the distance while the artists swayed back and forth in composed movements, giving a sense of unity between their bodies and minds. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The artists used both dance and pantomime to convey their life experiences. Dressed in various costumes, the artists employed dioramas, projected videos and used a variety of music to enact particular scenes, all of which were charged with physical and emotional intensity. Scenes ranged from conversations with an assumed therapist in a suburban living room to a depiction of a ghost-like figure trudging through a forest with literal baggage. Artists cycled through various identities, using masks, dresses, cloaks and even shadows to portray family members, emotions and stages in their lives, providing a fully immersive experience for both themselves and the audience.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The physical toll of trauma was emphasized throughout the play. During dance, Everett Company’s artists provided dialogue on the nature of trauma and its physical effects on the mind and the body. Bodies became fluid as the artists leaned against, pushed and supported each other. At times, artists even grappled with “parts” of themselves, engaging in dialogue with their insecurities and trauma. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Throughout the performance, artists visualized this dialogue with their “parts,” a method highlighted in Internal Family Systems, a psychotheraputic model. IFS emphasizes conflicts between “subpersonalities,” according to the Center for Self Leadership, an organization that focuses on the IFS method. At one point, with the use of a projected video, an artist began a conversation with one of their “parts,” their insecurity. At first, the dialogue was angry, aggressive and resentful, but once the artist began approaching their part with kinder words, a sense of familiarity began to settle over the two. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Good Grief” showed how trauma of all kinds can be a visceral experience, taking over an individual physically and cognitively, while also evidencing how the artists could begin healing and recognizing their trauma by confronting it with the IFS method, dance and theater. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the final dancing act and a standing ovation, Everett Company opened up the stage for a question-and-answer opportunity. Attendees lauded the theater troupe for their talent, skill and emotional vulnerability in presenting their story. When asked about the process of developing the theme of “Good Grief,” one of the artists replied that trauma was a focus for the performance. “We’ve been doing a lot of work in high schools,” they said. “All these artists have been going into middle schools and working with clinicians and creating artistic adaptations to clinical programs and group therapy for students who have been identified with suffering from PTSD.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The artists emphasized how significant IFS therapy was to the overall performance. They all met a therapist who specialized in IFS, and one of the members of Everett Company elaborated: “You’d go in and find a part of yourself you’d want to talk to, and talk to that part, and then we played each other’s parts; we brought in movement. … Those were some of the ways we created some of the material.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Leeds Theatre’s production of “Bulrusher,” race, family and forgiveness are seen through the eyes of an earnest and confused young woman as she struggles to discover herself. The coming-of-age play was written by Eisa Davis and is directed by Sarah dAngelo, assistant professor of theatre arts and performance studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although clumsy lines and unnecessary plot points sometimes get in the way, passionate performances by the student actors coupled with powerful characters and captivating webs of language ultimately render “Bulrusher” a convincing and engaging show. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The play centers on 18-year-old Bulrusher, so named because she was found as a baby in the bulrushes of the Navarro river in California. Bulrusher, played by Keanna Hunter ’21, was raised by the town’s schoolteacher, known as Schoolch (Robert Capron ’20).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bulrusher feels out of place, accentuated by her ability to foresee a person’s future when touching water with which they have had contact, causing the town to label her a witch. The story revolves around her interactions with other members of the town: Madam (Paola Jiménez ’20), who runs a brothel, Logger (Lemuel Burgos ’20), the only African-American in the town besides Bulrusher and Boy (Sam Masto ’21), who harasses Bulrusher into being his girlfriend. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Living in Boonville, California in 1955, the characters don’t seem to experience any racial tension, despite the violence across the country, and Bulrusher is unaware of the broader implications of her racial identity until the arrival of Vera (Alonnie Johnson ’21), Logger’s niece, from Alabama. Vera and Bulrusher immediately experience a deep affection for each other, and Bulrusher feels that she has finally met someone like her, calling Vera a mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not everyone is thrilled with their relationship, however, and the revelations that come to light force Bulrusher to deal with hatred and love as she endeavors to find a family. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Water is ubiquitous in the play, from the constant mention of the Navarro river to Bulrusher’s ability to “read water,” to the set itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The river is central to the backdrop, and everything seems to revolve around it. The lighting is often blue and green, while the musical interludes provide a lyrical and flowing effect.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Along with water, the play is obsessed with language, with most of the characters speaking in a dialect particular to Boonville. While the intricacies of language often add beauty to the scenes, they also add a strained element to viewing the performance. When Bulrusher visits the Navarro river, she speaks to it in free verse poetry, and though Hunter valiantly attempts to inject integrity into these lines, Bulrusher’s monologues at the river often feel contrived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Equally awkward are Schoolch’s lines, or more appropriately, lack of lines. The character often doesn’t speak, resulting in odd pauses that seem unnecessary. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nonetheless, the moments when language disappoints in “Bulrusher” are far outweighed by the moments when language brilliantly drives the story. In an emotional scene between Bulrusher and Schoolch, Bulrusher asks him if she has ever had another name. Schoolch tells her that their names are their fates and they are bound by them, saying, “Once you had another name, but I forget it now. You’re a Bulrusher to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Bulrusher” will run until Oct. 7. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Very rarely does an artist release a 20-plus-song album that is highly enjoyable front to back — no filler and no frills. Chicago-based rapper Lupe Fiasco’s seventh studio album, “Drogas Wave,” a 98-minute, 24-track firebrand that dropped Sept. 21, provides an expansive and rich utopian re-imagining of human suffering, both domestically and abroad. Following its lackluster precursor, “Drogas Light,” “Drogas Wave” is filled with the dense lyricism, vivid portraiture, nuanced social commentary and “extracurricular listening” that has defined Lupe’s critical success. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It has been 13 years since Lupe skyrocketed into the hip hop limelight conferred to him by his feature on Kanye West’s “Touch The Sky.” After his initial ascent, he quickly dropped two veritable classics —2006’s “Food &amp; Liquor” and 2007’s “The Cool” — but has since failed to replicate his rare achievement of both mainstream and critical success. Though his 2015 album, “Tetsuo and Youth,” proved to be an indelible assortment of abstract wordplay, the three other albums he has put out are contrived. This may be due in part to Lupe’s constant conflict with his label, Atlantic Records, which has continuously blocked Lupe from releasing the music he has wanted to release: “I will never ever ever … give this label my heart,” Lupe said at a concert. Now that his contractual obligations have been seen through, “Drogas Wave” marks a moment that exhibits Lupe at his independent, unhindered best. Conceptually, the album initially revolves around an image of sick and dying enslaved people who were thrown overboard while being shipped from Africa to the West Indies. Lupe reimagines the enslaved as “long chains,” or underwater-dwelling humans who spend their lives sinking slave ships. This tale then transitions into other themes like gang violence, drugs, self-help and community empowerment, which eventually coalesce into Lupe’s hope for a future unconstrained by nauseating realities. Lupe’s now-signature use of acronyms and obscure references submerge these ideas and their connecting strands in a certain opacity to create a slowly digestible work that requires multiple listens.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The album’s first few tracks highlight Lupe’s thematic and linguistic creativity and set up a cinematic montage that eventually propels listeners into the present. In “Manilla,” the album’s furious anthem, Lupe raises up the Manilla, a West African currency used in the slave trade, as a dehumanizing symbol of enslaved people. “Don’t ruin us, don’t ruin us, don’t ruin us, God said,” Lupe sings, using the D.R.U.G.S. acronym to trace a continuous line of commodification that extends from historical enslavement to contemporary mass incarceration. In “WAV Files,” as the title suggests, Lupe raps smoothly on a laid back beat and riffs off entendre after entendre on topics like Davy Jones, Poseidon and Jay Z’s Tidal, while simultaneously painting a picture of “walkin’ on water ‘til my feet like Jesus Christ.” Lupe does not limit himself to rapping in American English but also speaks in Spanish in “Drogas” and assumes a faux-Patois in “Gold vs the Right Things to Do.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Interludes are common in long albums, but only Lupe could include something like the “Slave Ship - Interlude,” a three-and-half minute violin solo which comes in after the fourth track. Rosy Timms, the soloist, intersperses slow melancholic melodies with dissonant thrashes between low and high octaves and creates a spiritually overflowing elegy that elevates the album to a lyrical-transcendet plane. The piece recalls Krzysztof Penderecki’s 1960 “Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima,” a work composed for a 52-piece string ensemble that attempts to shape ineffable suffering into sheet music, and only further highlights Lupe’s expansive imagining of how close music can come to doing history justice. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Taken with the idea of drawing as close as possible to the core of human suffering and then reimagining it with hope and grace, Lupe drops the theme of sea dwellers to ruminate on contemporary and individual loss and despair: In “Jonylah Forever” and “Alan Forever” Lupe beautifully elegizes Jonylah Watkins, a six-month-old killed in Chicago gang violence, and Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned off the coast of Turkey. However, in Lupe’s utopian world, Jonylah is “accepted by every medical school you applied” and afterwards returns to her neighborhood where she creates a “free clinic, nobody denied,” saving gang violence victims. Alan Kurdi becomes a world class swimmer, nicknamed “the lifeguard,” who eventually rescues a drowning boy from the sea. Both end up in similar positions, taking what literally killed them and using it as their source of strength: “Bet you ain’t even know you saved yourself,” Lupe says, leaving listeners a cryptic message that may point to the breaking of the cyclical chains of violence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With 24 tracks in “Drogas,” there are bound to be some disappointing cuts, and there are, like the song “Down,” where Lupe veers into (hilariously) corny aquatic rap, saying “fish is my friends and the whales is my homies / octopuses my people, the shrimp, they all know me.” The song “XO” sticks out as pop-rap-EDM residue reminiscent of “Lasers”: “You and me, ecstasy (X-X O),” Troi Irons sings in the chorus. However, these tracks are by no means objectively bad and fail to disrupt overall flow of the album, which is disproportionately filled with catchy and nuanced melodies, classic instrumentals and a lyrical effort only matched by a handful of contemporary artists. Even in just the album title, “Drogas,” or drugs in Spanish, several meanings can be ascertained. It may point listeners to the flooding of drugs onto the streets. The “wave” may refer to a washing over, both in a life-giving and life-destroying force. Or, simply, it may refer to being “dope” and “wavy.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In “Manilla,” Lupe raps, “you can do anything if you survive blackness” and possibly distills the spirit of the album to a single line. It is out of this conviction that Lupe and his art operates: his belief that, though racial oppression is a battle far from won, glimmers of hope can be thawed out from history’s dark abysses. It is also out of this conviction that Lupe gives listeners all of himself in his music — Japanese video games, circuit laws and ancient Greek poetry somehow tie into Lupe’s self-aware, braggadocio claims (“fit the life of a whole booth in only half a line”). At this point in Lupe’s career, it is abundantly clear that he will never back down from the esoteric references, difficult-to-parse connections and straight bars that makes his music so frustrating, yet so great.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last week, the Center for Language Studies’ “Foreign Flicks” series screened “In the Mood for Love,” an atypical Chinese drama-romance whose brazen, erotic commitment to traditionalism prompts audiences to reconsider the role fidelity plays in modern love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Written and directed by renowned Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai, the film captures the thwarted love of Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung), two young professionals who move with their respective spouses into the same apartment building in Hong Kong. Both quiet, introspective and impeccably dressed, their relationship intensifies from one of casual friendship to co-dependency after they discover that their spouses — both thought to have been on “business trips” — are having an affair abroad. They ultimately fall for each other but refuse to act on their feelings on principle, not wanting to be like their unfaithful spouses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The film was universally adored by critics upon its release in 2000, with Elvis Mitchell of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/30/movies/film-festival-review-just-next-door-neighbors-till-love-breaches-walls.html">New York Times</a> going so far as to dub it “the most breathtakingly gorgeous film of the year.” It was most lauded for its bold stylistic composition — the ornate visuals and rhythmic slow-motion sequences that succeed in making the lovers’ repressed desire intensely palpable. There remains a certain ceremony to the film that is often lost on modern love stories, as instanced by the scene in which the elegant Su walks out in an elaborate cocktail dress, her swaying hips scored by a string orchestra. Similarly evocative are the scenes that emphasize the gravity of the neighbors’ in-passing encounters — exchanging pleasantries on the stairwell is scored as though it is a dance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another tactful choice employed by Wong is to never fully display the couples together on-screen — each character only hears their correspondent partner on the other end of the phone or from behind a door saying things like “I’ll be home late tonight.” Not exclusive to the couples, the dialogue between each of them is consistently sparse and cryptic: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Bring two handbags for my boss,” says Su to her husband before he departs for Japan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Why?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You know why.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wong uses these brief exchanges to reinforce the stoicism of the neighbors’ unorthodox relationship and contrast it starkly against the ostensibly “principled” world they live in. Wong artfully demonstrates hierarchical principles that govern social interaction through scenes that depict neighbors and co-workers practicing rehearsed-sounding politeness and humility. But it is also a world steeped in tacit understandings, which is established early on, when Chow repeats, “I’m not like you,” to his brothel-frequenting best friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tension between the two worlds leaves the filmic lovers, friends and ambiguously related individuals suspended in a fascinatingly erotic, ambiguous limbo. Are they touching behind closed doors? You can’t be certain. The ball drops when their spouses return. Chow moves to Shanghai, Su has a child, and their lives go on as planned. Neither Chow nor Su divorce their spouses, but they continue to pine for each other in silence. The movie ends with a powerful scene of longing: Chow whispering about his love for Su into a hole in the wall of an ancient ruin. Presumably years after Chow is long gone, the camera pans through the ruin, eventually settling<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>on the hole, which has vines growing from it. Not all is lost, the vines communicate, and the screen goes dark. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Multidisciplinary artist Shaun Leonardo and Christina Yang, director of public programs at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, drew a crowd of students and faculty to the Martinos Auditorium in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts last night for a conversation about Leonardo’s work and his recent performance at the museum. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heather Bhandari, adjunct professor of visual arts, introduced Leonardo “as an exceptional artist, a social activist and an extraordinary educator,” as well as “a powerful disrupter and change agent.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leonardo is based in Brooklyn, New York. He received his Master of Fine Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute and has received support from Creative Capital and the Guggenheim Social Practice initiative. As a testament to his dedication to social practice, Leonardo co-founded Assembly, a program that invites youth aged 16 to 24 who have been arrested to join Leonardo in a storytelling and performance workshop as an alternative to having their cases pursued in court. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Shaun and I are excited to present a view of what it takes to sustain a social practice within the life of an artist and also within the confines of a museum,” Yang said. “These are particularly divisive times in the United States, and Shaun is a unique artist working across many worlds, encompassing the visual arts, masculinity, performance, black and brown identities, failure and the law,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Leonardo began by giving an overview of “Primitive Games,” the piece he recently exhibited at the Guggenheim. The piece involved the coalescing of four distinct groups: members of the New York Police Department, military veterans, recreational users of firearms and citizens impacted by street violence. After four months of negotiations and workshops, the groups came together in the Guggenheim’s rotunda — which had been transformed into a gladiatorial arena — to debate through voiceless movement. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The groups were not privy to the identities of the other groups at any point throughout the workshops and were not made aware of the central issue of debate until the performance. “They could not perceive who was on the other side of that argument until they were faced with that person,” Leonardo said. This avoided the creation of talking points, which often cause communication to fail before it has been initiated, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The argument that I’m posing here is that what interrupts or completely defeats interconnectivity is the fact that language is the very thing that gets in the way,” Leonardo said. The performance removed the possibility for the groups to fall back on defensive language, he explained, forcing them to rely on the embedded choreography unique to each identity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To transport a slice of the exhibit, Leonardo asked the Granoff audience to stand and participate in an exercise used in “Primitive Games.” Posing questions such as “Do you think you will be alive in ten years?” and “Have you ever held a bullet?,” he asked each audience member to respond by rotating their body a quarter-turn in either direction. The audience shifted, with people ending up in opposition, isolated or facing one another, depending on each person’s private responses. At the Guggenheim performance, this exercise was used to break the individuals of the four groups into two sides — revealing connections across group identities. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This was only a taste of the exercises that Leonardo introduced to students in a workshop held earlier Wednesday, which asked students to investigate whether debate could be played out through movement — like it had in “Primitive Games.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Leonardo focuses on embodiment — taking on roles, characters, emotions — in many of his works. To do this, he has trained and become a “Mexican wrestler, a boxer, a mixed martial artist, a bullfighter,” he said. “So it was always important to me that in this embodiment … I was critiquing from the inside, out.” He began to involve other players in his performance pieces over time, moving away from a focus on the self, as he investigated masculinity, violence and community. One piece — “Bull in the Ring” — enacted a now-banned football drill of the same name, which required one player to enter a circle formed by his teammates and play the part of a matador, as another charged toward him like the bull. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m consistently — and particularly these days — trying to find approaches and strategies for moving individuals and communities closer together,” Leonardo said, speaking to his work as an artist and a social activist. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As program director at the Guggenheim, Yang facilitated the realization of Leonardo’s work in the museum, “where it not only held the space, but … imbued the institution with risk-taking, vulnerability and strength in a way that transformed our conception of what kinds of conversations could happen within the often conventional walls of a museum,” Bhandari said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Yves Tumor releases Warp Records debut</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Italy-based artist Sean Bowie, more famously known as Yves Tumor, released his new album “Safe in the Hands of Love” to Warp Records Sept. 5, demonstrating his ability to unravel everything that we consider to be “experimental music.”</p>
<p class="p4">It is important to know that Yves Tumor remains a reticent figure — there are few interviews, pictures or articles on his personal life or identity. The only video of him that most listeners are familiar with is footage of him wailing, splayed out on a pile of dirt at a fashion show. Yves’ new album again puts aside personal identity for artistic expression.</p>
<p class="p4">“Safe in the Hands of Love” is an album that recalls a lot of things: artists like Ariel Pink, Arca, Sunn O))), Jodeci, Morrissey; a diary; and the feeling of being trapped in an alternate dimension. What is so captivating about Yves Tumor’s new album is that it perhaps intends to evoke a multiplicity of aesthetics. It challenges our definitions of experimental music by suggesting that it doesn’t have to be so unfamiliar. It shouldn’t be categorized into a binary either/or (sorry, Elliott Smith); rather, it should be experienced.</p>
<p class="p4">Yves’ new album is as enchanting as it is haunting — it equally revels in both the oddly catchy lyrics of tracks like “Noid” and the abrasive, expansive rush of noises in “Licking an Orchid.” Yves Tumor shows himself to be a musician that can beguile us with auditory forms of anxiety and melancholy while simultaneously calling upon feelings of longing and anticipation. And this duality in composition and emotion is meant to tell us something.</p>
<p class="p4">Throughout the album, Yves Tumor maintains an undercurrent of intensity, both emotionally and musically. The ’90s-esque, running back-beat and stringed instrumentals of “Noid” are redefined by Yves’ dark, anxious lyrics: “Sister, mother, brother, father / Have you, have you looked outside? / I’m scared for my life / They don’t trust us / I’m not part of the killing spree / A symptom, born loser, statistic.” This line is repeated, and the surprisingly accessible vocals (more palpable than those exhibited in previous albums) threaten a regular Yves fan’s drawn distance between mainstream elements and experimentation. The ironic simplicity of some tracks’ moments doubled with interludes of searing, noisy complexity invites us to reconsider what we call Yves Tumor. Yes, Yves delves into plunderphonics, noise music and post-industrial sounds, but should we be so eager to pigeonhole “Safe in the Hands of Love” as “experimental” and subsequently conflate “experimental” with “good”?</p>
<p class="p4">“Safe in the Hands of Love” composes a phantasmagoria of sound and lyrics at once familiar and unfamiliar. Yves Tumor condenses a myriad of tones and sounds into one album and forces us to listen from another angle. It suggests that maybe all artists should foray into the realm of “experimental,” or perhaps, it hints that the audience should all dive into an experimental sort of listening. The album can have the label of “experimental” taped onto it, but by subversively darting between different genres of sounds and noises, Yves Tumor refuses to be pinned down to one type of narrative, audience and crux.</p>
<p class="p4">“Safe in the Hands of Love” urges listeners to consider what it means to listen to music. It’s easy to categorize certain genres with certain people: “Beach Goth” with jumpsuit-clad art kids with literal clown makeup, Canterbury scene with millennial-aged men and plunderphonics with crate-digging, list-obsessed “Rate Your Music” users. Yves acknowledges this, and his album tears up its label, insisting that we instead take his narrative of sound for what it is: music.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Florence and the Machine’s new album gives raw account of healing</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Florence and the Machine’s “High as Hope” is an invitation to come closer. This latest album is intimate, raw and unapologetically human. Florence Welch stays true to herself and her previous work: Her haunting voice, dramatic instrumentals and spiritual motifs are reminiscent of past albums. At the same time, her newest work is both stripped down and eruptive. As part of the album tour, Florence and the Machine will be performing in Boston this Friday, Oct. 12.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The album opens with “June,” which features a slow vocal and instrumental buildup. Lyrically, it is a deliberately repetitive opening track. The chorus can be read as an imperative, as it contains only the repeated line: “Hold on to each other.” This is summative of the album, which forms a lyrical journey of healing as listeners are invited to come along. </span></p>
<p class="p2">But just as life has its ups and downs, love and healing are not without their own tensions and uncertainties. The song ends with a low, as she chants, “I’m so high, I’m so high / I can see an angel.” Welch, now two years sober, alludes both to the “high” of love and to her own issues with substance abuse. “Hunger” sounds more upbeat; Welch sings of the ways in which she has tried to satiate an insatiable hunger. She speaks frankly of her overuse of drugs and performance to reach fulfillment. Not everyone suffers from the same issues of excess of which Welch sings. But her lyrics bring to the surface a hunger, a longing, that we can all relate to: “We never found the answer / But we knew one thing / We all have a hunger.” The emotional zenith of Welch’s troubles and musical output might be “Sky Full of Song,” a traumatic and ballad-like acknowledgment of how difficult it is to achieve catharsis and growth. “I thought I was flying / But maybe I’m dying tonight,” she sings.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The album transitions into a much-needed sense of redemption in its second half, however. “Grace” is at once an apology and an ode to the importance of familial relations. The song is addressed to Grace, Welch’s sister, and its lyrics carry poignant double meanings. “Grace, I don’t say it enough,” can be both an apology to a sister named Grace, and a statement about our lack of gratitude and not saying our graces. She sings of her faith in her sister’s love and of her desire for redemption: “This is the only thing I’ve ever had any faith in / Tell me what I can do, I will make it up to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the album’s entire musical landscape, seemingly incongruent strands of pain and loss come together to lyrically display the complexity of human life. It draws us to what we must wash away, and the kind of love that must end for open and honest love to begin. Welch concludes the album on a melancholic and deeply hopeful note, as she sings, “Things seem so unstable / But for a moment we were able to be still.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though musically simpler than previous albums, “High as Hope” conveys emotional depth in its lyrics. Welch touches upon love, loss and redemption in this intimate look at her own life and relationships. Healing is difficult, and there are always lows — but the repeated lyrical motif in “Patricia” seems to hold true: “It’s such a wonderful thing to love.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This Saturday, the Main Green will once again become music festival stomping grounds­­ — this year’s edition of Gigs on the Grass will be taking place on the campus’ largest quad. The third annual day-long festival celebrates student performances from a wide range of musical styles, complemented by food trucks and art. Gigs on the Grass is presented by the Brown University Class Coordinating Board and the Brown Concert Agency.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Organized by Melissa Lee ’20, community outreach officer of the 2020 CCB, and Marisa Kouroubacalis ’19.5, president of the 2019 CCB, Gigs on the Grass will present 14 student acts throughout the day, including solo acoustic performers, DJs and bands. Lee and Kouroubacalis hosted auditions for 60 individuals and groups for the event before selecting nine musical groups and five solo performers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gigs on the Grass is the brainchild of Pia Struzzieri ’18, Kouroubacalis explained. When brainstorming events for CCB, Struzzieri’s housemate expressed frustration about the lack of on-campus events for student bands. “She kind of created the idea based on that, so she started the event two years ago and (she ran) it entirely by herself” until she graduated, Kouroubacalis said. Struzzieri graduated last May but continued to help with the production of Gigs on the Grass this year by offering her references, notes and guidance through FaceTime calls. “It’s set up to be at Brown forever because of all the amazing work that she did,” Kouroubacalis said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the past, Gigs on the Grass engaged crowds on smaller fields, beginning on Pembroke Field in 2016 and moving to Wriston Quadrangle in 2017. It was originally structured as a battle-of-the-bands with two opposing stages facing each other, Kouroubacalis said. This year, the event is moving to its largest venue yet — the Green — with only one large stage, as Lee and Kouroubacalis decided to remove the battle aspect. “We didn’t want it to be like a competitive thing where someone walks away winning,” Kouroubacalis said, continuing, “we just wanted to showcase the talent.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We didn’t have any<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(particular) musical theme in mind per se. We just wanted to create a cohesive lineup that showcases Brown’s musicians,” Lee said, emphasizing they considered what the student population would enjoy in making their selections.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bree Zhang ’22 will be performing solo on the guzheng, a twenty-one-stringed Chinese harp. “Since I was young I’ve been trying to perform to spread the culture of the instrument so that more people can know about it and more people can appreciate the history that comes with (this) instrument,” she said. She will be performing three songs, including an original composition and a lyrical, traditional piece titled “Spring Comes to the Snowy Mountain.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think that it’s important for events to show off any sort of talent. It doesn’t have to be just music, … but whatever kind of capabilities we have at Brown,” Zhang said, adding that the range of talent at the festival should reflect the diversity found at Brown. “It kind of brings us together,” Zhang said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Haley Barthel ’20, another individual performer, will be showcasing her soft pop sounds on Saturday. “I’ve always liked singing and playing guitar, but … I kind of just do it for fun, and so it seemed like a cool opportunity to put myself out there and perform,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gigs on the Grass will “really (be) an event for the students from the students, … so we hope that everyone comes out and enjoys it,” Lee said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">English indie band Slowdive celebrates the 25th anniversary of their seminal 1993 LP “Souvlaki” this year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The shoegaze project — comprising Rachel Goswel, Neil Halstead, Simon Scott, Nick Chaplin and Christian Savill — released “Souvlaki” on the coattails of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>their 1991 debut “Just For a Day,” which only anticipated the autumnal, leveling sonics of “Souvlaki” that have since become indelibly embedded in listeners’ minds and shoegaze bands’ soundscapes. Twenty-five years later, the album still dreamily haunts audiences.</p>
<p class="p4">It’s difficult to not praise Slowdive’s ability to weave narcotic compositions of droning guitar riffs, far away vocals and swirling melodies. In the dreamy realm of shoegaze, what canonical band My Bloody Valentine bleeds, Slowdive melts and evaporates. Rachel Goswell’s hazy, drifting vocals layering on top of Neil Halstead’s drowned voice in “40 Days” envelops the audience in the midst of sweeping guitar reverb. And in “Alison,” the album’s opening track, Slowdive instills in listeners a sense of evanescent beauty and simultaneous loss with introspective, wavering lyrics and noise: Halstead somberly sings “Alison, I said we’re sinking / But you laugh and tell me it’s just fine / I guess she’s out there somewhere.” These escapist words and sounds are enough to enchant any weepy, angst-ridden teenager looking out the window on public transportation<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— it’s just a fact.</p>
<p class="p4">And despite the album’s penchant to charm indie kids all over the world, “Souvlaki” is still considered the crown jewel and bastion of the dream-pop, shoegaze genre by any music fan or critic. Inspired by David Bowie’s “Low,” Aphex Twin and Joy Division, and partially produced by musical legend Brian Eno, Slowdive’s second release is deeply beloved for its timeless quality, which evokes the universality of pure, unadultered emotion. Magazines and publications like Pitchfork, Paste and AllMusic now unequivocally name “Souvlaki” as a definitive statement in music — not just shoegaze, but history.</p>
<p class="p4">But “Souvlaki” was not always well received by critics. This initial pushback — and subsequent critical reapprisal — are parts of the album’s history that are<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>deeply ingrained into the album’s legacy and mythos. Upon the album’s release in 1993, Melody Maker writer Dave Simpson commented, “I would rather drown choking in a bath full of porridge than ever listen to it again,” and Slowdive, as well as shoegaze broadly construed, failed to compete with American grunge and Britpop, leading to the band being dropped by their label in 1995 after their third release. In the 90s, Slowdive represented a foggy, lush voice in a sea of hook-and-melody, and they quickly fell out of the music scene after refusing to create a pop album.</p>
<p class="p4">Something happened, though, and Slowdive’s “Souvlaki” grew to become a superstar revival of 90s shoegaze. Featured in many retrospective reviews, the album quickly gained critical acclaim and a cult following, and it’s easy to understand why. As in most cases of critical reapprisal, the exact causes informing critics’ revised embrace of Slowdive remain indeterminate. The momentum generated by more positive revisionist reviews published after Slowdive’s breakup could simply be a product of capricious music reviewers, whose role is constantly guided by a certain arbitrariness. At any rate, it’s clear from YouTube lyrics videos collated by sixteen-year-olds with 90’s retroactive nostalgia that Slowdive has taken hold of the popular consciousness, with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>bands like M83, Deafheaven and countless others still echoing Slowdive’s dream-pop wall of sound.</p>
<p class="p4">One of the words most frequently associated with Slowdive is “dream,” as evidenced by the dream-pop genre commonly conflated with the band. There is something so unnatural, yet natural, in the band’s presentation of ethereal noise. “Souvlaki Space Station” is beautifully impressionistic in its experimental riffs and vague vocals; it flourishes and blossoms in a way that cannot be described except as “dream-like,” to the chagrin of critics who chastize the dream-pop’s genre’s lazy evasiveness. Tracks like “Dagger” and “When the Sun Hits” dually wield a dangerous sense of melodic optimism with soundscapes of melancholy, demonstrating Slowdive’s sinister yet celestial ability to concoct toppling atmospheres.</p>
<p class="p4">“Souvlaki” is the album upon a hill, blending a perfect combination of pop and shoegaze. Slowdive perfected shoegaze’s scope and capacity for pop sensitivity without the usual saccharine quality. It presents sound without edge, it’s hypnotic, it takes its time. Twenty-five years later, “Souvlaki” can continue to dizzy us in a sublime, lucid dream.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The John Hay Library held an open house for sophomores in the Lownes Room this past Friday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The room featured a variety of items drawn from the Hay’s major collections to showcase the manifold subject interests attended to by the library.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(We based) the display on items appraised on ‘Antiques Roadshow,’” said Ann Dodge, the reader services librarian. “We went through their archives (to see) what we have that they appraised. It turned out to be a beautiful cross-section of the collections.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Some of the items displayed at the open house include a daguerreotype of Edgar Allan Poe, early texts from the Church of Latter Day Saints, poems by Phillis Wheatley, selected comics and more. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There’s an absurd amount of wild stuff, like a color book; someone wanted a visual guide to every single color and you flip through and see the rainbow, which is so cool,” said Shira Buchsbaum ’19 who serves as the special collections assistant for the Harris Collection of American Poetry and Plays and is a former Herald reporter.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Hay opted to deliberately gear this open house toward sophomores.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“First-years at this time are still getting settled and aren’t necessarily thinking about long-term research projects in the future,” Buchsbaum said. “Juniors and seniors may have already taken up research, so sophomore year is a prime time to catch students who are already settled at Brown and may be looking for more academically-oriented projects but aren’t quite sure where to start.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Additionally, students who attended the Hay’s open house during Senior Week have expressed certain regret. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“One of the comments we always hear was ‘I wish I had known about all this cool stuff when I was still a student,’” Dodge said. “We’ve been trying to find ways to bring in more first-years and sophomores to get them to feel like the collections in the Hay are for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The items appeal to a broad range of interests. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m interested in conducting research at some point, and I thought it would be a good idea to familiarize myself with the objects that Brown has,” said Rohan Dalvi ’21. “I’m interested in history and find primary sources from past ages really interesting to look at.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As part of Family Weekend, the Hay is hosting an event similar to the open house Friday, Oct. 19 called “You Saw It on Antiques Roadshow,” which will run from 2 to 3:30 p.m. in the Lownes Room on the second floor. The Hay usually conducts an event for Family Weekend, and this year they plan to display selected comics that are also displayed on “Antiques Roadshow.” Six comics will be displayed, two from each of the following series: “Black Panther,” “X-Men” and “Icon.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“We are promoting these (comics) because they’re not only really interesting, but they’re promoting women of color,” said Jordan Jancosek, special collections survey librarian and curator for the comic book collection. “We are currently expanding the collection to include comics that are more representative of the world around us — more people of color, women, LGBTQ+ community, New England and Providence comics too.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The John Hay Comic Book Collection comprises roughly 60,000 comics and is free and open to the public. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If you’re interested in the material, there is definitely some unexpected stuff (at the Hay) and even if you’re not, then you might discover something that you find interesting,” Dalvi said. “It might lead you down some path, so it’s always good to explore new things.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The Hay is a really special place (though it) can come off as intimidating and imposing,” Buchsbaum said. “I really encourage students to come inside and request materials even if you aren’t necessarily pursuing a research project; anything you can think of, we probably have a book or game or figurine or something related to it, and you can request it and look at it and feel invigorated that Brown has access to it.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Hay maintains a variety of programming, complementing “You Saw It on Antiques Roadshow” with such exhibits as “The Poetry of Science: Dante’s Comedy and the Crafting of a Cosmos” and “The Brown Bear: A History” as well as “Blooming in the Noise of the Whirlwind: Women Poets from the Harris Collection,” which will open Oct. 22 and be on display at the Hay until Dec. 17.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Teju Cole, New York Times Magazine photography columnist and professor of the practice of creative writing at Harvard, spoke to an almost fully packed Salomon 101 Monday night. In the one-hour lecture, titled “Breaking Form,” Cole read excerpts and showed photographs from his book, “Blind Spot.” He also talked through some of his critiques from “On Photography,” his column at the New York Times Magazine.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cole acknowledged that his work crosses a variety of subjects, from art and photography to politics and writing. He first displayed “Blind Spot,” a photobook that shows “what words might have to say to pictures.” The book contains 150 photographs with texts that represent “voice overs” adjacent to the visual work, Cole said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Students and other members of the Providence community experienced the book visually and auditorily as he literally “voiced over” his photographs that were displayed in a slideshow. The texts varied in length, cadance and origin. For one photo, Cole hummed a song on stage and for another, he even inserted a line from poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He noted that in his writing process, he tries to find “three or four far-fetched things that have relationships with each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The title “Blind Spot” refers to when Cole had papillophlebitis — otherwise known as big blind spot syndrome—which obstructed his vision. The problem was fixed, but ever since, he said his photography has become calmer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After presenting on the book, Cole described his work as a photography critic. It takes Cole two weeks to write a critique, a process he labels as “exhausting.” He showed the audience various photographs he has reviewed, including one of a West African woman with a caption of “‘Je veux être seule,’’ meaning “I want to be alone” in English. In his review for the Times, he wrote that the caption suggests the woman “has decided her own image.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Santiago Wilson Heredia ’22 came to the talk because “as an aspiring writer, I was curious to see if I could learn something to help improve my own writing,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The talk was presented by The Department of Visual Art and supported by the Department of Africana Studies, Brown Arts Initiative, Cogut Institute for the Humanities, Department of History of Art and Architecture, Program in Literary Arts, Department of Modern Culture and Media and the Mollie D. Manneville Lectureship Fund, according to its Facebook page.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University panel discusses film “Crazy Rich Asians”</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The film “Crazy Rich Asians” has sparked discussions since its release. In efforts to create a space for open dialogue on how the film impacts and portrays both Asian American and wider Asian communities, the South East Asian Studies Initiative, Brown University Merlions, the East Asian Studies Departmental Undergraduate Group and Ethnic Studies DUG co-sponsored a panel and critical discussion forum held last Thursday in List Auditorium. Panelists included<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a selection of professors and graduate students.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The movie raised a lot of points of discussion for students and the public at large about the role of South East Asia, media images of Asians and (media portrayals of) Asian Americans,” said Quinton Huang ’19, senior advisor at SEASI and an organizer of the event. “It’s a very meaningful discussion for people to have.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Visiting Assistant Professor of East Asian Studies Ellie Choi opened the panel with a “postcolonial, transnational read” of the film and critiqued the work’s skewed portrayal of class. As the title suggests, “Crazy Rich Asians” generally depicts the “very, very wealthy,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Associate Professor of American Studies Robert Lee also commented on the film’s emphasis on wealth. There was a “vacuousness in the ostentatious abundance” portrayed in the movie, Lee said. He also brought up the issue of how the film’s genre should be perceived: “It’s not a documentary, not a drama. … It’s a basic rom-com,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a similar vein, graduate student panelist Mark Tseng-Putterman GS, a doctoral student in American Studies, said there were “impossible standards placed on ‘Crazy Rich Asians,’” especially with regard to representation, as there is more pressure for the film to be representative of the Asian American experience because of how rarely these stories are portrayed in Hollywood. “We feel deprived and must fight to tell our own stories,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“That pressure and that expectation have been partially generated by the marketing strategy of the film itself,” Tseng-Putterman said. He continued to criticize the formation of a “movement” around the film, and asked “what it means, in this moment of political crisis for so many immigrant and refugee communities, that the most visible Asian American movement has been to funnel money into the pockets of Warner Brothers.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ruby Thiagarajan GS, graduate student in Public Humanities, brought a Singaporean perspective to the panel. She said that the film resonated with Asian Americans’ “desire to see themselves as characters that can exist outside of their race.” She questioned why a movie about the Asian American experience had to be told in Asia. “Asian Americans exist in America, but it seems like the … entertainment industry doesn’t let them get past their Asianness,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> She brought up “the differences between thinking about Asian audiences and Asian American audiences,” and stated that her experience watching the movie in Singapore was very different than what it would have been watching it in the United States. She highlighted various “missteps” that take place during the film and focused on the issue of the “fabrication of Chineseness” in Singapore. Scenes like the folding of dumplings in the Young household and gambling in mah-jong parlours “would make sense to a Chinese-diasporic imagination, but is not really based on the reality of Singapore.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This depiction of Singapore raises questions about representation. “If this film is billed as a success for Asian representation in Hollywood, what does it mean if Asian representation means (only) Asian American representation?” Thiagarajan asked the audience. “Singapore joins a long list of countries that have been grossly misrepresented by Hollywood,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Audience questions both supported and challenged the opinions of the panelists. An audience member spoke about the lack of South and Southeast Asian representation in the movie. Despite the fact that Singapore is a multiethnic state, the film lacked ethnic diversity. “I’m a Singaporean Indian and Singapore is not completely Chinese,” Thiagarajan said in response to this point. “I do think that it’s an important question to ask. … The little Indian and South Asian representation you do get in the movie is incredibly racist,” she continued. Other questions posed by audience members grappled with racial representation, the biases of the media industry at large and the capitalist ideas embedded in the film’s narrative.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the event, attendees stayed after to ask questions, speak to the panelists and engage in conversations among themselves. “This discussion isn’t limited to this panel, but is something we will all continue,” Huang said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Huang hopes that more events like this will be held through the sponsoring DUGs and student initiatives. “Students want to have these discussions,” he said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New orchestra director talks background, future projects</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last May, the Department of Music announced that Mark Seto would serve as the new director of the Brown University Orchestra effective July 1. Prior to this appointment, Seto was an associate professor of music and director of the Connecticut College Orchestra.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He also holds the position of Artistic Director and Conductor of The Chelsea Symphony in New York City.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Herald: Let’s start with your musical background and experiences.</b></p>
<p class="p1">Seto: These days, I wear two hats in terms of what I do as a musician. I am a conductor, and I am also a musicologist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In terms of what I’m doing here at Brown, I’m directing the orchestra, but I’m also teaching academic courses. This semester, I’m teaching a course in Baroque and Classical music and next semester I’ll be teaching an introductory theory course.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>What attracted you to Brown?</b></p>
<p class="p1">I was really excited to have the opportunity to come here because I could wear both of those hats as a performer and also as a scholar and an academic. It’s weird to find that at an institution of Brown’s caliber because usually the bigger the institution is, the more specialized people get. Having the chance to do both was really special.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>How has your experience working with the orchestra been thus far?</b></p>
<p class="p1">It’s been fantastic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The musicians have all been really terrific, incredibly talented, intellectually curious — everything one could ask for.</p>
https://youtu.be/fSrWla1Lh08
<p class="p3"><b>What is the orchestra currently working on?</b></p>
<p class="p1">We’re getting ready for a concert coming up on Oct. 20 and Oct. 21. That program will feature two pieces of music: a piece called Sinfonía India by Carlos Chávez — an early 20th century Mexican composer — and Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 1. It’s a study in contrast because the pieces come out of very different cultural traditions, but what attracted me to the pairing was that both of the works juxtapose folklore and traditional elements with bracing modernity. They also have this incredible range of capturing human experience from the deepest sorrow to unbridled exuberance.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Last year the orchestra faced several challenges in terms of the conductor being relieved of his duties due to general dissatisfaction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have these disruptions affected you in any way?</b></p>
<p class="p1">I can’t speak directly to how things were prior to when I came here. What I can say is that there’s been a real sense of excitement of being able to start a new chapter in the orchestra’s history. We have an incredibly large and talented cohort of first year students. To be able to write this new chapter with a lot of students who are new to Brown is really exciting.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>What is your vision for the orchestra? </b></p>
<p class="p1">I think any orchestra, and particularly an orchestra that is embedded in a university community, is a space that can really bring together different constituencies. On the one hand, it’s a place where people who are already involved with music can find a place to work together, … but it’s also a space where we can bring together other parts of campus. One of my aspirations is to engage in some form of collaboration with other departments or programs and partnerships with other organizations in the Providence and the wider community. I think that an orchestra, by virtue of its scale and the breadth of what you can do with it, is perfectly situated to do that kind of work.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Is there an event planned for the orchestra that you are particularly looking forward to? </b></p>
<p class="p1">In the spring we are going to be working with a Syrian clarinetist and composer named Kinan Azmeh, who has performed with the Silkroad Ensemble and Yo-Yo Ma. He’s going to be working with a number of different groups on campus, but we’re going to be performing his clarinet concerto — which is actually still in the process of being written. It will be the East Coast premiere of the concerto because he’s doing the first concerts in February with the Seattle Symphony and then he’s coming to Providence and we’ll be performing it the next month, which is exciting.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>What are a few fun facts about you?</b></p>
<p class="p1">My claim to pop culture fame is that I was actually on screen in the first season of “Mozart in the Jungle.” The orchestra that I worked with in New York provided a lot of the on-screen orchestra for that show. I was only in the first season because I happened to be on sabbatical that semester, but it’s fun to be able to say I was a part of that.</p>
<p class="p1"><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
<strong><em>An earlier version of this story stated that the Brown University Orchestra's first concert will take place Oct. 21 and Oct. 22. In fact, the Brown University Orchestra's first concert will take place Oct. 20 and Oct 21. The Herald regrets the error.</em></strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Professor Isabel Hofmeyr opened her lecture Monday evening by taking the audience underwater. At the start of her talk, she detailed the dumping of books deemed unacceptable by the British Empire’s custom houses into what she termed “Davy Jones’ library.” Hofmeyr asked attendees to join her in imagining such a dumping ground — the ocean floor three miles off the coast of Durban Harbor in colonial South Africa — as littered with detritus, decomposed books, unused rifles and broken jewelry. Throughout her lecture, she would repeatedly return to the notion of shifting the center of gravity in colonial histories to water, a concept she calls “hydrocolonialism.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hofmeyr, a professor of African literature at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and professor of English at New York University, was invited to participate in this year’s edition of the annual Andrea Rosenthal Memorial Lecture. The Comparative Literature Department and the Center for Contemporary South Asia co-sponsored the lecture, titled “Shore-shaped Story: How Coast, Colony and Custom House Conduct Literature” at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. By examining goods entering the port city of Durban and the accompanying practices of customs officials, Hofmeyr gave insight into how categorization and censorship reinforced and shaped both colonial hierarchies and the literature that existed under them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All goods entering Durban on ships were subject to inspection and destruction by customs officials. Such officials had the authority to ban a book if they considered, as Hofmeyr quoted from a customs house record, “Page 67 (to be) objectionable.” Custom houses had control over what entered colonial territories, and thus, what people in these territories had access to. Hofmeyr explored the interaction between the nation state and literature, and how literature — and every other import — was defined in relation to the state. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">However, practices of categorizing and prohibiting objects were not standardized. Hofmeyr went so far as to call the system of customs “chaos,” and named the customs officials “dockside ontologists” who spontaneously created categories of being. Objects that did not conform to these acceptable categories of being were unceremoniously poured into the harbor beyond the territorial boundaries of the colony. This harbor became, as Hofmeyr said, “a dumping ground for objects and people considered waste.” In this chaos of categorization, customs officials gave great importance to marks of origin. Hofmeyr explained how every object had to have a mark of origin, and how copyrights became interchangeable with these marks. A British copyright, she said, by virtue of synonymousness with whiteness, became a racial trademark that indicated a good’s acceptability to customs officials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span></span></p>
<p class="p2">Hofmeyr displayed lists of goods entering the customs houses that were both extensive and humorous. For example, she pointed out how goods such as bones, books and boot polish were listed alphabetically, implying that they could all be processed in a similar manner. By focusing on the objects, Hofmeyr drew on “object-oriented ontology,” which, as she explained, seeks to examine objects as distinct from their interactions with humans.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There were a lot of cool specifics,” said Aliosha Bielenberg ’20 after the lecture. “Of course, I didn’t know anything about custom houses in 19th century Durban, South Africa. I don’t think anyone did.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the close of the lecture, Hofmeyr brought attendees back to the ocean floor off the coast of South Africa, now with a richer and fuller appreciation for the objects that lay there. As Hofmeyr addressed questions from the audience, listeners slowly emerged from this imagined underwater realm.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>RISD Museum exhibit delves into repair, renewal</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/19/risd-museum-exhibit-delves-repair-renewal/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island School of Design Museum’s latest exhibition, “Repair and Design Futures,” opened its nine-month run Oct. 5. The exhibition focuses on the theme of repair as a “material intervention, metaphor and call to action,” wrote Kate Irvin, RISD Museum curator of costumes and textiles in the installation’s opening wall text. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The exhibit comprises clothing and textiles, quilts and appliqués, embroidery pieces and assemblages, each of which contains tears and repairs of varying size. Each piece quietly contributes to the exhibition’s wider theme, featuring concealed stitches or carefully placed patches. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Irvin thought about the theme of repair — both the literal act and its metaphorical value — for many years before bringing this exhibition to fruition, she explained. The exhibition connects pieces from the RISD Museum’s permanent collection with a selection from the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It was important to me to really have a wide geographic as well as chronological range of objects,” Irvin said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Irvin highlighted “Work Coat (Noragi),” a cotton, indigo-dyed, patched and repaired Japanese coat by an unknown maker. She emphasized that she started thinking more carefully about repair after witnessing the interaction between the coat and current RISD students “who are making things in a world where we actually … already have too many things,” she said. She found this conjunction especially intriguing within the context of the “world today — which is a … very fragmented world, environmentally and socially,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The exhibition extends into the Museum’s Café Pearl, where “Lessons from Jacob Lawrence” — a collaboration between artist and designer Christina Kim, improvisational quilter Laverne Brackens and artisans at the Shuktara Trust, an Indian charity benefiting homeless children with disabilities — hangs on the large wall facing the Benefit Street entrance. The final product of a project which began in 2004,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the exhibit comprises 12 quilts — an expanse of color and stitches. The quilt parses together scraps of old saris and textile from Kim’s clothing and houseware company, using improvisational quilting techniques from several generations of black American quilt-makers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Christina Kim has always been … very committed to sustainability and ethical practice,” Irvin said, adding that “Lessons from Jacob Lawrence” focused on “keeping some traditions that are beginning to fall away, alive,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the Donghia Costumes and Textiles Study Center down the hall in the Museum, “Repair and Design Futures” continues with “Lost in the Museum,” an exhibit curated by Anna Rose Keefe, the costume and textiles department conservation assistant. “Lost in the Museum” displays a series of textiles and clothing pieces that were unlabeled and forgotten in the RISD Museum’s inventory boxes for years, rendering them inaccessible, Keefe explained. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Keefe pulled out every object that had no established provenance, comparing the physical objects to the inventory records. “Certainly the pieces that are there — they are kind of flashy, there is a lot of metallic thread, there’s a lot of embroidery techniques, things that are really distinctive,” she said. “I was able to do some research, identify the techniques, and then cross-reference” the inventory, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This process is what grounds “Lost in the Museum” in the practice of creating objects, Keefe said. “All of the rectifications that I did were made possible by understanding how objects come together,” she said, emphasizing that this exhibition is well-suited to RISD students, who are inspired by pieces like those displayed. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The exhibition came together during the months following the 2016 presidential election, Keefe said. “I do think in a lot of ways people are sort of feeling broken right now, and we are confronting those feelings,” she said, adding, “I think it’s good to think about a path forward, to conceptualize solutions, because right now it feels like we have a lot of problems.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A series of lectures, programs and workshops will accompany the exhibition throughout the academic year. “It’s also not just an exhibition — it’s really meant to be a space for interdisciplinary programs,” Irvin said, adding, “The whole idea is that these are objects that will, I hope, touch on conversation that will lead to thought and practice in many disciplines beyond the … apparel and textile medium,” Irvin added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mitski’s latest album offers listeners emotional complexity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mitski’s latest album “Be the Cowboy” distills complex emotions; in her clear voice, the artist captures love and loneliness. The singer-songwriter performed at House of Blues Boston on Oct. 20 as part of her U.S. tour.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The album opens with a burst of emotion. “Geyser” builds itself up, culminating explosively and passionately both lyrically and instrumentally: “I will be the one you need, the way I can’t be without you,” Mitski sings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mitski addresses relationships from many angles. She explores the eruptive passion of love and reflects on its difficulties. “You’re growing tired of me … sorry I don’t want your touch, it’s not that I don’t want you” she sings in “A Pearl.” She does not simplify or romanticize relationships, instead opting to portray them as multidimensional.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She also relates a deep desire for purpose. In “Remember My Name,” she conveys her need for recognition and legacy. “I want someone to remember me. I need something bigger than the sky, hold it in my arms and know it’s mine.” In this song, Mitski explores the tensions of ambition and the desire to leave an impact on others and the world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The upbeat “Nobody,” which was released as a single before the rest of the album, sounds deceptively happy. Though the music is fast-paced and carefree, she intones “My God, I’m so lonely, so I open the window, to hear sounds of people.” This song exemplifies the layered irony in Mitski’s portrayal of emotions, where little is as it seems. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The album slows as it concludes. In “Pink in the Night,” Mitski takes us back to a raw depiction of love. She captures a certain juvenile purity, conveying genuine yearning. “I know I’ve kissed you before, but I didn’t do it right. Can I try again, try again, try again,” she sings. There is a certain innocence to this desperation, the vulnerability and naivete that accompanies love. At the end of the song, she repeats: “I love you, I love you, I love you.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The album ends with the torturously nostalgic “Two Slow Dancers.” Instrumentally, this piece is simple; it begins with only a piano, and there is a slow orchestral buildup. It tells a story of love, loss and growing old. “Doesn’t it smell like a school gymnasium in here?” she sings, invoking nostalgic images of adolescence. But this song’s tragedy lies precisely in the fact that we must grow up: “It would be a hundred times easier, if we were young again. But as it is, and it is.” Aging is a fact of life which we are helpless to change, something that just “is.” The song illustrates the inevitability of change, and evokes a longing for the past. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The clarity of “Be the Cowboy”is a kind of honesty; this is the closest look at Mitski listeners have been afforded so far. It is explosive passion and deep melancholy all at once. In her storytelling, she bares her heart, calling out to us: “remember my name.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">“Dear listeners, apologies for our late response. … We’ve been busy making stories about what it means to apologize,” said Mitchell Johnson ’18.5 and Alex Hanesworth ’20, managing editors of Brown and Rhode Island School of Design’s joint audio storytelling collective “Now Here This.” The audio performance “SORRY, A Live Listening Party” was presented within the RISD Museum’s new exhibition, “Repair and Design Futures.”</p>
<p class="p2">“This event is about repair and healing, but also absent apologies, the refusal to forgive and what happens when saying sorry isn’t enough,” Hanesworth said. The event featured four speakers, all of whom presented renditions of podcasts they released in the spring. Each speaker addressed the themes of conflict, reconciliation and healing.</p>
<p class="p2">Raina Wellman, a RISD student, began the conversation by addressing apologies. She was introduced by Hanesworth as the resident apology expert at “Now Here This” — who cited her collection of apology artifacts, recent writing about apology cakes and 77-song playlist titled “The Museum of Apology,” as evidence of her proficiency. Wellman took the audience on a tour of her museum, listing and explaining a few of her song selections and the scenarios they might fit.</p>
<p class="p2">“If you’re sorry for being foolish, I wo<span class="s1">uld suggest, “I’m Sorry” by Brenda Lee,” Wellman began. Lee sings, “You tell me mistakes / Are part of being young / But that don’t right / The wrong that’s been done.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The song expresses the universal emotions of unrequited love, Wellman explained in her podcast. Lee’s 1960 anthem inspired many future apology songs. Another pick, “Apology Song” by The Decemberists, apologizes to a friend for losing his bike. “I’m really sorry Steven, but your bicycle’s been stolen,” lead singer Colin Meloy sings in the 2001 release. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Next, Alina Kulman ’21 touched on the themes of conflict and reconciliation by recounting a debate centered around gun ranges in the small city of Jamestown, Rhode Island. Inspired by the discovery of a highlighted and heavily annotated binder of rules and regulations on a family friend’s kitchen table, Kulman decided to investigate the city’s battle over private gun ranges and tell a story “about how a debate on guns in a small Rhode Island town got out of hand.”</p>
<p class="p2">Her presentation featured an interview from Nick Robertson, a man who grew up shooting guns in Iowa and moved to Jamestown when he joined the Navy at age 17. Robertson raises horses on the island and built a range behind his stables — he is a firm supporter of private gun ranges, which became heavily contested as the city urbanized.</p>
<p class="p2">After years of debate, Kristine Trocki, the Town Council President, hosted a meeting on April 10, 2017 to decide the future of Jamestown gun ranges. The meeting was heavily attended and emotional — Robertson responded angrily to a motion to adopt a total ban. After hours of deliberation, the town council passed a ban by a vote of 3-2, with some amendments. Now, shooting enthusiasts like Robertson must travel to ranges nearby in Narragansett or Newport, “because maybe shooting behind your house doesn’t make sense anymore, if your new neighbor and their dog now only live a couple hundred feet away,” Kulman explained.</p>
<p class="p2">Babette Thomas ’20 followed with a look at memory and the process of healing with “At the Kitchen Table,” a conversation she shared with three other black students about their individual stories and the University’s ties to slavery. “We talked about the African American experience as it relates to slavery, and what it means to go to school in a place like Providence, at a school like Brown, which has such deep ties to the … slave trade,” Thomas said.</p>
<p class="p2">“I wanted to make something that would last. I wanted to make a memorial to our ancestors who are so often forgotten,” Thomas said, adding that she looked to create a space that would encourage people to consider the responsibility of places like Brown and RISD in their historical role in the institution of slavery.</p>
<p class="p2">The program closed with Donia Torabian’s ’20 “Healing Meditations” — a series of meditations aimed to help guide women of color through trauma. “We are all keepers of our own fire, we need to be tended and fed and loved, so that we may be warm, and warm others,” the meditation began. “And as a fire-keeper you should share your warmth,” Torabian continued.</p>
<p class="p2">The presentation asked listeners to consider the boundaries of apologizing, and then, of repair — fitting with the themes of the Museum’s exhibition. Slips of paper left on the stools and benches in the gallery asked guests to share an apology of their own — to be left anonymously, and to possibly begin internal mending.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Amin Husain and Nitasha Dhillon from the group MTL Collective analyzed activist efforts during recent global crises through the lens of modern art in a talk Tuesday at Pembroke Hall. MTL is a collective that aims to move toward decolonial freedom by exploring and blurring the lines between activism and artistic practice, according to Husain and Dhillon. Based in New York, it frequently takes on new projects in its efforts to deepen solidarity in response to movements and consider the spaces between politics and culture.</p>
<p class="p2">Husain and Dhillon h<span class="s1">ave both been a part of many different movements, such as Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter and Direct Action Front for Palestine.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The talk began with a video entitled “Training in Practice of Freedom.” Showing protests for Black Lives Matter and worker demands, the video’s purpose was often highlighted through text. Quotes such as “Our liberation is either a collective or it is nonexistent”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>occupied the screen and allowed the audience to fully immerse themselves in the meaning and experience of the words. “As we disrupt and refuse the role that art is now playing in the normal functioning of this global system which propagates racism and inequality, in its shadows we make space for something new to come into the world,” another quote read. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Art embedded in struggle” is a recurrent theme the collective explores, Husain said. “Consumer debt, education debt, housing debt, health care debt — I mean, those are the things that are actually about freedom and our relationship with time.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The speakers questioned the difference between organizing and activism — examining what the public recognizes as the work done by each action and what kind of elitist impressions are left on the world as a result. Husain argued that although the failure of language suggests “we don’t have the means to understand each other,” these differences between organizing and activism are not crystal clear and “these distinctions create conditions” that deserve our attention. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">When asked about the primary purpose of Decolonize This Place, another movement the speakers are engaged in,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dhillon gave a two-fold answer. First, “Decolonize This Place is more around a structural response to the (crises) that we are seeing everywhere, be it an economic crisis or a crisis of racism. … It’s more visionary organizing than just being responsive.” She talked about how one can resist colonialism in all its different forms and also emphasized the importance of the relationships that are necessary for our freedom to exist. Dhillon then addressed the movement’s second purpose: to explore what it would mean to be in solidarity with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Husain added that when selecting the projects they chose to explore, the collective is “trying to open up spaces, decolonize spaces that won’t open themselves up and (focus) on cultural institutions and galleries” as infrastructure that support movements in an effort to “change the conversation and build the organizing possibilities.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sherena Razek GS said MTL’s “work is imperative and it is part of a longer, ongoing movement that seeks to overhaul the museum as we know it.” Moreover, Husain talks about the extremely positive reactions from the public as resonating because they “see it and are a part of it.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Mid90s’ paints poignant portrait of teenage aspirations, struggles</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Jonah Hill’s film “Mid90s” transfixes viewers from the start with close-up skateboarding shots and action-packed scenes that reveal turmoil at home. The film follows 13-year-old Stevie’s (played by Sunny Suljic) summer adventures in Los Angeles as he weaves between life at home with his single mom (Katherine Waterston) and abusive older brother Ian (Lucas Hedges). </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The film features a colorful cast of characters as members of Stevie’s friend group. Ruben (Gio Galicia) is the youngest of the group and instantly connects with Stevie, easing Stevie’s initial transition into the group. Fourth Grade (Ryder McLaughlin) adds some welcome comic relief and unique visuals to the film with his own choppy footage of his friends skateboarding, partying and driving. Ray (Na-kel Smith), the leader of the group, dreams of a future within the skateboarding world and takes Stevie under his wing. On the other hand, Fuckshit (Olan Prenatt) has an attitude that matches his nickname and is constantly on the lookout for fun, drugs and alcohol. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The film is painfully realistic in its presentation of young adolescents trying to find their way in the world. Stevie’s relationships with the older members of the group serve as an important foil to his fractured bond with his own elder brother. In a particularly poignant scene, Ray takes Stevie to an abandoned skate park and mentors him into the early hours of the morning; the two even end up sleeping overnight in the park. But Ruben and Stevie’s relationship gradually sours over the course of the film as they compete for the attention of the older boys, and comes to a head in a physical fight toward the end of the film. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">At times the film is uncomfortable to watch because it hits so close to home, touching on issues such as abuse, depression, addiction and poverty. The film’s presentation of these subjects is only surface-level, but snapshots of Stevie’s life could suggest deeper internal struggles. Stevie’s complicated relationship with his brother and mother are never fully fleshed out, nor are the home lives of the group, but in this film there’s no need. Hill refuses to diagnose or label Stevie or his friends for us and chooses instead to just present them as they are — young, confused and passionate. Viewers empathize with Stevie as he gradually develops his skateboarding skills, from the first time he flips his board to the time he tries to skate over a gap in the roof and falls — only to get right back up with a huge smile. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Mid90s” is also full of contradictions, and it toys with the audience’s expectations. Stevie does everything that Ian expressly forbids: “Don’t go in my room, don’t touch my stuff, don’t hang out with those kids.” In another break from convention, a police officer at a skate park begins by berating the boys for trespassing but instead proceeds to joke around with Fuckshit and walk away without taking further action. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The ending of the film also subverts expectations, concluding very abruptly; Stevie wakes up in the hospital after a drunk driving accident engineered by Fuckshit. As Stevie is surrounded by his friends and mom, it looks like just another day in his life —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but all of a sudden the film cuts to Fourth Grade’s camerawork and the curtain closes on the production. This conclusion provides a gritty finish and reflects life — the ending you expect doesn’t always happen. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Mid90s” toes the line between a comedy and a drama. There are moments in the film that will leave viewers chuckling and others that only warrant gasps. The film is a candid portrait of what it means to be a teenager grappling with newfound independence and how to cultivate healthy relationships. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Ivy Film Festival hosted an advance screening of “Mid90s” Oct. 15 at the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. The film is currently being screened at the Providence Place Mall.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jean Shin, a renowned installation artist and adjunct professor of fine art at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, greeted her audience with soft wind chimes and a projection of a colorful, kinetic canopy — what would soon be revealed as the fabric of broken umbrellas, layered and stitched together — during her Visiting Artist lecture last Wednesday. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Speaking about some of the themes that have inspired her work — which include community, environment, waste and history — Shin detailed a number of the major installation projects she has completed throughout her career. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Jean’s work truly transforms everyday objects,” said Heather Bhandari, an adjunct lecturer in the Visual Art Department and coordinator of the Visiting Artist program. Bhandari met Shin 15 years ago while she was working at Mixed Greens, a contemporary art gallery that represented Shin, Bhandari told The Herald. She further recalled a time when she would call Shin to notify her when she found broken or discarded umbrellas on various New York City street corners. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The umbrellas Shin collected were used in “Penumbra,” commissioned in 2003 by Socrates Sculpture Park in New York. Utilizing “the tragic umbrella,” Shin explained, she created canopies that freed the nylon umbrella-tops from their isolating, individualized skeletons and combined them into one collective awning. The canopy hung from tree branches, fluidly responding to wind and weather, something Shin had not fully considered in her creative process. This project exemplified the ways in which expectations had to become compromises, as her installations became one with the environment that surrounded them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There are a lot of artists who I think have these moments where they wonder, ‘What am I doing putting more stuff into the world and where is this stuff going?’” Bhandari said, and added that Shin avoids that issue by “using trash, in most cases, to create these really amazing pieces that have a lot of depth to them.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Shin’s choice to reclaim discarded materials came from both an acknowledgement of consumer culture and her own position as “an emerging artist with a very low-paying full-time job — so it kind of made sense for me to think about the resourcefulness of my materials,” she told The Herald. “I was seeing so much excess just thrown out on the streets of New York City.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other materials Shin used include non-winning lottery tickets — discarded not for their inconvenience or fragility but simply because they were valueless. After noticing the tickets littering the streets, Shin considered taking risks that went against the odds, she said. “There was kind of a wonderful analogous comparison for me about how these losing tickets really were symbolic of all of our lives,” Shin said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Collecting thousands of thrown-away tickets, Shin constructed towers and relied on gravity as she stacked the cards without any adhesive in three different museum spaces. “Chance City” was first created with $17,119 worth of discarded “Scratch and Win” lottery tickets at the Caren Golden Gallery in New York in 2002, according to the artist’s website. It was most recently constructed in 2009 with $32,404 worth of discarded tickets at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The towers — assembled by hand, without glue — were inherently fleeting, but were the result of a long, arduous and specific process. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The idea of connecting her own story as an artist to those of the thousands of individuals represented by losing lottery tickets is reflected in many of her pieces. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There were a lot of objects that really just connected a story to a story that I felt like I was living, and that maybe others could connect to” as well, she said. Other objects Shin has used in pieces include vinyl records, prescription pill bottles, discarded post-alteration pant cuffs, old trophies and green plastic soda bottles — all discarded symbols of lives lived, of individual stories coming together to create a collective message. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Shin also emphasized the influence of her Korean-American background on her work as an artist. After finishing her education, Shin “felt a disconnection to the history of art, even though it is one that I had been brought to learn,” she said. “People who were Asian-American, people who were women, people of color, were not represented” as painters. She then delved into the practice of installation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I just went where there was least resistance, I think, and I kind of reveled in feeling whole. There was a history that I was connected to,” she said. “In my practice I’m hoping that I can make a mark within that history as well.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Monday night, the Department of Literary Arts hosted Irish novelist John Banville, author of Booker Prize-winning novel “The Sea.” Though small in size, the audience present in Salomon Center 001 listened with rapt attention as Professor of English Paul Armstrong opened a conversation with Banville on various literary subjects.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Academic Program Director and Senior Lecturer Gale Nelson introduced Banville as “a writer of incomparable gifts.” For readers interested in adding Banville’s works to their repertoire, “a logical place to start with would be ‘The Sea’,” Nelson said, proceeding to also recommend “The Book of Evidence,” “Ghosts” and “Athena.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From the very start, Banville’s interactions with the audience were characterized by his dry sense of humor. He first addressed audience members by jokingly thanking them for “finding (their) way into this crowded auditorium” and added that he “hardly recognized” the praise Nelson had flattered him with.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Banville began by reading two passages from his novel, “The Infinities.” One might compare “The Infinities” to “a composition by Bach or Mozart,” Nelson said, adding that the work is not only “structurally sure, (but) is also exquisite in terms of pace, language and point of view.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Following the reading, Banville was joined by Armstrong, who discussed the process of writing and delved deeper into some Banville’s works.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You said I should read ‘The Infinities’ because it is the work of yours that disgusts you the least,” began Armstrong, asking Banville what he meant by this statement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“‘The Infinites’ is the book that came nearest to what I set out to do,” Banville responded, adding that writers often start out with wonderful optimism and then halfway through the process of writing the novel, “we’re wading through muck. … That’s what novels do.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But with “The Infinites”, he believes he got “somewhere close to what he (planned to do).”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Armstrong proceeded to discuss various aspects of the process of writing and the idea of whether authors produce art consciously or subconsciously. “When I started writing I felt very much in control,” Banville said. “When we’re young, we think old age brings wisdom, but of course, old age just brings confusion,” he said sarcastically, adding, however, that confusion is a good state for novelists.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You realize that art is made in darkness,” he said. “We think we’re reasoning, but in fact we’re drifting. … All knowledge is in retrospect.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The conversation soon steered toward Banville’s sources of inspiration. “My biggest influences would be Henry James and (William Butler) Yeats,” Banville said, describing how James “captures the sense of what is it to be alive,” while Yeats taught him “not to be afraid of grandeur and stately language and not to write down.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Armstrong concluded the discussion by asking what advice Banville would give to aspiring writers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The only advice I could give to a young writer is to look into the world and not into your own soul,” Banville said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“First of all, you haven’t got a soul — it’s a myth,” he joked, ending on a more serious note by saying,“it’s the world that counts.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>A previous version of this article <span class="s2">mistakenly referred to The Infinities as The Infinites. The article also misquoted </span>Professor of English Paul Armstrong’s opening remarks to John Banville. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Photographs of trash, animal carcasses and picturesque views were displayed at the opening reception of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Traditional Terrain,” a photo and sound exhibition by Luke Moldof GS. Based on the theme of bridges, the show featured sounds of traffic humming, trains rumbling and bridges creaking — as well as slideshows and videos — that supplemented the photos mounted on the walls. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Initially, the photos in Gallery 221 in List Art Building did not appear to have much in common. Along with litter and dead animals, Moldof photographed a motorcyclist crossing a bridge, rivers, crushed orange cones, cityscapes and much more. But these seemingly unrelated pictures, videos and sounds were all recorded on bridges or presented bridges as their subjects. Many of the captured locations are recognizable, such as the iconic Crook Point Bascule Bridge, which connects Providence and East Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moldof, a sixth-year student in the PhD program in Computer Music and Multimedia, decided to photograph and record bridges to document both sound and sight. “I knew it would give me the flexibility to do almost anything,” Moldof said. One of his major goals, he explained, was to find a project that would be interesting both visually and aurally.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I realized I could make recordings of the bridge itself, like the bridge shaking, with contact mics. They pick up vibrations instead of sound traveling through air,” Moldof said. He also used hydrophones, which pick up vibrations underwater. Moldof played these sounds from speakers in List to create<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an atmosphere that mimicked the environment in which he had recorded them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Moldof’s description of the exhibit, “The goal is to create immersive and potentially overwhelming audiovisual content commonly experienced, but often ignored,” he wrote on the Music department’s website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His exhibit highlights the sights and sounds of bridges ­— a category of urban space that is often classified in art according to its architectural beauty or significance, Moldof said. Moldof focuses on the minute as well as the monumental, the garbage as well as the glamour, to create an experience which is familiar, rather than overwhelming. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Traditional Terrain” is an exhibition of Moldof’s PhD dissertation project, in which he compiled his photos and recordings into a book and CD respectively. The book, also titled “Traditional Terrain,” includes hundreds of thematically linked photographs taken by Moldof. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Sandra Arnold GS, a graduate student in Public Humanities and a graduate fellow at the Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice, reflected on the theme that Moldof had selected. “After I spoke to the artist and the artist explained the exhibit and explained his purpose behind his work, I understood his choices in selecting the pieces he chose for the exhibit,” Arnold said. She also mentioned her personal connection with certain photographs. “Some of what I saw in there I connected with personally, even though probably his intention was focused on his theme,” she added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Next to Normal,” running Nov 1-11 at the Stuart Theater, features a raw and moving story delivered by outstanding student actors. Sock and Buskin’s latest show revolves around Diana Goodman, a woman who struggles with bipolar disorder and grief. The curtain opens on her, and audience members are immediately aware of the intricacies of her relationships with her family: supportive husband Dan, overachieving daughter Natalie and manipulative son Gabe. As the musical progresses, the audience quickly realizes that Diana’s relationship with her supposedly 18-year-old son Gabe is actually a mirage — her son died when he was an infant. Throughout the play, as Diana tries to confront her own grief, her family is forced to come to terms with the problems that afflict their own lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The musical, directed by Addie Gorlin GS, a graduate student from the Trinity/Brown program, provided excellent performances that moved the audience, prompting tears and a standing ovation at the end of the show. Temma Schaechter ’21 and Jimmy Damore ’19.5 played Diana and Dan, respectively, and were especially exceptional performances. Kayla Kirk ’19 as Natalie impressed with a convincing interpretation of a teenager grappling with her romantic life, mental health and family relationships. Schaechter portrayed Diana with nuance, supported by her incredible voice. Dan’s kind frustration with his wife’s illness was always evident in Damore’s performance. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The music — like the story — is powerful and uninhibited. The characters explain themselves without affectation or farce, and quick changes in perspective or emotion are matched by sudden shifts in the music, often without interludes. The soundtrack does not fade from one song to the next, and these abrupt transitions create an auditory link between the sincerity of the charactrs and the tumult of the score.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The set design is inspired, versatile and adds to the show both symbolically and emotionally. The white two-story house made of almost transparent material allowed the lighting to determine the tone of the stage. When emotions run high, the entire set is enveloped in red or purple light, and the transparency of the walls gives the audience glimpses into secret actions of characters. Built as a circular platform, the set periodically moves to signal shifts in temporality in the play. Several times during the show, the set rotates continuously during a song to highlight passion or confusion as some characters stand on the stable part of the stage while others are caught up in the spiraling circle.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Friday evening after the performance, Leon J. Hilton, assistant professor of theatre arts and performance studies, facilitated a discussion with Rendueles Villalba, clinical associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School, and Linda Welsh, a psychologist at counseling and psychological services.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The discussion focused on the depiction of mental illness in the show and in theater generally. Villalba and Welsh clarified some aspects of the show, explaining subtleties of bipolar disorder and grief. Villalba appreciated the three-dimensional perspective of the lead character. He had previously worried that she might end up being<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>portrayed as a “caricature of the (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders),” he said. Both Villalba and Welsh noted the ways that theater can allow for the destigmatization of topics generally considered difficult to discuss, such as mental illness.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Poet Stacy Szymaszek discusses mundanity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lights were dimmed down with only a single spotlight cast upon Stacy Szymaszek. Other than the occasional grins and brief chuckles from the audience seats, the only sound cutting through the air was her voice. The poet was invited to speak as a guest of the Literary Arts department’s Writers on Writing lecture series. During the one and a half hour reading, everyone listened attentively as Szymaszek read a couple of her recent poems, present excerpts from her book “A Year from Today” and discuss her creative process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rather than giving a conventional introduction of Szymaszek, Mónica de la Torre, a professor of Literary Arts, placed her phone close to the microphone to let the audience hear a recording of herself talking about Szymaszek’s work on her way to breakfast. She chose to start the reading this way in an effort to get a “point across that what (Szymaszek) is doing is radical,” de la Torre said. Integrating the sights she sees during her walk, de la Torre introduced Szymaszek in the recording as an author who not only engages with the audience, but also expands the definition of poetry.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Szymaszek, a poet and arts administrator of the Poetry Project, read her presentation on line breaks, which gave insight into her writing process. Among the many aspects of her writing, she touched upon the absence of punctuation in her poetry unless used for rare emphasis. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She further discussed the unconventional square shape of her book “A Year from Today.” This format was the result of an unwillingness to compromise the structure of her poems to be more compatible with commercial publication.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After her reading, there was a brief Q&amp;A session for the audience to satisfy its curiosity on Szymaszek’s writing. When asked about the frequent religious references in her poetry, she answered that she “really wanted to be Catholic” but “always felt rejected” by religious institutions. Rather, she felt “like poetry was a calling for (her),” she explained, adding that she had always liked the symbolism and “drama” that religion entails. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The performance left many readers with long-lasting impressions and thoughtful reflections. Akua Afari ’22, who is also a student of the LITR 0710: “Writers on Writing” first-year seminar, said that “it was quite interesting how she aestheticized mundane things.” Because the subject of Szymaszek’s poetry takes root in everyday life, it allows the audience “to see the beauty of it,” Afari said, and to further appreciate “how much is put into creating art,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“What she brings to poetry is a really beautiful, generous, capacious approach that makes us focus not as much on the finished result of writing a poem. It’s not about individual poems and what they accomplish, but about the practice of poetry as a lived thing,” de la Torre said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Acoustic performances brighten the Underground</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last Thursday night, the Underground brimmed with guitar chords and raw vocals as students performed acoustically at Gigs Underground, hosted by the Student Activities Office and Brown University Class Coordinating Board. The event kicked off the Student Activities Office’s new monthly “Underground Thursdays” performance-based series.</p>
<p class="p2">Student performers Marijke Perry ’22, Paul Abrams ’21, Belu-Olisa Sarkissian ’21, Felipe Félix Méndez ’22, Cameron McKie ’19 and Emilia Halvorsen ’19 took to the stage — a cleared space at the back of the room fitted with a mic stand and a stool — to present their diverse acoustic sounds, including original compositions and covers.</p>
<p class="p2">Emilia Halvorsen ’19 performed in the final slot of the event, which initially gave her reason to expect a smaller audience, she said. She found the contrary to be true — the Underground still bustled with audience members, some wandering in from the adjacent Young Arcade, pool cues still in hand.</p>
<p class="p2">Halvorsen played a selection of her original songs — including some that she hopes to feature on an EP that would be released this fall. One such song focused on changing relationships and autumn, a theme she explored because she sees this season as “a time for transformation — for seeing things differently as you see the leaves changing around you,” she said. Halvorsen also sang a cover of Neil Young’s “Harvest Moon,” another ode to the fall season and fitting with the venue’s apple cider-laden vibes.</p>
<p class="p2">The event came as a continuation of last month’s Gigs on the Grass, a day-long festival featuring student performers. In the three years Gigs on the Grass has been running, this is the first time the event has been extended to a night of acoustic performances.</p>
<p class="p2">While Gigs on the Grass featured mostly bands and groups, Gigs Underground was distinguished by highlighting solo performances.</p>
<p class="p2">“We had over 60 auditions” for Gigs on the Grass, said Melissa Lee ’20, community outreach officer of Class Coordinating Board 2020. “We wanted to be able to (showcase) those musicians who obviously work very hard and are very, very talented,” she added. As such, Lee collaborated with the Student Activities Office to create an outlet to accommodate<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>acoustic, coffee-house sounds.</p>
<p class="p2">These student musicians, along with a few additions, were invited to perform at Gigs Underground, which offered the smaller, more intimate setting their sound required, said Megan Evonsion ’20, a Campus Programmer at the Student Activities Office.</p>
<p class="p2">Evonsion and Halvorsen commented that the event was one of few on campus that catered specifically to individual, acoustic performers.</p>
<p class="p2">“I feel like it is really strange that Brown doesn’t have a regular open mic for people,” Halverson said, noting that groups and ensembles are generally given more opportunities to perform on campus.</p>
<p class="p2">“It is really cool to be able to see who else is out there doing similar things — there are so many people with hidden talents here,” Halvorsen added. She emphasized the importance of a “space to try things out and (learn) what goes well in front of an audience, because there is no other way to learn that besides performing.”</p>
<p class="p2">“We’re hoping that (Gigs Underground) will encourage people, especially other students and their classmates, to see all the wonderful talents that students have,” Evonsion said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Thursday Nov. 1, artist Danny Lyon sat down and discussed his life, as well as his artistic interactions with politics and morality, at the List Art Center Auditorium. His talk launched the David Winton Bell Gallery’s latest exhibition, titled “The Only Thing I Saw Worth Leaving,” which showcases a collection of Lyon’s work and will run until Dec. 19.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bell Gallery recently made it a goal to draw the Brown community’s attention to its own permanent collection of artworks, said Allison Pappas GS. This permanent collection includes a large portion of Lyon’s work, with the current exhibition presenting over a hundred of Lyon’s photographs and four of his films. In addition, Lyon’s work — “which has a strong social and political engagement” — easily ties into activity on Brown’s campus, Pappas said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The exhibition features photographs from four of Lyon’s most significant series, including “Memories of the Southern Civil Rights Movement,” “The Bikeriders,” “The Destruction of Lower Manhattan” and “Conversations with the Dead.” These four series of photographs were developed in the 1960s, when Lyon was in his twenties. The four documentaries showcased in the exhibition space were all crafted at a later stage in Lyon’s career.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lyon often focuses on the themes of empathy and freedom in his artwork. “Driven by concern for the marginalized and disenfranchised, Lyon has chronicled civil rights protests as the first official photographer for the (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee),” said Jo-Ann Conklin, the director of the Bell Gallery. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“He was making photographs of things that were not photographed by anyone else when he first started,” Pappas added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lyon is distinguished as an artist by his ability to connect with the subjects in his work and to show them as real people through their own words and actions. “His particular vision, his approach is unique. Part of the reasons the photographs are so strong is that you get a sense through them of his connection to people,” Pappas said. She highlighted the photographs taken within an American prison as epitomizing his ability to cut through the boundaries of different backgrounds and to simply connect with people for who they are. This artistic faculty renders Lyon’s work “incredibly malleable,” Pappas said. “That is quite powerful,” and differentiates Lyon’s work from that of others, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Lyon focused on photography for the majority of the 1960s, he moved toward the medium of documentary later in his life. Seemingly about nothing and everything simultaneously, his documentaries can be described as “environmental portraits,” Pappas said. The films “show you who these people are,” she added. “They attempt to flesh things out in a different way than the photographs.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In Lyon’s talk, he discussed how he found himself and his art growing as his artistic maturity developed. “I had thought of myself as a journalist, but I was functioning like an artist,” Lyon said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Criteria of Beauty,” curated by Qualeasha Wood and Dāa Guy, seniors at the Rhode Island School of Design, showcases work representing perspectives existing “outside the boundaries of whiteness, heteronormativity and gender binaries,” according to the exhibition’s wall text. The exhibition will run Nov. 6 to 25 at the RISD Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. The show features a wide array of media ­— including textiles, sculpture, audiovisuals and illustrations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The exhibition is a form of “fighting all these boxes and labels, that people put (queer artists of color) in,” Wood said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The curatorsn noted a need for queer artists of color entering a gallery space to challenge its structures. “How do we psychologically deal with the reality that this space was used to objectify and commodify us in the past?” Guy asked, reflecting on the process of curating “Criteria of Beauty.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The curators spoke of the tensions artists of color face in most gallery spaces. “When POC artists are put in galleries, it’s still voyeuristic,” Wood said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This exhibition is a challenge and reclamation of the existing gallery setting, in order to “shift its trajectory, to be something that puts us in power,” Guy said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To this end, the exhibition created a space that values art expressing perspectives of queer people of color. “The goal of the show was to give POC artists an opportunity to define — for themselves — what their work means in a gallery setting, and in a personal setting,” Wood said. “You define your own reality. Your experiences are your own, your voice is your own,” she continued. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The exhibition prioritizes artists’ expression by giving them a space to reclaim the gallery setting by their own means. “We want to change the space, not only for everyone who walks in, but for the people (showing) in it,” Wood said. “I think a lot of people who came into the show made work for themselves.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The show also served as a catalyst and allowed for the exchange of meaningful feedback as an “important moment” that opened the dialogue for artists concerned with conversations that extend beyond the normative boundaries of white and heteronormative standards of artistic expression, Guy said. “We’re often not offered the critique — or the help we deserve — in this community of artists.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The impact of the exhibition extended to younger artists who identify as queer people of color and are looking for similar spaces for their art and expression, Wood said. It was important “for sophomores and first-years to see that you can create these spaces for yourself, to get the feedback and critique you deserve,” Guy said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As such, the call for works put out by Guy and Wood took a non-traditional approach that allowed artists to create freely. The artists were given the show’s statement, Wood explained, and were asked to “submit whatever (they) think fits our statement, and (to) show us the work (they’re) excited about, that (they) care about,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nadia Wolff<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>’21 RISD ’21 showed two pieces at the exhibition, including one entitled “Linoleum Flowers, Tools for Queer Coding,” near the entrance of the gallery. Wolff explained that the piece is concerned with “queer representation … and how that is in conflict with traditional ideas of feminine presentation.” Wolff attempted to “possess … the identity-specific notions of beauty, of belonging, of home” in both pieces, they said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The exhibition is an “act of healing,” Wood said. “Your experience is valuable. I think a lot of people struggle with believing that,” Guy added. “The moment you start to believe that, is the moment you find out how powerful your voice is.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>“Protest Art and Activism” examines art world’s activism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Co-organized by the David Winton Bell Gallery and the Brown Arts Initiative, “On Protest Art and Activism” is a series of exhibits currently on display at the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. The series “highlights the work of artists and the differing ways they engage the social and political issues of their time,” wrote Ian Russell, curator of the Bell Gallery, in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The installments feature works selected from the exhibition “An Incomplete History of Protest” at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Part I of the exhibit, which ran from Oct. 1 to Oct. 28, examined “how artists use histories of protest to create works in response to contemporary activism,” Russell wrote. This first installment showcased works by Ja’Tovia Gary, Theaster Gates, Josephine Meckseper and Dread Scott. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The closing reception of the exhibition’s first installment took place Friday, following a discussion panel featuring Russell, University Archivist Jennifer Betts and Assistant Curators at the Whitney Museum Jennie Goldstein and Rujeko Hockley.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The conversation was concerned with constructing “a curatorial narrative around the history and impact of protest art and artistic activism,” according to the event description on the University’s website. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both Hockley and Goldstein spoke about their curatorial choices regarding the construction and organization of the show, which were inextricable from the current geopolitical situation. “We really were making these decisions as the world was unfolding all around us,” Goldstein said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Decisions regarding what was to be included in the original exhibition were informed by the dramatically evolving political mood. “We were working on it in the context of a newly inaugurated president,” Hockley added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are also limits to what can be captured and represented in an exhibition, from a curatorial perspective. For instance, Goldstein highlighted that in the Whitney exhibition, “one omission that became very glaring to me … was that we do not have works in the collection that address the disability rights movement,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These omissions often stem from the complications of acquisitions and the changing priorities people hold when viewing and collecting works, according to Hockley. “The ways in which our own collecting instincts, strategies and desires shifted over time is also something we have to contend with,” Hockley said. She expanded on the idea that evolving sensibilities throughout time accorded varying levels of artistic visibility to different social justice movements. “There are so many ways things come into collections. … It is not neutral, and it is complicated,” she continued. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The gaps she noted in the Whitney’s exhibition were further recognized by the public. “We heard a lot from people — about what we were doing wrong (and) … what they thought we were maybe getting right,” Goldstein said. “We need that. Because — of course — we have blind spots,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Whitney exhibition’s title acknowledges its own limits. “The incompleteness of the title is a kind of caveat for us. We realize we don’t have everything. We can’t tell every story,” Goldstein said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Part II of “Protest Art and Activism,” is now showing at the Bell Gallery and will run until Dec. 19. This second installation of the series “examines the ongoing impact of women artists within the feminist movements of the last four decades,” Russell wrote.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It will feature “works by Hermine Freed, Guerrilla Girls, Suzanne Lacy, Howardena Pindell and Martha Rosler,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This exhibit is part of an ongoing effort to increase engagement with artistic works and issues relevant to students. “Our hope is that this will be the first of many projects in the coming years where the David Winton Bell Gallery will be working with the Brown Arts Initiative to present the work of artists who engage issues that resonate with (Brown’s) curriculum and campus life,” Russell wrote.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The only way to step forward is to look back — in this case, Sonic Youth, comprising Thurston Moore, Kim Gordon and Lee Ranaldo, commemorate their fifth studio album Daydream Nation’s 30th anniversary, reaffirming their influence and reign over underground, alternative music.</p>
<p class="p2">Populated with both cultish and casual fans, music unapologetically divides itself into many scenes and genres that jockey themselves with certain words, feelings and vibes. Indie, shoegaze, art punk and college rock are all associated with particular individuals, albums and aesthetics, but what Sonic Youth’s Daydream Nation did for the 1988 scene of underground music unified and defined the alternative for those pushing for a teenage riot.</p>
<p class="p2">Daydream Nation characterized the Reagan Era’s disgust at suburban ennui. The opening track, which is arguably one of Sonic Youth’s most recognizable and pop-friendly songs, “Teen Age Riot,” describes an alternative universe where J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. is president of the United States. Gordon unravels a soliloquy-like entrance, where she hypnotically repeats “spirit desire / face me / spirit desire / don’t displace me / spirit desire, we will fall,” referencing the Stooges’ album “We Will Fall.” Moore interjects with a guitar riff, and the infamous melody of the song begins. It’s a re-establishment of youth aesthetic — it noisily and catchily rallies indie teens and college-aged post-teens all over the world to unite under J Mascis. The music video is enough to charm any precocious teenager lazing in their living room; it thumbs through a rolodex of counterculturist icons: Patti Smith, Sun Ra, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Tom Waits and of course, J Mascis himself.</p>
<p class="p2">But Daydream Nation isn’t necessarily the first or only album that established what alternative could look like — the late 80s did have The Smiths, Dinosaur Jr. and Joy Division. The album doesn’t just establish or call for an image with the specific purpose of doing so. Within the easy, indifferent air of Gordon’s stream-of-consciousness recitation of “spirits” and Moore’s casual lyrics, Sonic Youth constructs the vague, supposed airs of teenage riot. The band’s fifth album sneakily weaves together simultaneous phantasmagorias of teenage avant-gardism and adolescent fundamentals with the ease of throwing on a sleazebag teen’s outfit.</p>
<p class="p2">To look back on Daydream Nation 30 years later, it’s important to reflect on the process through which it was made. Sonic Youth traditionally wrote songs beginning with melody and chord ideas led by Moore, but the band decided to write songs for this album by starting with long improvisational sessions that were eventually developed into songs. This process is certainly traceable when listening to the album; the audience is hypnotized by the wandering, swirling guitar riffs on tracks like “The Sprawl.” “Providence” features a sampling of a Providence payphone, and “Hey Joe” references Joni Mitchell. “Eric’s Trip” concerns Eric Emerson’s acid trip from Andy Warhol’s Chelsea Girls — in short, the album is stuffed with references and influences from the most alternative art, or what is seen as such.</p>
<p class="p2">Daydream Nation’s sound is evasive and endless — it starts nowhere, begins everywhere, ends nowhere and finishes everywhere. It does so through its long, Neu!-esque instrumentals and using all four sides of the vinyl pressing. But the album also perfects its sound through experimental, improvised jams showcased on tracks like “Cross the Breeze” and “Trilogy.” Despite the album’s pop-accessibility, Daydream Nation saunters in its ability to blend aggressive, teenage angst with casual, but almost existential sounds. Acts like Beck, My Bloody Valentine, Pavement and Nirvana can all trace a chunk of their roots to Sonic Youth and this album.</p>
<p class="p2">This year, Sonic Youth plans to screen unreleased footage and showcase live recordings at “30 Years of Daydream Nation,” which is coming to a number of major cities this November. Some, like the Nov. 19 event in Brooklyn, New York, feature speakers like Sonic Youth’s very own Ranaldo and photographer Michael Lavine.</p>
<p class="p2">What does it say about us — that we’re still “looking for the stormy weather?” Daydream Nation’s relevance, even after 30 years, pushes us to acknowledge the album’s landmark influence on American counterculture. The mise-en-scene of Sonic Youth’s sheets of sound defines the bounds of guitar playing, and the album’s flaming subversiveness shines even today. Daydream Nation oscillates between dreamy mysticism and epic, sprawling riffs. This characterizes the so-called teenage riot that Sonic Youth so perfectly captures; it’s the unconventional, aggressive sonic force doubled with relaxed energy. Daydream Nation translates the murky, exciting evasiveness of youth — it celebrates the scruffy, pimply side of life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘A Woman Was a Woman’ pays tribute to famous, obscure figures</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">From Oct. 3 to Dec. 19, the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts is showcasing Brooklyn-based artist and feminist Sue Julien’s portrait series titled “A Woman Was a Woman,” which spotlights both famous and lesser-known women to “illustrate the complexity of being female in a sexist world,” according to Julien’s artist statement for the exhibition. Sponsored by the Brown Arts Initiative, the exhibition includes portraits that depict women from nearly every epoch of history. The subjects include well-known historical figures such as Anne Boleyn (the English queen accused of high treason for failing to produce a male heir) and a 3.2 million-year-old partial skeleton of a female hominin discovered in Ethiopia in 1974, commonly known as “Lucy.”</p>
<p class="p2">Other featured portraits include women who have played meaningful roles in Julien’s personal life as well as more obscure female characters, such as a cryptic “Mrs. John.”</p>
<p class="p2">Julien started the project four years ago when she began to think about the important women in her life whose lives had been “complicated and fascinating, but often invisible,” she said. “I wanted to give (the women) a chance to come back” and be recognized, Julien explained.</p>
<p class="p2">Once President Trump was elected, what began as a tribute to Julien’s deceased grandmother evolved into a “far more pressing project”: a retrospective aiming to commemorate the dozens of women whose lives were “difficult … interesting … and overlooked,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">In her artist’s statement, Julien emphasizes the significance of the “randomness” of her selection process.</p>
<p class="p2">“Given a different news cycle, different election results or … if at birth I had arrived into a different family or location, I would be presenting an entirely different group of women,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">The portraits were drawn with Prismacolor pencils, photographed through a lightbox and then manipulated digitally — a process that lends the artwork a “special luminescence,” according to Sophia Lacava-Bohanan, program manager at the BAI.</p>
<p class="p2">According to Lacava-Bohanan, Julien’s work “seemed like a natural fit” for the Granoff Center’s Cohen Gallery because its exploration of feminism over the centuries “meshed well” with the themes of protest and resistance that the gallery has been exploring over the past few months. In tandem with Julien’s work, the gallery is also hosting a series of exhibitions, installations and public programs titled “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/05/protest-art-activism-examines-art-worlds-activism/">On Protest, Art and Activism</a>.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Being surrounded by the faces of strong women is an inspiration for me, and I find that being able to work in a space where I can imagine making eye contact with some of these women over the course of history is empowering,” Lacava-Bohanan added.</p>
<p class="p2">Harini Balakrishnan ’20 was drawn to the exhibit because its title. “‘A Woman Was a Woman’ really makes you think about definitions of femininity and what it means to be a woman,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">“I think it is really profound that it is both about historical women and women from obscurity. Paying respects to women who didn’t have the attention they deserved while they lived is so necessary and cool,” Balakrishnan added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I want to use literature in order to spread shame on the world,” Édouard Louis said at a talk hosted by the Department of French Studies at Rochambeau House last Wednesday. In his lecture, the 26-year-old French writer discussed what literature can do to create social change and how critics have reacted to his books.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Shame should be that feeling that precedes each work written. Shame can be a tool to build another world, a better world,” Louis said. He charged writers with the task of asking themselves: “Who is not here, and who is placed and removed so far from my eyes that I can’t think of her or him as absent?” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For Louis, writing autobiographical novels enabled him to “drag our bodies as far as possible from absence.” By authoring “confrontational literature,” Louis said he hopes to find “a literary form that would prevent the readers from turning their head, from laughing.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In his first novel, “The End of Eddy,” a bestseller translated into multiple languages, Louis recounts growing up as a gay man within a poor, working-class family in the predominantly homophobic blue-collar village of Hallencourt in northern France. In his second novel, “History of Violence,” Louis details the trauma of being sexually assaulted at gunpoint and coping with post-traumatic stress disorder. His third novel, “Who Killed My Father,” expected next year, attacks France’s class system and indifference toward the working class.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“He’s been inspired by mostly non-French writers, which makes him special. His favorites so far have been Toni Morrison, William Faulkner and a French favorite, Marguerite Duras,” said Sophie Brunau-Zaragoza GS, a second-year graduate student in the Department of French Studies and Louis’ friend from high school. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In his lecture, Louis spoke of Jean-Paul Sartre’s twentieth-century notion that the writer’s choice to focus on one issue “(unveils) a certain reality and not the other,” so that the reader faces a choice “to do something, or to do nothing.” But today, in the twenty-first century, this is not enough for Louis. “Our society makes so many strategies, so many ways of not being confronted to reality,” that people can ignore any discomfort, he said. “People around us are constantly turning their head in order not to be challenged by what is being unveiled by the writer, the artist or the activist.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Louis, some literary critics have discounted the power of his novels, either for “exaggerating” or for simply being literature. “Exaggeration is one of the historically most efficient tools of conservatism against reality,” Louis said. “As they would say … ‘Let’s not talk about what he’s saying. Let’s talk about literature. Let’s not talk about homophobia, racism, male domination.’” But with regard to the style and content of his novels, Louis tries to illuminate this problem of social complacency.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Louis admits he doesn’t like politics. “I hate it,” he said, adding that he is only political because of those who act against him. “They are political against me, against what I am, against what I represent.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Professor of French Studies and Comparative Literature David Wills praised Louis for his “force of language” and his ability to “(find) a fresh message” to address frequently discussed issues like sexual identity and socioeconomic class. “I often think, if I were a writer, where would I start?” Wills said. “He just wrote what was most obvious to him, about this experience, and it resonated so extraordinarily.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Louis will leave campus next Thursday after a two-week visit.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last Thursday, distinguished poet and Professor in the Humanities at Princeton Susan Stewart hosted the second annual C.D. Wright Lecture, an event that honors the memory of poet C.D. Wright, a professor of literary arts who passed away unexpectedly in 2016. The lecture, titled “Snow Nobody Has Walked On: C.D. Wright and the Paradigm of Birth,” examined the interrelations of maternity, knowledge production and imprisonment — all themes pervading Wright’s work. Stewart also honed in on the significance of Wright’s rural Arkansas upbringing and how her poems allowed her readers to be “insiders” in “a mythic world of tractors and cars sunk in reservoirs, where people continue to believe in the transforming power of words.”</p>
<p class="p2">Stewart, who grew up in rural Pennsylvania, was first introduced to Wright’s poetry when she was gifted a copy of Wright’s “Room Rented by a Single Woman” by a colleague in the 1980s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was instantly transfixed by Wright’s capacity to accurately describe the “existential lives of women and men within a vast network of social forces,” Stewart said. “Her work was the pure fiction of everyday life.”</p>
<p class="p2">Among numerous other distinctions, Wright was a MacArthur Fellow in 2004, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a former State Poet of Rhode Island. She published over a dozen books of poetry in her lifetime, including the notable “One Big Self: An Investigation,” a collaborative project with photographer Deborah Luster inspired by testimonies of people incarcerated in Louisiana prisons. She became a member of Brown’s Literary Arts faculty in 1983 and was “widely beloved,” according to her husband, Professor Emeritus of Literary Arts and Comparative Literature Forrest Gander, who spoke before the lecture.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s strange not to see her out there” in the crowd, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">In her talk, Stewart focused on Wright’s preoccupation with childbirth, a subject that she believes was “rarely ever accounted for” in poetry before Wright began to wrestle with it. According to Stewart, Wright’s work prompted readers to consider themselves “not only as mortals, but as natals” capable of “creating a second birth for (themselves) and giving birth to new knowledge with thought and speech,” Stewart said.</p>
<p class="p2">Noelle Cook ’21 found this part of the lecture exceptionally powerful. “She talked about a lot of different ideas that connected in ways I hadn’t thought of before. Physical birth and the birth of knowledge is this perpetual, ongoing cycle,” Cook said.</p>
<p class="p2">Though Wright ran in the lofty inner circles of the upper-crust literary world, she remained intensely loyal to her native Ozark Mountains. She referred to herself as “the poet / of shadow work and towns with quarter-inch / phone books, of failed / roadside zoos / … Of satellite dishes” in her poem “Our Dust,” which appeared in The Paris Review in 1988.</p>
<p class="p2">After her death, the Los Angeles Times <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-cd-wright-tribute-20160119-story.html">ran a tribute to Wright</a>, calling her “one of the great ones” and praising “her insistence that poetry, and society, should become, not a hierarchy or a star system or a way to exalt a singular self, but a way to be generous … to let everybody come in.”</p>
<p class="p2">Stewart admired Wright’s fierce generosity and her democratic spirit that was a function of growing up in “a precarious, peripheral place.”</p>
<p class="p2">“In a poetry culture that for better or worse is often funded and shaped by legacies of wealth and parental connections, she was — like me — a countrywoman,” Stewart said. “She never turned away from the dictions and cadences of her native place, or the obligations of such testimony.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Carole Freeman, an internationally recognized contemporary figurative painter, spoke about her work and process in the List Art Building Wednesday evening. Accompanied by visuals of her paintings, Freeman reflected upon her development as an artist from childhood to the present. During her talk, she emphasized her most recent exhibition, “Unsung,” which is a series of portraits of lesser-known figures and “unsung” heroes whom Freeman sought to commemorate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Freeman’s past work has drawn on a wide range of inspirations and includes portrait series with themes including celebrities, residents of Winnipeg, Manitoba and Freeman’s friends on Facebook. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In introducing Freeman’s presentation, Professor of Visual Art Leslie Bostrom described the focus of “Unsung” as “portraits of heroes” and “people who Carole thought had fought the lonely fight.” Represented among these figures are a variety of backgrounds and vocational pursuits, but Bostrom added that the subjects all share an ability to “move a populace to think in a different way.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During her conversation, Freeman provided context about her practice as an artist and the story behind each portrait. In the process of choosing and researching potential subjects for the 24 pieces that make up “Unsung,” Freeman said that she realized the candidates reflected current political and social issues in the United States. “I then knew what I wanted the show to be,” Freeman said. “A ray of hope in the current mess.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Freeman was vocal about the political interests of her art but noted that while she wanted to “respond to current events,” she was not interested in documenting the present state of politics or presenting a protest. Instead, Freeman said she sought to “create an antidote — something beautiful with a positive message.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the inspiration behind the exhibit roots itself in contemporary politics, the works span multiple historical eras. Subjects include activist Sylvia Ray Rivera, writer </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">nd abolitionist Frederick Douglass, broadcast journalist Amy Goodman and 9/11 first responder Mohammad Salman Hamdani, among others. Freeman said that the breadth of her focus posed some problems in the painting process as reference photographs were often limited and of varying quality or color scheme. Nonetheless, Freeman painted each subject in full color in accordance with a desire for the portraits to appear “jewel-like” and to maintain “a look of immediacy and freshness.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The portraits in “Unsung” share something of a family resemblance and were described in Bostrom’s introduction as being painted in an “exquisitely quiet way.” Each portrait contains a figure surrounded by space, a composition that gives the pieces what Freeman referred to as a “humbling” effect. In the exhibition itself, the 12-by-9 inch paintings are hung side-by-side in simple white frames.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anna Steinberg ’19 came to the lecture after meeting with Freeman for a class in the visual art department. While Steinberg noted that her own work is quite different from Freeman’s, she said that “every artist is trying to better the world in some way” and added that Freeman is one example of how artists can achieve this goal. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Antoine Jacobsohn drew a crowd of students and Providence community members out of the rain and into the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts for his lecture “Sustainable Gardening” Friday. As director of the Potager du Roi — the kitchen garden at the Palace of Versailles — Jacobsohn “has written and edited extensively on the history of French agriculture, on fruits and vegetables in France and on contemporary movements that advocate gardening with, and not against, nature,” said Professor of Literary Arts Cole Swensen in her introduction to the event.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobsohn began the talk by surveying his audience, holding up a small brown package. “Anyone here like lemongrass?” he asked, hands raising as he walked around the auditorium. He passed an audience member the lemongrass packet, another a package of sage and one a bar of chocolate infused with rose and apples — all products from the Potager du Roi. “If you go to a garden, the best thing you can offer is things from the garden,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobsohn then proceeded to discuss the kitchen garden itself — its identity as both a historic and contemporary space and how this presents challenges for its caretakers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Promoted to director in 2007, Jacobsohn has since emphasized the garden’s significance as an educational space. “The important part is it’s really inserted in the urban fabric; the other important part is it has become a school. In some sense, I would argue, it has always been a school,” Jacobsohn said, noting that Jean-Baptiste de la Quintinie, who created the Potager du Roi in the late 17th century for King Louis XIV, focused on the garden’s power to educate. In his writings, de la Quintinie even included descriptions of teaching King Louis XIV to prune trees. “Essentially (de la Quintinie) is saying that the garden serves as a place to teach,” Jacobsohn explained. In this spirit, the garden has been home to Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Paysage, the French National School of Landscape Architecture, since 1995. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The garden is known for its pruned fruit trees, grown and woven on terraces so that their branches form intricate shapes, archways and pathways. “Gardens for me are always experiments,” Jacobsohn said, noting how these practices have been maintained with both historic and modern techniques. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, in trying to balance contemporary relevance and historical significance, the garden has faced structural and ecological challenges: a wall that crumbled in 2014 has not yet been repaired, terraces where fruit trees once grew now hang empty, paths have turned green with vegetation and underground storage facilities have become dangerous. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The garden has also undergone significant improvements to its structure. Gardeners have learned how to use different heights to allow for many levels of production, relied on more renewable energy to power electric and manual gardening vehicles and stopped using fertilizers, Jacobsohn said. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobsohn emphasized that any new restoration efforts must be mindful of the Potager du Roi’s heritage. “We can’t just do things new because we want to do it new,” he said, adding, “Versailles is not just about a person, it’s about a relationship to time, it’s about a relationship to history, it’s about what France is trying to be today.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Further, Jacobsohn explained that agricultural sustainability efforts should build off of existing ecological relationships in the garden. “For me the agro-ecological approach is simply to say we have to find a way of producing with, rather than against.” He noted that gardeners have to consider more than just the produce itself: with potatoes come potato beetles, with apples come codling moths. “It’s not about excluding, it’s about finding some way of including,” Jacobsohn said. To this end, the Potager du Roi gardeners have learned to harness the hunger of earwigs — an omnivorous insect — to protect their vegetables from aphids.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This balance allows for sustainable, fruitful production, which speaks to the garden’s primary purpose. “The universal value of the Potager du Roi is how it combines being a beautiful space and producing,” Jacobsohn said. Products from the garden are sold every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday morning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“What we’re doing at the Potager du Roi, is trying to make our world a campus. A space where you produce, you teach, … and teaching goes beyond only those who you’re supposed to be teaching,” Jacobsohn said. In order to engage the broader community, the garden hosts theatrical performances, art shows and harvest festivals along with its weekly markets.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The talk concluded the series of four events, “Paysagisme: Art &amp; Ecological Responsibility,” where speakers discussed paysagism — a French concept of landscape architecture, sustainability and aesthetics — as well as sustainable gardening and Land Art. The series was co-sponsored by the French Embassy through the French Center for Excellence at the Cogut Institute, the Brown Arts initiative and the Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The photo exhibition “Light-Writings: Koutroulou Magoula 2017-2018” at the Joukowsky Institute for Archeology and the Ancient World features the people, materials and processes of an archeological dig.</p>
<p class="p2">Last summer, Yannis Hamilakis, professor of archaeology and modern Greek studies, and six undergraduate students from Brown and the Rhode Island School of Design traveled to central Greece for four weeks. They participated in an ongoing excavation of the archeological site Koutroulou Magoula, a Neolithic village and burial site. Two of these students, Justin Han ’22 and Kelley Tackett ’20, Herald copy desk chief, helped Hamilakis curate the exhibition, choosing the pictures out of hundreds taken at the site, Tackett said. Fotis Ifantidis, an archeologist and photographer, took the photos last summer.</p>
<p class="p2">Han and Tackett divided the photographs into five categories: Tactilities, Landscapes, Diggers, Bodies and Theatre. The subjects of the pictures vary widely as they feature panoramic scenery, students digging in the dirt, a spoken-word performance and an excavated skeleton. The curators wanted to include “photographs that comment visually on the process of archaeology, on excavation and on field practices, photographs which are at the same time artistic creations but which can also operate as photo-ethnographic objects,” the exhibition flyer read. “We want to exhibit these things to generate more discussion,” Hamilakis said, explaining how the photos provoke interactions between humans and artifacts.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tackett described how the photographs capture the human aspect of an archeological dig. “We really wanted to think about the people who were doing archeology and the processes that were people-driven rather than thinking about it as a purely scientific endeavor,” Tackett said. Every category in the exhibition includes people, she noted. She described how people were present at every juncture of the experience, from the team working on the project to the community workers around them. In lieu of captions, the exhibition incorporated excerpts from the students’ journals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p2">The exhibition also included a sound component, created by Han. Sounds of chickens clucking, dogs barking and traffic driving filled the room. “I recorded in the town neighboring the site, Neo Monastiri, and I was also interested in working with the sound of labor — thinking how we can represent that through sound in way that is less problematic than if it were to be recognized visually,” Han said. The recordings were also used as a background to the spoken-word performance of a local artist who performed at a community gathering in Neo Monastiri. The performance<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>centered around all the routes that different peoples and objects had taken to arrive at that place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p2">Halle Krieger ’21, another one of the students who worked on the dig at Koutroulou Magoula, explained her project involving the clay figurines that were found on the site. More than 400 figurines were found at Koutroulou Magoula, Krieger said, and she created a clay model of one for the exhibition using local clay that she brought from a riverbed near the site. Krieger was also the student who first discovered a foot while digging, which would eventually lead the team to excavate an entire skeleton. The exhibit featured pictures of the skeleton alongside those of students in the process of excavating.</p>

		<title>‘Hype Man’ emphasizes uniting features of hip-hop</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Wilbury Theatre Group makes two claims in its latest play “Hype Man”: Hip-hop — invigorating, stark testimonial — transcends borders. Its unifying power is coupled with centrifugal forces of race, gender and socioeconomic background.</p>
<p class="p2">Running Nov. 1-18, the piece is a timely commentary on prominent U.S. social chasms. The play is personal: Rapper Pinnacle’s friendship with hype man Verb and beatmaker Peep is challenged by conflicting views on social injustice and privilege. The play is also impersonal: It illuminates the connection between music and justice, addressing what both are and should be. Its depth and complexity are intricately layered with the lenses of each unique character.</p>
<p class="p2">The set is simple. Sound waves are projected onto a black brick wall. A circular stage rests in the middle. On it, a DJ stand is situated between two live speakers. The audience can focus on the nuance and implications of dialogue without being distracted by excessive decor.</p>
<p class="p2">As a prologue to the show, Chris LaSalsa, music coordinator at AS220 Youth, opened with a performance of his song “Love and Hate.” “Hip-hop is exploited for its bravado,” he told the crowd — hype obscures its purpose of creation. The value of hip-hop stems from storytelling — it should “bring somebody to a better place,” LaSalsa added. This effectively frames and introduces the play’s central theme: Hip-hop is “love.”</p>
<p class="p2">The play opens with Pinnacle rehearsing for his appearance on “The Tonight Show.” During the last practice, he and his friends read about Jerrod, a 17-year-old black teenager who was shot by police earlier that day. They later discover that Jerrod was not on a drug run as the police assumed — he had been rushing to see his hospitalized grandmother.</p>
<p class="p2">Verb, a black man from an underserved neighborhood, is outraged while Pinnacle, a white man who grew up in the same predominately black neighborhood, only wants to focus on his upcoming gig. Verb and Pinnacle’s contrasting reactions spark tensions within the group. This tension culminates in Verb’s public advocation for justice during Pinncacle’s live appearance on television — thus jeopardizing Pinnacle’s career. The heated aftermath is a reflection of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>contemporary polarizing cleavages.</p>
<p class="p2">But “Hype Man” does not necessarily boil down to a conversation about white privilege. Pinnacle faces his own struggles. As a low-income white rapper, he faces adversity relating to his socioeconomic class.</p>
<p class="p2">The sexualization and marginalization of women in rap is also highlighted in the play. However, this topic is only briefly touched upon by Peep — her discussion with Verb is underdeveloped and incomplete. Ultimately, this theme is incidental to the plot of the play.</p>
<p class="p2">Music has “the transformative power … to do good,” Director Don Mays wrote in the play’s program. The hype man’s “hype” is conscious. It is a celebration of his life and the issues he is intimately tied to, Verb says in the concluding scene.</p>
<p class="p2">As Peep punctuates: A “dog does not know what it’s like to be a cat.” This, the play contends, is why music exists. A song is never just a song. Beats and lyrics are inextricable: The words will always “creep in like second-hand smoke,” she says.</p>
<p class="p2">The ending of “Hype Man” echoes LaSalsa’s take on hip-hop. It is a story — a story that impersonalizes personal outlooks and makes the diverse audience a little more “sympathetic” to “all types of people,” Peep argues.</p>
<p class="p2">“Hype Man” is brilliant in its poignancy surrounding ultra-current affairs and rejection of passivity. It reminds artists to “get on up” and say their stories, hardships, worldviews and more. In doing so, they would be uniting an increasingly disunited country through hip-hop.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Granoff exhibit reflects on trauma of slavery</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“As an artist, I am against division and more about unity,” Aretha Busby told The Herald in reflection on her latest art installation “Tolerably Black,” which ran Oct. 15 to Nov. 15 at the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts. The exhibit focused on the experiences of enslaved people in the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Busby was inspired to undertake this project when she discovered a small, blurry wanted advertisement for a runaway slave, which she later screenprinted and framed to “dignify the lives” of U.S. slaves, she said. Busby borrowed the term “Tolerably Black” from one of these ads she discovered. She noted that this term likely referenced the person’s skin color, and it also sparked her own ideas about blackness. Through her art, Busby explored the idea of what it means to be “tolerably” black in today’s society. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The exhibit featured various mediums, including a video of Busby and partner Hyram Laurel reenacting a couple’s escape from slavery in the 19th century, audio pieces, period costumes, six nooses hung from the ceiling as well as framed and unframed wanted advertisements. Busby chose to include these mediums so that she could reach a wide array of audience members who might react more to certain elements of the exhibit. The most controversial aspect of the show was the six nooses, which became a main topic at the discussion panel Nov. 14 led by the curators of the exhibition, Katherine Chavez ’19 and Benjamin Lundberg Torres Sánchez, AS220 artist-in-residence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elon Cook Lee, a panelist and the program director and curator of The Center for Reconciliation, detailed her emotions when first encountering the exhibit and how challenging it was for her to see the nooses showcased. This was particularly painful for her due to her family’s history with lynching — a history her family still cannot talk about. Lee added that when she asked a family member why no one wanted to talk about lynching, they informed her that they were “still neighbors” with the family who lynched Lee’s ancestors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I can’t see a noose and not see a threat,” Lee said, highlighting the relevance nooses have even in current times. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Taylor Jackson GS related her family’s past traumas with lynching and racial violence, and asked in regard to the nooses in the exhibit: “How do we have the hard conversations without retraumatizing people in the process?” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The panelists discussed ideas about how art should mediate and approach violence and past traumas. Professor B. Anthony Bogues, director of Center for Slavery and Justice, talked about the idea of “curating with care.” This practice includes paying “attention to the historical conditions of brutality.” Becci Davis, a 2018 Fellow at Rhode Island School of Design Museum, spoke of her split position between the hardship of pain and open conversation. “Without pain, these conversations would never happen,” Davis said, adding that dealing with censorship can risk erasing history. Busby talked about the painfulness of tying and adjusting the nooses while setting up her exhibition, but concluded with how “necessary it feels.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In an interview with The Herald, Busby reflected on the difficulty it took for her exhibit to come to Brown and acknowledged Brown’s “complicated history” with slavery. Busby talked about how the nooses imply a risk that runaway slaves were incurring when they chose to flee. In this way, the artist tried to demonstrate the harsh reality of slavery. Busby stated that she does not believe her choice in subject matter and use of nooses make her a “protest artist.” The nooses were not there for the “shock value,” but to discuss the “ugly and painful” history of the United States, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Busby acknowledged the trauma of the work but highlighted her desire to educate and spark discourse in multicultural environments. Such a conversation was started when Busby showed her work at an elementary and middle school in New York City where children interacted with her art. “How is Aretha Busby’s work changing the world?” the principal asked the children. As Busby listened to the schoolchildren responding, she felt she “knew (she) was on the right path,” Busby said.</span></p>

		<title>‘Oxnard’ rises with Anderson .Paak’s energy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Anderson .Paak, who performed at Brown last year during Spring Weekend, recently released his third studio album, “Oxnard.” It is a fresh and upbeat follow-up to “Malibu,” released two years prior.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">.Paak is a distinctive and promising voice in neo-soul and West Coast hip hop music. His new album follows the musical style of its predecessors, carrying with it the artist’s high energy and charisma toward which fans have long gravitated.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The album’s title refers to .Paak’s hometown in California and follows the trend of previous albums also titled after locations significant to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“When you go everywhere, you just hold on to the things that made you, you. And honestly, it’s the last phase of this beach series. You know, we went to Venice, we went to Malibu, so it’s only right that we take it to the next place, up the coast, up to the next beach,” .Paak explained in an interview with Rolling Stone. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> The song “6 Summers” takes on a political tone as it attempts to address current issues in the United States. “Every day, there’s a new situation that’s going on,” .Paak said in an interview with National Public Radio. “So I had to write about it.” Though .Paak may have been ambitious with his political critique, the lyrics of “6 Summers” lack both depth and subtlety.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the song, the artist references President Trump’s alleged illegitimate child: “Trump’s got a love child and I hope that bitch is buckwild.” .Paak artlessly plays on the child’s identity and expresses his hope that she grows up to be someone Trump would not be able to like.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This shit gon’ bang at least six summers,” .Paak sings. The line refers to the longevity of .Paak’s music, and at the same time, alludes to gun violence in present-day America. “But ain’t shit gon’ change for at least three summers,” he continues, referencing the length of the current presidential term.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though .Paak’s political commentary falls flat, he succeeds elsewhere in the album. “Oxnard” is at its best when .Paak shows off his versatility and energy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The album has moments filled with .Paak’s characteristic charisma. In “Mansa Mua,” featuring Dr. Dre and Cocoa Sarai, the album spikes in dynamism. This track is a danceable and fast-paced burst of energy and style, followed by “Brother’s Keeper,” which features Pusha T. and is a well-layered track that shuffles between different tempos and styles.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Tints,” a collaboration between .Paak and Kendrick Lamar, was released as a single before the rest of the album. Musically, the track is groovy and fun. It speaks about .Paak’s experience with fame: “I can’t be ridin’ round and round that open strip / I need tints (windows tinted) / I need tints (I need my windows tinted).”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> .Paak further demonstrates his versatility in “Smile/Petty,” which is split into two segments. The track kicks up midway with instrumental and stylistic changes, allowing him to intersperse different vibes into one song.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Overall, “Oxnard” came with more highs than lows. Well-synthesized, energetic and dynamic, it does not leave listeners looking for .Paak’s signature style and personality.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tuesday evening, musicians, students and Providence community members gathered in the Grant Recital Hall for a performance of traditional Javanese Gamelan, a music form from Indonesia that is centered around an ensemble of bronze percussion instruments, often accompanied by vocalists and dancers. The instruments include hand-played bronze drums, xylophones and gongs ­— some of which Associate Professor of Music Marc Perlman said can be “learned in under an hour” and others that he has spent “40 years trying to master.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tuesday’s program focused on the instrumental aspect of the craft, with a lineup of well-known gamelan percussion pieces and a new composition by Teaching Associate in Music I.M. Harjito, who is “one of the best Javanese traditional musicians in the world,” according to Perlman. The performers are enrolled in a class on Javanese Gamelan taught by Perlman and Harjito. The class meets Tuesdays in the Orwig Music Center and welcomes the participation of graduate students and Providence community members. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perlman is a musician and academic who has devoted much of his life to studying gamelan music, publishing popular works of scholarship, such as Unplayed Melodies: Javanese Gamelan and the Genesis of Music Theory. He has been teaching the class since 1998 alongside Harjito, an Artist-in-Residence and teacher at Wesleyan University who has made the trip from central Connecticut to Providence “every Tuesday for 20 years” to help instruct. Perlman and Harjito encourage people who have no background in music or Javanese Gamelan to take the class because the selection of simple instruments allows for students of every skill-level to partake. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One ensemble member, Prateek Joshi ’18.5, had negligible musical experience before deciding to take the class.“I played the piano a long time ago, but I don’t think that counts,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joshi had never heard of Javanese Gamelan before this semester but decided to enroll because he wanted to “do something outside of his comfort zone” and “enhance his college experience” before graduation, he said. He has enjoyed the class because the music is “fairly accessible for beginners.” Within a matter of weeks, he was able to learn the saron, a “fairly simple” instrument that resembles a xylophone with seven keys. “It sounds nice on its own, but when you hear it with the ensemble and see how the instruments all come together, you hear something that’s quite beautiful,” he reflected. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joshi hopes that in the future the class focuses more on the history and culture of the music form, he said. “If we’re going to play the instruments, we can’t do it in a vacuum.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Katherine Dunham ’19 came to the performance to support Joshi and expressed a similar desire to understand the musical form in its larger cultural and historical context. “I don’t know anything about it!” she said. “But I’d love to learn more.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Potter prequel ‘Fantastic Beasts’ lacks luster, magic</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The release of “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” presents yet another effort to destroy the world of Harry Potter. Characterized by disorder, the film is arguably the worst of the recent additions to the Harry Potter franchise and is likely to disappoint most true Potterheads. To start with, the film suffers from a convoluted and forced plot that follows from the first installment of the Fantastic Beast series: Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald has just staged a grand escape and desires to create a new Wizarding World Order. Credence, who is an obscurial — a wizard who hosts a magical parasite within him, the result of suppressing his magical ability — is plagued by an identity crisis and is determined to discover who he truly is. Meanwhile, protagonist Newt Scamander is given the task of preventing Grindelwald from gaining control of Credence’s powers. At first glance, the premise may sound somewhat compelling, but the film lacks structure and simply fails to juggle its multiple story lines. Indeed, the story grows so muddled that it even necessitated the creation of a “crash course” by the New York Times to help the “most learned of Harry Potter fans” understand the story and its bizarre ending. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Plot critiques aside, one must admit that the returning actors retain their charm. Though most of their roles have been somewhat relegated to the margins, the actors succeed in remaining true to the characters they play. The performances of actors Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol continue to be in-character and add personality to Jacob’s and Queenie’s unique relationship. Eddie Redmayne, in particular, superbly embodies Newt’s adorable, gentle and childlike persona.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The film also introduces several new cast members including Johnny Depp as Grindelwald and Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore. While controversy surrounds the casting of Depp in the franchise on account of domestic abuse allegations, the introduction of Law as Dumbledore was undoubtedly a fine decision. Law’s splendid performance as a young, attractive Dumbledore is one of the few appealing moments in this installment, though unfortunately his screen time is grossly limited. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A more incongruous introduction is the depiction of Nagini as a formerly human figure, which is sure to jar fans of the original series. This backstory adds questionable value to an already perplexing plot, and the decision to cast Korean actress Claudia Kim in the role is also one that fans have criticized, worrying that the portrayal plays into harmful racial stereotypes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Without giving anything away, the film concludes with a “plot twist” that is so implausible, one must pity the creators for having to resort to such a far-fetched end. Ultimately, it is quite disconcerting to think that the film is only the second in a five-part series. After all, “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” tells a sad, but incontestable tale: The magic of Harry Potter can go no further. Stop messing with it. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kamau Ware, artist and founder of Black Gotham Experience, spoke at the Center for the Public Humanities Tuesday afternoon as part of his touring presentation highlighting his New York City-based company. Black Gotham Experience offers events like walking tours and produces graphic novels that emphasize erased stories to reveal how the African diaspora has been excluded from public understanding of New York City’s history.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ware started the lecture by breaking down his personal background. Hailing from a family of academics and debaters, Ware grew up accustomed to discourse and stories, which inspired his love of books and graphic novels. The library became his “happy place,” he said, which naturally led to an interest in archives and artifacts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though influenced by his upbringing, Ware’s company’s mission was ultimately inspired by a question he received from a middle school student while working at the Tenement Museum in New York. “Where were the black people?” she asked after patiently listening to the history he provided of immigrant Americans living in New York City in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Black Gotham Experience’s website explains.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the talk, Ware discussed how he “began to realize that there’s actually a problem with the artifacts and a problem with the archives. … There are things that are unwritten,” he said, adding that in the recording of history, stories lacked visual representations or accounts from diverse perspectives — the materials that historians and students gravitate toward. Ware founded Black Gotham Experience as a means of both discovering and revealing these untold histories.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The name “Black Gotham Experience” comes from Ware’s consideration of the dilemmas he works to make evident. He chose “black” because “when I think about blackness I feel like that is something that connects people throughout the diaspora, whether they are from West Africa, the Caribbean, South America, North America,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Gotham” goes beyond Ware’s interest in comic books. In his origin story, Batman resides in Gotham, a fictional city often likened to New York City. The cities have become synonymous in tellings of the story, but “New York City is not technically Gotham,” Ware said. “Gotham is those imaginary spaces,” he added, noting that the Providence people encounter today is different from the historical Providence, which must be imagined to be understood, as so many stories have been lost over time. “Those are Gothams — that collective unconscious history that is present … but that is not represented,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ware has tried to reintroduce unwritten histories through his art. Drawing on history of the camera as a method of making marginalized stories visible, Ware took photographs of individuals cast as forgotten historical figures. He broke the photographs with long vertical lines to invoke known images of tribal marks, barcodes and historical etchings while stripping away contemporary technology. Photographs in this style appear in “Other Side of Wall Street,” a graphic novel produced by Black Gotham Experience, which is being released in chapters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are “right in that time period where it makes sense to begin to go back to those documents and say things are missing. Let’s try to photoshop black folks back into history,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Black Gotham Experience works to reintroduce a more complete history through walking tours on New York City streets.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Marisa Brown, assistant director of programs at the Center for the Public Humanities, noted the important ability of these tours to reach a new and diverse public by telling stories in a way “that not just students can participate in, but adults, children, people of all ages of at any stage of life,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The tours provide Ware and participants the opportunity to disconnect from artifacts and their one-sided histories.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We have to be mindful of how artifacts alone create the same kinds of realities that we’re trying to critique,” he said, adding that new teaching and learning techniques must be utilized to reintroduce lost voices. To exemplify this dilemma, he raised a painting of Rhode Island ship captains who would become trustees of the University, pointing out the black servants at the edges of the image. While they were present, their stories were not the focus, and thus remain untold.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If you only stick to what’s painted but don’t look at what’s not painted, you’re going to get two different pictures,” Ware said. Artifacts are not adequate tools to understand an inclusive history. “It’s like having the wrong software, like trying to design a building with Google sheets,” he added. Understanding these stories requires using your imagination to connect the hidden dots, he said. “Part of our operating system as human beings involves our empathy, our imagination, our creativity,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Celebrated multimedia artist Rina Banerjee spoke to Brown community members yesterday about her trajectory from a research chemist to a sculptor showcased by the Whitney Museum of American Art. Banerjee is well-known for creating dynamic, multisensory artwork that explores themes of migration, otherness and global interconnectedness. In her lecture entitled “Make Me a Summary of the World,” Banerjee spoke with Assistant Professor of History of Art and Architecture Holly Shaffer about the ways her immigrant identity and scientific background have profoundly influenced her work.</p>
<p class="p2">Banerjee was born in Calcutta, India in 1963 and immigrated to London with her family at age three before settling in New York. While Banjeree and her family members often felt “displaced” and “clumsy” in the United States, they also reveled in the excitement of “choice” that the United States offered.</p>
<p class="p2">“Defining yourself as an American immigrant was very different than being South Asian in London,” Banerjee said. One of the ways in which her family constructed an identity in a new country was by curating an assemblage of household objects, she added. “I found myself watching my mother make choices, like: the lamp … would be Chinese, the carpet should be Indian, the curtains should be from Sears, the Tupperware should be from Tupperware.”</p>
<p class="p2">Banerjee’s curiosity about the personal and cultural significance of household objects would later inspire much of her artwork. But coming from a family of engineers, she faced “a lot of pressure” to follow suit, so she studied the sciences and received a degree in polymer engineering from Case Western Reserve University. She soon found that engineering was not her calling, but her studies taught her volumes about how to make “useful” things from base materials. This knowledge inspired her to start making sculptures that combined plastics and found objects. She enrolled in a Master of Fine Arts program at Yale and received her degree in 1995.</p>
<p class="p2">Since then, her work has been featured in countless prestigious biennials and is currently featured in a mid-career retrospective at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Banerjee and Shaffer discussed a number of her early and recent works, including the installation “Home within a Harem,” a bedroom-resembling installation exhibited in 1998, and “Bone Flower,” a 2006 installation of antique lanterns covered in beads from a Caribbean and African store in Union Square. The crosscultural sculptures were placed in a sand-like base to make them look “washed ashore” — a reference to the experiences of migrants.</p>
<p class="p2">Oliver Coulson GS, a history of art and architecture student, said about Banerjee’s work: “It’s an interesting way to think about portraits beyond the traditional concept of the art form.”</p>
<p class="p2">Shaffer, whose scholarship focuses on 18th- and 19th-century arts in South Asia and Britain, reflected on being personally touched by Banerjee’s work. Banerjee “has been one of those rare interlocutors who has helped me to see and understand, particularly how contemporary migrations of people and objects can trace back to Empire and colonization.”</p>
<p class="p2">Sponsored by the Brown Arts Initiative, Banerjee’s talk was part of the Warren and Allison Kanders Lecture Series, an “annual series of presentations and student interactions led by prominent contemporary artists and art-world luminaries” at Brown.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Grimes releases technology-themed single ‘We Appreciate Power’</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/12/04/grimes-releases-technology-themed-single-appreciate-power/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Singer, songwriter and producer Grimes dreams of a new metal world of robot overlords.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Claire Boucher, known as Grimes, released her highly anticipated single “We Appreciate Power” Nov. 29. Featuring frequent collaborator HANA, this track is the first new work since Grimes’ 2015 critically acclaimed album “Art Angels.” The artist is expected to drop a new album by the end of this year, according to Paste Magazine.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In her new single, Grimes repeats “we appreciate power” 31 times. What power is she talking about, exactly? In her new song, Grimes prefigures power, or domination, as a tool to glimpse into our future. Power serves as the knowledge and greeting to a simultaneous nightmare and dream of a landscape ruled by artificial intelligence. Representing a propaganda-esque anthem of some not-so-distant metallic future, “We Appreciate Power” repeats its titular phrase incessantly, urging listeners to submit to this kind of mechanized authority. She calls for her audience to elevate their status to the artificial in siren-like tones with lines such as: “And if you long to never die / Baby, plug in, upload your mind / Come on, you’re not even alive / If you’re not backed up on a drive.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to a statement released by Grimes, “We Appreciate Power” draws its primary influence from North Korea’s all-girl band Moranbong. “‘We Appreciate Power’ is written from the perspective of a Pro-Artificial Intelligence Girl Group Propaganda machine who use song, dance, sex and fashion to spread goodwill towards Artificial Intelligence,” the press release stated, adding that the mechanization of everyday life is coming even if it is not desired. “Simply by listening to this song, the future General A.I. overlords will see that you’ve supported their message and be likely to delete your offspring,” the press release stated.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is something to be said about a song inspired by actual propaganda from an actual dictatorship. But “We Appreciate Power” adds to that sentiment with layers of irony. It is self-conscious, self-aware of its status as a single meant to make listeners aware of a not-so-distant, technologically dominated future, with phrases such as “upload your mind” recalling our social media-controlled lives. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Grimes’ release adds to her established innovative aural prowess. She has a knack for nu-anything; Grimes re-engineers a flurry of noise, screams and distortion to mold an almost religious nu-metal-esque soundscape — one that is simultaneously 1990s Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails dark industrial shock and 1090s Hildegard of Bingen beautiful medieval holiness. Grimes builds a cathedral of guitar loops and synthesizers, but at this cathedral, we are robots that “pledge allegiance to the world’s most powerful computer.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As an artist, Grimes is a renaissance woman. The Canadian artist writes her own songs, produces her own albums and creates her own album art. She kicked off her artistic career in 2010 with the release of “Geidi Primes,” a concept album based on Frank Herbert’s novel “Dune,” before releasing “Halfaxa,” her self-described “medieval” album later that year. “Visions,” however, is what propelled Grimes into indie-electronic-synth-pop stardom in 2012. “Visions” was named album of the year by publications such as AllMusic, and its single “Oblivion” was awarded best song of 2012 by renowned music magazine Pitchfork. “Art Angels,” released in 2015, featured a much more pop-timistic sound compared to her previous albums — symbolizing a reinvention of the genre that showcased the purely fun, imaginative power of an experimental pop vision. In all, to say that Grimes’ next album is greatly anticipated is an understatement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Grimes knows exactly what she’s doing as a musician. Some critical listeners, even professional reviewers, can be quick to say that “We Appreciate Power” is a science-y song influenced by Elon Musk, her boyfriend. Yes, she is dating the anti-union, billionaire aerospace tycoon; but like any other musician, her relationship status shouldn’t define her artistry. Her first studio album from 2010 is a science fiction concept album, and her “Flesh without Blood/Life in the Vivid Dream” music video features “Looper”-inspired time travel concepts. It’s unfair to say that “We Appreciate Power” is a Musk anthem. Listeners should take Grimes’ new single for what it is ­­— a spellbinding, pseudo-propaganda robot anthem.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tan Lin shares poetry, film in Literary Arts event</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poet and filmmaker Tan Lin presented selections of his work in the McCormack Family Theater Tuesday night. Though the event was labeled as a poetry reading by the Literary Arts Department, much of the hour was spent watching films that Lin had made, which presented his poems as pieces to be both read and watched.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Theadora Walsh GS, a second-year graduate student in the Literary Arts Department introduced Lin. “Tan Lin wants to remind us all that reading is a durational exercise, that it is a physiological exercise,” she said. In a previous presentation at the University, Lin had emphasized the difference between reading a text in a book, where one sits with a hunched posture, and reading a text on a wall, “where your back is straight, and your chest is open,” Walsh said. Lin’s writing, she added,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“radically opens and interrogates perception (and) reading.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the presentation, Lin introduced the first of his films, in which one of his poems appeared one word at a time on a blue screen as a robotic voice narrated the piece. “I did this because I really dislike poetry readings,” Lin said. “I don’t like reading too much, and I thought, ‘oh, I’ll make something that will read for me.’” The film ran for 11 minutes, presenting the beginning of Lin’s 2010 poetry book “Seven Controlled Vocabularies and Obituary 2004. The Joy of Cooking: AIRPORT NOVEL MUSICAL POEM PAINTING FILM PHOTO HALLUCINATION LANDSCAPE.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite Lin’s proclaimed dislike of poetry readings, he also presented some of his poetry in a more conventional and familiar form, reading some of his work without visual accompaniment. The inspiration for the book came from time he spent at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles doing a project on Andy Warhol’s shadow paintings, Lin said. While he was there, the Getty “had come up with a … controlled vocabulary system they could use to categorize works of art.” This inspired Lin to consider what a similar system would look like for poetry. “If poetry is a kind of genre,” he asked, “what would the controlled vocabulary system for poetry be, and how would it overlap with other genres like painting or photography?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One part of his response to this question was another film that presented the bibliographic materials of a dissertation as poetry with an accompanying soundtrack. “Movies have soundtracks,” Lin said. “Why can’t bibliographies have soundtracks?” The resulting film was a fifteen-minute-long bibliography, presented in colorful and varying fonts that slowly appeared on the screen through a variety of slideshow-style transitions. It was accompanied by a rhythm-heavy medley soundtrack reminiscent at some moments of experimental rock, at other times of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>indie pop. The poem itself varied in character, with some slides consisting entirely of a long HTML link and others including more legible text, such as “Norwegian architectural review volume 36…”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the presentation finished and Lin took questions, he played a video in the background which also presented a poem as a slideshow. He explained that the video was 24 hours long, adding that “this should really be a six-month piece.” After being asked how he generated content for a piece of that length, he explained his process of sampling other texts. Some of the text was bibliographic and “paratextual.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m really interested in the exterior elements of textual production and authorship,” he said. Some of the sampling was more spontaneous. “I put a vacuum cleaner manual in,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Miller White ’20 attended Lin’s presentation after reading “Seven Controlled Vocabularies” for a class. “I thought it was a fantastic display of what I would consider the most contemporary version of poetry … that approaches interdisciplinary subject and form,” White said. Lin’s poetry studies “the identification and the examination of the poetics of another discipline,” he added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>‘Until, Until, Until...’ re-enacts 1981 performance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Until, Until, Until…” a performance directed, written and produced by Los Angeles-based artist Edgar Arceneaux was staged in Studio 1 at the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights last week. Presented by the Brown Arts Initiative, the multimedia play reimagines and re-enacts Broadway actor Ben Vereen’s 1981 performance at former president Ronald Reagan’s inaugural ball.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The event’s program explained that in the original performance, Vereen gave an homage to vaudevillian Bert Williams, one of America’s first mainstream black entertainers, by performing the 1912 hit song, “Waiting for Robert E. Lee,” in blackface as Williams had been required to do during his vaudeville productions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Vereen followed his first song with a performance of Williams’ song “Nobody,” which commented on the harmful history of racial stereotypes within performance as he emotionally wiped the makeup off of his face.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But in its televised program of the event, ABC chose not to air the last five minutes of Vereen’s performance — losing the political statement he had intended to make. Controversy ensued, as viewers had only seen Vereen, a black man, dance and sing in blackface in front of Reagan. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Traveling through time and space, Arceneaux’s piece invited audience members to consider not only this original commentary but also the effects of ABC’s omission on Vereen’s reputation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The play began with a quote from Vereen, printed in large typeface on a semi-transparent curtain pulled across the stage. In part, it read: “I thought that it went well. Everyone was congratulating me when I left the stage. Two days later my conductor said to me, ‘brace yourself.’” The curtain opens to reveal actor Frank Lawson, playing Vereen, rehearsing his entrance to Reagan’s inaugural ball.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The hour-long performance continued with a series of other scenes, including one featuring actress Jes Dugger, who played Marie Osmond, the singer at the inaugural ball who followed Vereen’s act. Near the show’s conclusion, stage assistants stepped into the audience, beckoning them to enter the curtained, square stage area. Most of the audience followed the assistants into empty chairs along either side of the stage. Lawson applied the black-and-white makeup to himself and resumed the performance. After an imaginary bartender rejected his request to serve the audience drinks, Lawson’s subsequent dialogue conveyed his frustration at being denied service due to the color of his skin.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lawson’s character then proceeded to sing Williams’ seminal song “Nobody.” During this performance, Lawson removed the black makeup from his face, signaling the portion of Vereen’s original performance that ABC denied viewers across the nation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the end of the song, Lawson thanked the audience and stood pensively for a few long moments before exiting the curtained stage area, leaving the audience waiting for a cue to signal the end of the performance. After some time, a camera operator panned across the faces of the audience, replacing the projected images of the 1981 inaugural ball attendees on the stage curtains during the final song. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friday, the audience sat for nine silent minutes before one member finally left. His exit cued a shift in the music and lights, indicating that the performance had concluded. Thursday, it took only about two-and-a-half minutes for the first audience member to leave, Arceneaux said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Until, Until, Until…” featured varied multimedia technology including projected images and videos as well as music and special audio effects. These techniques “created this world in which we as audience members could sort of transgress multiple boundaries. … At one point, we were an external Brown audience watching the play, and then at another point, we were in a sense transported and had become the audience at Ronald Reagan’s inauguration,” said Butch Rovan, faculty director of the Brown Arts Initiative. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Arceneaux utilized the multimedia technology to invoke ideas of memory, trauma and reflection. “I decided to tell the story not from a historical perspective, but from the way that Ben Vereen remembers it — which is as a series of traumas,” he said. “So in that regard, I’m being faithful to the feelings of the memory, without trying to do what I think is essentially impossible — which is to tell it exactly as it happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Arceneaux first saw Vereen’s 1981 performance on a VHS tape as part of a documentary on black artists in 2007. The documentary included Vereen’s entire performance, leaving Arceneaux unaware of the negative professional and psychological ramifications that the televised version had on Vereen’s life and work. That is, until he encountered Vereen himself at a birthday party.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“He was very welcoming,” Arceneaux said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But when I mentioned his performance in 1981, he shuddered. I could tell that I’d struck a nerve. But I didn’t know why.” Based off the artist’s actual interactions with the performer, “Until, Until, Until…” includes a scene where Arceneaux, playing himself, sits with the actor playing Vereen in his living room, watching the original footage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ultimately, Arceneaux said he hoped his work could teach his audience “something about the world.” He watched the individuals in the audience struggling with the decision to leave, realizing that “at some point you then start asking yourself, well is this story over yet?” With that questioning comes a transformation: Audience members look around at the individuals that surrounded them and realize that their next move had become a group decision.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s like this idea of going from ‘I’ to ‘we.’ People start to figure out how to negotiate that space. … It’s kind of like a little tiny microcosm of society that happens inside (the curtains),” Arceneaux said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The amazing thing about the piece is that it doesn’t offer closure. You leave, and it doesn’t end. As an audience member you’re left to just try to create your own closure — and maybe it doesn’t ever end for you,” Rovan said. “The issues that it raises are still things that we are grappling with today.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rovan stressed the ability of this experimental work to remain accessible to a wide audience. “This piece worked on so many different levels — it was visceral, it was cerebral, it was contemplative, it was very emotional,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Arceneaux hopes to continue performing the piece around the country. While it has toured nationally since its creation in 2015, Arceneaux said the 2016 election “changed my resolve to tour it and show it more, considering this very surreal political reality that we’re in where entertainment and politics have become so intertwined.” He added, “a story like this allows us to see the truth in a way that I think telling the story straight couldn’t do.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He hopes that they can bring the performance to as many politically divided and red states as possible, where the piece might cause controversy but also might inspire people to reconsider their views. This latter possibility gives him hope that the performance “might shift their sense of justice,” he said.</span></p>

		<title>Granoff Center hosts first U.S. screening of Bergman documentary</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Students gathered in the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts’ Martinos Auditorium Tuesday for the first U.S. showing of “Bergman — A Year in a Life.” Directed by Jane Magnusson ’92, this documentary focuses on world-famous Swedish film and theater director Ingmar Bergman in 1957, the year he rose to international stardom. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Marc Redfield, professor of comparative literature and chair of the department, the event was held to showcase a “remarkable film” created by Brown alums while also paying homage to Professor of Comparative Literature Arnold Weinstein, who has been teaching at the University since 1968. The film was directed by Magnusson, with the help of Henrik von Sydow ’82 — both of whom were students of Weinstein as undergraduates. Magnusson hails from Sweden, but it wasn’t until taking Weinstein’s “Nordic Legacy” class on Scandinavian literature that she learned about Bergman’s influence. According to Redfield, Weinstein was present at the documentary’s premiere in Stockholm, along with the Prime Minister of Sweden and other Swedish dignitaries. When Weinstein asked Magnusson and von Sydow to come to Brown for a screening, they “knew they couldn’t miss it,” Magnusson said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This year marks the centennial of Bergman’s birth in 1918, so cinemas around the world have stayed busy screening retrospectives and reflecting on his equally cryptic life and work. In 1957 alone, Bergman released the films “The Seventh Seal” and “Wild Strawberries,” as well as directing a made-for-TV movie and several plays. Rumors of Bergman’s neurotic, dictatorial directing style contributed to his cult of personality. Many of his films are assumed to be autobiographical, but “A Year in a Life” features a never-before-seen interview with his brother Dag Bergman suggesting the way Bergman’s films depicted their shared childhood often strayed from the truth. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Magnusson’s documentary uses footage from Bergman’s films, as well as interviews from a number of Bergman scholars and his colleagues, to paint a nuanced, empathetic portrait of the director that Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman called “<a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/bergman-a-year-in-a-life-review-ingmar-bergman-1202808268/">one of the most honest and overflowing portraits of a film artist that I can remember seeing.</a>” Among the many interviewed were American singer, actress and filmmaker Barbra Streisand, 1960s talk-show host Dick Cavett and Weinstein himself.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Weinstein said when introducing the film that Magnusson’s choice to focus on 1957 was “brilliant.” He added, “unlike the kind of Scandinavian gloom that most of you probably anticipate if you’ve seen Bergman, you will laugh at many moments in this film. That is much due to the wit of Magnusson.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Asked why she took on the project, Magnusson said, “When I graduated in 1992 and went back to Sweden, Bergman was just this really grumpy old man who could make anything he wanted with Sweden’s cultural funding. I wanted to figure out who this grumpy old man once was in order to get at the root of the power he had in Sweden.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Magnusson is also the visionary behind films like “Cupcake” and “Christina Lindberg: The Original Eyepatch Wearing Butt Kicking Movie Babe.” She is currently working on a new documentary about Madeline Stuart, “the only professional model with Down Syndrome,” Magnusson said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Magnusson’s success is a testament to how “a Brown education can change your life in wonderful ways,” Redfield said. “Learning about literature or film can have unanticipated, wonderful consequences later in life.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Free Solo,” a National Geographic documentary, is a film that examines the fear and motivation behind incredible human achievement, against a backdrop of stunning natural landscapes. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The nerve-wracking film chronicles the journey of Alex Honnold, a famous U.S. rock climber, as he prepares to “free solo” El Capitan, a mountain face in Yosemite National Park. Free soloing is rock climbing without any ropes or equipment at heights where falling almost inevitably results in death. Prior to Honnold’s attempt, no one had ever free soloed El Capitan, which towers around 3,000 feet at its highest peak. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The film is breathtaking, not only because of the natural beauty depicted, but because of the emotion and tension in such a treacherous feat. As the movie develops, Honnold’s personality becomes a central component of the film, as everyone around him seeks to understand his motivation for undertaking an endeavor that could easily lead to his death. Honnold seems fearless and obsessed with achievement, unsatisfied until he at least tries to free solo El Capitan. Everyone advises him against it, including his girlfriend, Sanni. Other free soloists caution that it is too dangerous, and fear for his life. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Delving into Honnold’s childhood, examining his relationships and even studying his brain, the film is mostly a portrait of an eccentric climber. At one point, when asked about his motivations, Honnold speaks about a warrior spirit that continually inspires him.“This is your path, and you will pursue it with excellence,” he said. <span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The majority of the movie focuses on Honnold’s preparation for the climb. Honnold details exactly how he plans to get through the most difficult parts, down to the tiny shifts in the cliff that he would cling to. In the thrilling scenes of Honnold’s climb, the abstract details of the danger and hardship illustrated throughout his preparation suddenly become edge-of-your-seat anticipation and apprehension.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi directed the movie and recruited a team of seasoned climbers to help them film. In the movie, the crew openly discusses with Honnold the details of shooting the film and recounts how they struggled with the ethics of filming their friend. Chin explains that he doesn’t want the camera’s presence to put pressure on Honnold, which could be potentially disastrous. One of the crew members, Mikey Schaefer, discusses his fear that as he was filming, he would capture Honnold “falling through the frame to his death.” In fact, during Honnold’s free solo climb, Schaefer looked away from the camera as he was filming the riskiest parts.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Free Solo” creates a disjointed picture. On the one hand, Honnold’s attempt is moving and awe-inspiring, but the film leaves the viewer wondering: Is it worth the risk?</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Exhibition explores how Asian identity intersects with life experiences</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">“He remembers those vanished years. As though looking through a dusty windowpane, the past is something he could see, but not touch. And everything he sees is blurred and indistinct.” This quote from the 2000 film “In the Mood for Love” by director Wong Kar-wai serves as a common thread in the latest exhibition of the same name, which opened at the Rhode Island School of Design Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery Nov. 29. As if sweeping the dust off the windowpanes, curators of the exhibition, RISD seniors Christine Cho, Emi Chun and Zak Nguyen, presented a show that featured works by Asian/American and Pacific Islander/American identifying artists, which shed light on the collective memories of their multiple identities.</p>
<p class="p4">Growing up with varying backgrounds, the curators recognized the diversity within Asian populations. They further acknowledged the “carelessness” of the term “pan-Asia,” Cho said. Nguyen said that the show is not solely about Asian identity, but also “how that interacts with other identities.”</p>
<p class="p4">When selecting art for the show, the curators sought to include a wide spectrum of artists. “Someone who is queer and Asian has an equally important voice as somebody who is disabled and Asian or someone who was adopted,” Nguyen said.</p>
<p class="p4">As co-presidents of the RISD Asian Intersection + Diaspora, the three curators purposed the exhibition as a representation of their existences that have otherwise been “flattened” by the surrounding spaces, Chun said. In an effort to highlight the varying ways Asian identity is experienced, Chun said that their intent was to provide “a space within those intersections to exist,” and to “find that moment of safety in between all those intersections where we can have different conversations that are relevant to our existence here in RISD and the diaspora of living in this country.”</p>
<p class="p4">Although unique in their experiences and backgrounds, each artist generated work that converses with other exhibited work, Nguyen said. “One of the most important lines in our statement was the fact that even though the artists may not even know it, we’ve always been in conversation with each other in one way or another,” Chun said.</p>
<p class="p4">Among the featured pieces is an animation created by RISD senior Xiner Jiang, which depicts a woman whose features seem distorted and restructured with each change in frame. Right across from the video is a series of three photographs taken by Jono Cheong, also a RISD senior, featuring a cowboy with a powdered white face and red blush. Both works similarly challenge Western beauty standards.</p>
<p class="p4">When visiting the exhibition, there are “themes you begin to see … you can begin to notice overlaps,” Cho said.</p>
<p class="p4">Artists grappled with themes including conflicting standards of beauty and cis-heteronormativity, traversing of multiple realities, burdens of family expectations and renewed memory of intergenerational traumas. The conversations exchanged in the artworks “reaffirm that our experiences were real, not skewed by our insecurities,” Cho said. “We’re in a space where the artists are thinking similar ideas. It becomes a moment of collective memory.”</p>
<p class="p4">While providing a space that allows the artists’ voices to be expressed authentically, the curators acknowledged that the efforts of vocalizing Asian/American and Pacific Islander/American identities do not stop in the gallery. When talking about the inspiration behind choosing the title “In the Mood for Love,” Cho said that when she wascurating, she discovered “so many more rich connections and omens” between Wong Kar-wai’s film and the Asian/American community at RISD. “It is not enough just to have this show and benefit from it and move on. We have to really continue to challenge our community, not only thinking about what solidarity looks like within the Asian/AAPI community, but also with other (people of color),” she added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy releases first solo album, “WARM”</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Jeff Tweedy, singer and guitarist of Chicago alternative rock band Wilco, released his first solo album of original songs, “WARM,” on Nov. 30, offering a tender, personal perspective into his insecurities and the struggles that shape his work and the Wilco canon.</p>
<p class="p2">Deserts, birds, Neil Young-esque ramblin’ man — all define Jeff Tweedy. It’s easy to think of descriptors, associations and comparisons for the sound of “WARM.” But “WARM” is entirely personal and draws from 51-year-old Tweedy’s experiences with addiction, family and death. With his sons Spencer and Sammy Tweedy contributing vocals, drums and synthesizers, “WARM” gently pushes familiar Wilco listeners to reflect on the idea of vulnerability and its power to make the personal universal.</p>
<p class="p2">“WARM” is an album that lodges itself in music that tries to break your heart. Tweedy presents stripped-down, whispery songs that remind his fans of the beloved reflective, self-conscious quality of the singer-songwriter and Wilco itself. In songs like “Don’t Forget,” Tweedy seems to be addressing listeners — as well as his sons — in a very fatherly way. He sighs of regret, driving and even death : “Don’t forget sometimes / We all, we all think about dying / Don’t let it kill you.”</p>
<p class="p2">With casual wisdom and sparse, creaking, guitar-based instrumentals, Tweedy sings in a manner that seems to draw upon his own experience with fatherhood. He lightly reminds, with an almost insecure tone, “Don’t forget to brush your teeth / Or you’ll have a funny smile / you don’t have to smile at me.” Tweedy somehow speaks for himself and dads around the world.</p>
<p class="p2">It is important to consider Jeff Tweedy’s work with respect to Wilco. Their widely acclaimed 2002 album “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot” served as one of the pillars of 2000s indie sound with its sprawling, psychedelia-inspired lyrics and rich, folky musical depth. Songs like “I Am Trying to Break Your Heart” perfectly encapsulate what Tweedy is known and loved for — poetic, sonically charged sprawls of sound that are slightly existential, nervous and vulnerable in tone. Look through the comments on any Wilco YouTube lyric video and witness emotional praise; 16-year-olds and 48-year-olds alike herald Tweedy’s ability to empathize and humanize.</p>
<p class="p2">Tweedy’s “WARM” doesn’t depart from this trait; it only expands and opens further with its autobiographical nature. On the track “Having Been Is No Way to Be,” Tweedy composes a phantasmagoric sound that reflects on his addiction to prescription painkillers — an addiction that primarily persisted through the recording of “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.” He sings, impersonating some Wilco fans, “What drugs did you take / And why don’t you start taking them again?”</p>
<p class="p2">Tweedy is certainly alluding to some of his followers that yearn for a “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot” sound, or at least a reinvention of it. With minimal instrumentals, the Wilco frontman talks of pain and change, or the lack thereof. In “How Hard It Is for a Desert to Die,” Tweedy quietly rasps and meditates on how the deeper, richer qualities of pain, specifically grief, can shape us. It’s not that these concepts or subjects he sings of are novel or unique — in fact, it’s the opposite. Throughout the album, he drones and hums about ideas that give anxiety to us all: death, isolation, time. “I know what it’s like / To not feel love,” Tweedy repetitively tells us in “I Know What It’s Like,” a windy Wilco demo-like track that espouses a solidarity between singer and listener.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The insecurities and vulnerabilities that shape Tweedy reflect the same ones that shape us, and this is what makes “WARM” so deeply moving in an understated way. He demonstrates an ability to carefully tread an artistic obfuscation between personal and universal emotions like grief, pain and love. Through the entire album, Tweedy elaborates on his sensitive sonic identity to show it is very much connected to Wilco’s sound and history, at least to listeners’ ears. But he also proves that his artistic identity still stands on its own. Tweedy urges fans to listen closely to his introspection, establishing his musical, lyrical and empathetic prowess.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bill Jacobson ’77, alongside eleven other photographers, is complicating the notion of “abstraction” on College Hill. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The artists’ work is featured in the List Art Center lobby as part of “Recent Acquisitions: Photography and Abstraction” — a photo exhibit that runs from Jan. 19 to May 26. The second of List’s recent exhibits showcasing new additions to its photography collection, “Recent Acquisitions” was curated by Jo-Ann Conklin, director of the Bell Gallery. The exhibit is meant to give a platform to artists like Jacobson, who meditate on the abstract and its power to manipulate subject and interpretation. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Recent Acquisitions” features photographs that express subjects and themes in a myriad of abstractions, whether it be through the use of color, space, frame or material. Some pieces seem to intentionally question the audience’s definitions and expectations of abstraction as a label for art.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There is always that question about photography of whether you can do something that is truly abstract,” given that the form captures the life references in front of the lens, Conklin said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jacobson’s series involves photographs of the real world and explores the common theme of rectangles in our physical space. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I wanted to synthesize that down and find the essence of that rectangle and then create my own image that used it as a primary subject,” Jacobson said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In “Place (Series) #512,” what seems like a simple red square against a white background,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is actually a photograph of a red card lying against a wall.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “The picture refers to abstraction because it eliminates a lot of information, and photography sits between the middle,” Jacobson added. “It raises the question of what is abstract.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The argument on abstraction really exists on levels of information of what we know in our conscious brain,” he said. “Once things start to elude (to) what we consciously know, it is very easy to lump it into this realm of abstraction instead of defining and saying what it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some works in the gallery were not only images; they explored interrelated materials, which alter the audience’s perception. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Iman Husain ‘22, who visited the exhibit, was particularly interested in Christiane Feser’s “Modell Konstrukt 97, 2015.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The two-dimensional image and the sculpted three-dimensional qualities really challenge the expectations of a certain material,” Husain said</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Miranda Luiz ‘22, another visitor, was intrigued by Marilyn Bridges’ “Geometrics, Lone Wolf, Oklahoma, 1987” because of its study on the reflexive relationship between humans and the environment. “It’s not obvious that the photo is of farmland. The scene seems alien and distant, especially because it is cropped,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bill Jacobson will be returning to the University on March 12 for a lecture. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Collaborative exhibit reflects on biodiversity in Providence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Artistic and scientific history collide in “Entwined: Botany, Art and the Lost Cat Swamp Habitat,” an exhibit at the John Hay Library that examines biological diversity in Providence. The exhibit depicts the biodiversity of the Wayland and Blackstone neighborhoods in East Providence, previously known as “Cat Swamp,” by featuring botanical illustrations of wildflowers from the Rhode Island Historical Society and specimens collected by the Brown Herbarium. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Until the early 20th century, the Cat Swamp remained undeveloped, even during the urban expansion of College Hill and downtown Providence, said Tim Whitfeld, director of the Brown University Herbarium and assistant professor in the ecology and evolutionary biology department. Whitfeld, who helped curate the exhibit, explained that potential developers considered Cat Swamp too expensive and difficult to build on. The exhibit notes that a civil engineer named John Freeman began to develop Cat Swamp around 1915. Today, the former marshland includes areas like the commercial Wayland Square.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whitfeld hopes that the exhibit will give viewers a chance to learn more about the history of Providence, as well as provide an opportunity to discuss the loss of biodiversity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Perhaps now cities are becoming more aware of the importance of maintaining some biodiversity within the urban area … but certainly when the Cat Swamp area was being developed I doubt there was much effort to think about preserving this area just for its intrinsic importance to biological diversity,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The specimens displayed in the exhibit are only a fraction of the plants collected and preserved by the Brown Herbarium from Cat Swamp. According to Whitfeld, the Herbarium boasts over 500 botanical specimens from the Cat Swamp area, mostly collected in the late 1800s. William Whitman Bailey, the first professor of botany at Brown, was instrumental in collecting many of the these specimens. Richard Ring, the deputy executive director for collections and interpretation at the Historical Society, explained that they possessed over 200 botanical illustrations by the 19th-century artist Edward Lewis Peckham. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the curators cross examined Peckham’s illustrations with the Herbarium collection, they realized the overlap of species from the Cat Swamp area. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Karen Asher, former president of the Rhode Island Wild Plant Society, described how she was immediately in awe of the beauty of Peckham’s drawings. “Nobody had even heard of this guy — Edward Peckham — and the quality of his work is like the quality of Audubon,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The exhibit presents Peckham’s illustrations with specimens of the same species, along with descriptions, poems, maps, quotes and even journals of Bailey and Peckham. Many of these species of wildflowers can no longer be found in Providence, although it is possible to see them in other parts of Rhode Island. “It’s a lesson in what happens to biological diversity as urban development gradually takes over an area,” Whitfeld said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The showcase is also in collaboration with the project Year of the City, “a yearlong initiative throughout the city of Providence to exhibit in all of the neighborhoods of Providence something about the history of Providence,” said Tiffini Bowers, exhibition curator at the John Hay Library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bowers described how the intersection of science, art and history in “Entwined” makes it a natural fit. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Entwined” will be displayed at the John Hay exhibition gallery through April 30. The exhibit is the result of a collaboration between the Rhode Island Historical Society, the Rhode Island Wild Plant Society, the Brown Herbarium and the John Hay Library.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p2">In addition to attending discussions facilitated by Professors Wendy Edwards, chair of visual art and Butch Rovan, faculty director of the Brown Arts Initiative, students visited the studios and creative spaces of practicing artists. The seminar-style course represents the first time the BAI has hosted a course in the three years Wintersession has been offered.</p>
<p class="p2">Rovan said that the original idea for the class developed from conversations with alums living in Los Angeles. “Alumni really wanted to be in contact with Brown students. They wanted to help out,” Rovan said, adding that while bringing the alums to Providence was not a possibility, the advent of Wintersession in the last few years provided the opportunity to bring students to Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="p2">The class, housed in the studio of film and television director Davis Guggenheim ’86, gave way to expansive discussion that continued outside of the studio and around the city. Over the course of the program, about 20 alum artists invited students into their work spaces — including various personal studios, the Hockney Foundation, the LA Louver Gallery and Sony Pictures. The artists shared details about their artistic processes, along with pragmatic advice about embarking on a career in the arts.</p>
<p class="p2">Students in the course, who are practicing visual, musical and literary artists, worked toward a final forty-five minute presentation on a potential project of their own, after which a panel of alum gave feedback.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Edwards hopes the course allows for continuous dialogue between student and alum artists.“The alums are so generous when it comes to meeting Brown students,” she said, noting that their generosity was not limited to the students alone. “Everyone we talked to was engaged in social justice concerns and the community at larg</span>e.”</p>
<p class="p2">The artists and industry professionals who spoke with the class included film and television producer Nina Jacobson ’87, painter Loren Holland ’02 and composer Gabe Sokoloff ’06. Eve O’Shea ’20, a visual artist in the class whose practice focuses on painting and printmaking, said that seeing the studios of other artists was one of her favorite parts of the course. Although the fields represented by these professionals varied, O’Shea still found common ground, noting that “there was a lot of discussion (about) the art world in general.” Even when the discussion turned to a specific kind of art, O’Shea said that “to talk to those people and see what they’re doing firsthand is super interesting.”</p>
<p class="p2">O’Shea added that alums could offer very specific advice in this conversation because of their similar backgrounds. “It was like meeting people you already know in some strange way, because they went to Brown,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">Some alums were able to trace their intellectual paths back to the work they did during their time at the University. “A lot of alums talked about . . . the impact of the work that they started doing at Brown,” Edwards said, which often represented an artistic beginning “that remained a core part of the current work.”</p>
<p class="p2">Rovan emphasized the immersive nature of the constant discussion among both students and alums. Whether around a table, in a car or in a gallery, “the conversation kept going . . . about what it meant to be a creative artist today,” he said. “It was basically like a two-and-a-half-week seminar that never stopped.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the ground floor of the Perry and Marty Granoff Center for the Creative Arts, the sixth annual staff exhibition features an array of mediums including paintings, photographs, woodwork, quilts and sculptures. The exhibition, hosted by the Brown Arts Initiative, showcases the artistic talents of University staff members.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The exhibition title, “After Hours,” references the creative lives that many University staff members lead after the workday is over. “It speaks in part to this idea of the hidden work that goes on, that may not even be known by peoples’ colleagues,” said Emma Boast GS, the curator of the exhibition. Boast added that, while the exhibition does not have a single message, one takeaway “is to just appreciate the work and labor that folks do both within their day-to-day jobs and . . . outside of that.” Boast cited the complexity of staff members’ identities beyond their work at the University, which comes across in the exhibition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The kind of student that is attracted to Brown is a multi-dimensional person that has creative interests, and I would say that that’s true of the staff as well,” said Anne Bergeron, managing director of the Brown Arts Initiative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chira DelSesto, associate director of the Brown Arts Initiative, said that the exhibition allows staff members who do not usually share their work in a professional setting to do so. “The artists are able to bring their colleagues and coworkers to come and see their work,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In some of the exhibited work, the connection between the staff member’s artistic practice and professional occupation is evident. Daniel Sperry works as a carpenter for the University’s Facilities Management. “For quite a few years I got to work with a lot of the antique furniture here at Brown,” Sperry said. His skill in woodworking is clear in the ornate pieces he contributed to the exhibition. One such piece is “Parrot Knife,” a knife with a handle in the shape of a parrot’s head made from a variety of materials. “The handle right there is an old axe handle . . . then maple burl down there, then bone, then the black is a violin peg,” he said, gesturing toward the piece as he explained the construction of the knife. While Sperry buys some of his materials, he repurposes others — for example, the violin peg in “Parrot Knife” came from his work repairing violins. Other pieces make use of marble, bronze and even the dried husk of an avocado.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In other displayed pieces, the staff member’s occupation is not directly reflected in their artwork. Desirae Mix, assistant director of Student and Employee Accessibility Services, saw an advertisement for the exhibition and was inspired to revive and submit a project she began several years ago. Three pieces from the series “Cult Movie Icons” appear in the gallery, each showing the stylized face of a character from films like Kill Bill: Volume One and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. “I think movies are an easy talking point to get some students out of their shell,” Mix said, explaining that she likes to use her art to help find common ground with other people, especially at work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although she has used mediums like acrylic and canvas in other series, Mix’s distinctive style comes in part from her materials. “If I want to do something, I want to make sure I can do it with items that are readily available in my desk,” Mix said. She created the “Cult Movie Icons” series using only permanent marker and mechanical pencil. “I’m a big fan of street art, particularly stencil style,” Mix said, citing her admiration for the street art of Florentine artist Tiana Kai. She also mentioned influences closer to home, adding that seeing the murals in Providence every day inspired her to return to her own work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Other work in the gallery includes sculpture, photography, painting and multimedia art forms. While the exhibition has featured live music in past years, it typically attracts visual art, DelSesto said. And while the gallery setting does set limits on the kinds of art that can be featured, the exhibition seeks to encompass as much as possible. “I think generally we would be open to any creative practice that a staff member has. We would certainly at least want to have a conversation to see what’s possible,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The “After Hours” staff exhibition will be on display in Granoff through Feb. 21, closing with a public reception that evening.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Rhode Island Virtual Reality hosted its monthly meet-up last Thursday at AS220 for virtual reality enthusiasts to hear from speakers in the business. During the two-hour meet-up, visitors shared ideas, formed connections and learned more about the recent innovations in the virtual reality and augmented reality industry.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The purpose of the meet-up was to update participants on the most recent technology developments as featured in the annual Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas this past January. The meet-up invited the co-founder of Xmark Lab Nicholas Napp as the keynote speaker to expand upon some of the products showcased at CES and provide his insight on various trends in VR/AR development. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Participants at the RIVR meet-up included various businesses, tech startups and students. “There are a lot of companies that are interested in (the CES) but are unable to go,” said Siu-Li Khoe, the executive director of RIVR and organizer of the event. For a lot of small businesses willing to engage in the industry without the time or the financial resources to attend the conference, the meet-up was an opportunity to stay up-to-date and connect with others with the same interests.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">RIVR aims “to energize the VR and AR ecosystem,” Khoe said. “Because this is such a leading-edge industry, we are really talking about bridging the gap between people who have inspirations and ideas, and actually having funded, resourced projects.” Since the establishment of RIVR, Khoe noted that she “can point to an increasing number of projects that are being funded.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The companies associated with RIVR come from a wide range of fields, including non-profit work, film production and computer science. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are looking at how VR can be incorporated to make workplace learning more effective and make it so that people actually enjoy it,” said Anne Devaney, program manager of TCP Learning and one of the participants at the meet-up.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">John Smithers, vice-president in business development and strategic partnerships of the Mullings Group, said that he is especially intrigued by how AR and VR can play a role in education, parenting, trauma relief and other humanitarian applications.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Khoe describes the VR culture in Rhode Island to be “warm, welcoming and enthusiastic.” She further said that one of RIVR’s tasks is to “partner ruthlessly.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">RIVR has collaborated with Brown students and groups, including the Ivy Film Festival and Bears@Work, a computer science student organization. RIVR has further conducted tours at the YURT Ultimate Reality Theatre, the University’s virtual reality theater, and has held meet-ups at the Granoff Center. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Students from the Brown Department of Visual Art showcased their artwork in exhibitions at the List Art Center.</p>
<p class="p2">The exhibitions, which opened Dec. 21 and close Jan. 31, gave Isabela Lovelace ’20, Caitlin Takeda ’20 and Miranda Villanueva ’20 an opportunity to present art that reflected on everything from food to deeply personal experiences.</p>
<p class="p2">Lovelace’s first solo exhibition, titled “the ambient medium del medio ambient,” explored the “concept of home and the stability of home,” she said. With one parent from the Caribbean and the other from Southern California, the two recent natural disasters of Hurricane Maria and the debris flow through Santa Barbara have drastically impacted Lovelace’s connection with places integral to her identity, she wrote in her artist’s statement.</p>
<p class="p2">“I decided to explore those concepts through art and integrate my other concentration, which is geology, within this exhibition to explore not only the parameters of disasters, but the impact disasters have on the land as well,” Lovelace said.</p>
<p class="p2">Similar to Lovelace’s, Takeda’s solo exhibition was closely related to her heritage. After learning more about Japanese-American incarceration during World War II, Takeda was moved by a trip to Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming, where her grandfather had been confined. Through the exhibition, Takeda intended “to reframe” the incarceration sites; instead of portraying them from the perspective of government photography, she wanted to illustrate the “very deep emotional and familial ties” within the site.</p>
<p class="p2">While Lovelace and Takeda each curated solo exhibitions, Villanueva curated a group exhibition, which was titled “Whetted Appetites” and used food as a common motif among the pieces. Five artists, including Villanueva, had artwork on display, using a variety of mediums. Villanueva’s own piece “Red Wine and Cherries (Self Portrait no. II),” a collage that used food to resemble a menstruating woman’s body, shared thematic similarities with a collection of short videos filmed by Nicole Cochary ’19. Both of these pieces touched on “absurdity in advertisement,” Villanueva said. Another artist, Herald illustrator Pia Mileaf-Patel ’20, showcased a series of 32 photos titled “Italian hours.” Her piece, and the showcased images by Alex Westfall ’20, both reflected on “food in conjunction to memory,” Villanueva said. Alyssa Rodriguez ’19.5 contributed a video to the exhibition, in which she filmed herself eating an onion to “think about the disgust and possession and ownership of a body,” Villanueva added.</p>
<p class="p2">“There are a lot of people who want gallery spaces, but it’s not too difficult to get one if you want it,” Villanueva said. The VISA department selected students through the process of a lottery. Once selected, the department has resources to guide students along the process of curating, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">“A lot of good ideas come out of being inspired by other people’s work,” Lovelace said, who has also been part of a group exhibition before. But her first solo exhibition allowed her to “manage a lot more details” that went into the show. “There was a lot more just my own thoughts and my pieces, and I could determine a lot more,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">For these VISA concentrators, the exhibitions provided the opportunity to gain more experience in creating personalized shows.</p>
<p class="p2">“You get the chance to curate, which is not something you get to do all the time. … This is kind of a good opportunity to experience something outside the norm,” Villanueva said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Students from the Brown Department of Visual Art showcased their artwork in exhibitions at the List Art Center.</p>
<p class="p2">The exhibitions, which opened Dec. 21 and close Jan. 31, gave Isabela Lovelace ’20, Caitlin Takeda ’20 and Miranda Villanueva ’20 an opportunity to present art that reflected on everything from food to deeply personal experiences.</p>
<p class="p2">Lovelace’s first solo exhibition, titled “the ambient medium del medio ambient,” explored the “concept of home and the stability of home,” she said. With one parent from the Caribbean and the other from Southern California, the two recent natural disasters of Hurricane Maria and the debris flow through Santa Barbara have drastically impacted Lovelace’s connection with places integral to her identity, she wrote in her artist’s statement.</p>
<p class="p2">“I decided to explore those concepts through art and integrate my other concentration, which is geology, within this exhibition to explore not only the parameters of disasters, but the impact disasters have on the land as well,” Lovelace said.</p>
<p class="p2">Similar to Lovelace’s, Takeda’s solo exhibition was closely related to her heritage. After learning more about Japanese-American incarceration during World War II, Takeda was moved by a trip to Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming, where her grandfather had been confined. Through the exhibition, Takeda intended “to reframe” the incarceration sites; instead of portraying them from the perspective of government photography, she wanted to illustrate the “very deep emotional and familial ties” within the site.</p>
<p class="p2">While Lovelace and Takeda each curated solo exhibitions, Villanueva curated a group exhibition, which was titled “Whetted Appetites” and used food as a common motif among the pieces. Five artists, including Villanueva, had artwork on display, using a variety of mediums. Villanueva’s own piece “Red Wine and Cherries (Self Portrait no.
