		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Three and<span class="s1"> a half years ago, Elisha Anderson ’98, former associate director of college admission, visited my high school. For many of you, there is probably nothing too remarkable about that sentence. But I went to a small public high school in southern West Virginia. A school with a college attendance rate of about 40 percent. A school that, for athletics, was placed in West Virginia’s “Coalfields Conference.” I had to drive an hour and a half to hear a group of admission officers from other elite schools speak. The only other college to ever send a representative to my high school was a public university three miles away. Yet I was able to speak one-on-one, for almost an hour, with a representative from Brown who had traveled 168 times further.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For this reason, during my first two years at Brown, I never paid much mind to the demands I heard for better recruitment, financial aid and support for students from low- and middle-income backgrounds. Sure, it would have been great to get better aid (I was lucky enough to be able to choose Brown, though its financial offer fell short of its peer schools), but Brown’s recruiting already seemed so many miles above that of its peers that it felt absurd to complain. After all, if Brown could come to my school, I figured they must have been nearly everywhere. It seemed clear that Brown was already going above and beyond.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet last week, the New York Times published an article indicating efforts on recruitment and financial aid remain to be made. In contrast to my experience, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html?_r=0">Brown still admits</a> more students with income in the top 1 percent than it does in the entire bottom 60 percent of Americans. Of course, this is true for five of the eight schools in the Ivy League. Harvard, known for its generous aid, fares better, but Columbia and Cornell also make the cut. Brown is not only a step behind its peers in recruiting and matriculating low- and middle- income students, but also has the highest median family income of all its peers.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Admittedly, these figures apply to the class of 2013 and may have since changed. My experience may have even been a conscious attempt to remedy this trend. Yet recruiting on its own is not enough. As I mentioned before, I was lucky enough to be able to accept Brown even though it declined to fully match the aid I might have received elsewhere. I may have had this choice, but many others do not. The scale of Brown’s financial aid lags behind that of other top-tier schools: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/05/17/heres-a-look-at-financial-aid-in-the-ivy-league-by-the-numbers/?utm_term=.efc7e17a9902">According to the Washington Post</a>, Brown offers the lowest percentage of need-based grants in the Ivy League.</p>
<p class="p2">Harvard has one of the lowest family median incomes among the Ivies, but it almost certainly receives a comparable number of applications from the one percent. It has managed to bring in a larger number of low- and middle- income students because it has committed to making attendance financially attractive. With its smaller endowment, Brown lacks comparable aid necessary for its undergraduate programs to compete with its peers. Brown can solve its financial diversity problem, but it must first be able to commit to investing in its undergraduate aid on the level of other Ivies.</p>
<p class="p2">The New York Times article speaks more to the difficulties that low- and middle- income students face in admission, with good reason. Many students aren’t even aware that these schools are viable options for them, much less the extent of financial aid that is available. From my personal experience, I can attest to the fact that Brown’s Admission Office works hard to solve this problem. It was ridiculous that a Brown representative showed up at my high school when no one else did, and I don’t just mean no one from within the Ivy League: I mean no one. I commend Brown for making this effort; the lengths it went to — at least in my experience — were extensive. Though expanding access in admission is a crucial step, Brown still has work to do to make attendance truly affordable for these low- and middle-income students. As an Ivy whose aid is comparatively quite poor, Brown’s problem remains financial.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What’s the point of college? On my final first day of class as an undergraduate, this question looms at the top of my mind. “Mobility Report Cards: The Role of Colleges in Intergenerational Mobility,” a <a href="http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/papers/coll_mrc_paper.pdf">paper</a> co-authored by Associate Professor of Economics John Friedman, provides one answer: socioeconomic mobility. According to the study, parental income is a hugely significant factor in students’ access to colleges. Yet students who attend the same college have similar earnings potential, regardless of their family background — a strong indicator that college has an equalizing effect. Of course, since correlation does not imply causation, the study can’t explain by what mechanism a college degree levels the playing field so dramatically. Still, it offers a fascinating picture of the complex relationship between income and higher education.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If one of the chief purposes of universities is to encourage upward mobility, then it is clear that an enormous amount of work remains for Brown in particular and the higher education system in general. Among the 12 “Ivy Plus” universities — the Ivy League, Duke University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the University of Chicago, as defined by a recent New York Times article about social mobility and colleges — Brown boasts the highest median parental income, the second-highest share of students from the top 1 percent and the third-highest share of students from the top 20 percent, according to that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/brown-university">article</a>. The University undoubtedly remains a cozy bastion of the upper and upper-middle class. More concerning than the socioeconomic situation of incoming students is that of alums: In terms of both median student income at age 34 and overall mobility, Brown is second-to-last among its Ivy Plus peers. Though the income measure is hardly surprising, Brown’s relatively poor performance on the overall mobility index is disheartening.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These statistics should give all members of the Brown community pause. Brown has a reputation as the most laid-back, socially aware member of the Ivy League. To what extent, though, does the University participate in the inequitable system that so many of its students hope to push against? A certain denial of Brown’s complicity in social inequality exists not only within the administration but also among students themselves. While potentially divisive issues of race, gender and sexuality are discussed with little hesitation, class is a different ball of wax. In my personal experience, friends from different socioeconomic classes rarely discuss the matter ­— perhaps it’s too awkward to discuss money, especially when it’s a question of your parents’ money or when it impacts your social life. Because many students come from such affluent backgrounds, most assume that there is little to say about the matter. But the statistics reveal that our community is one in which economically disadvantaged students are in the extreme minority. In striving to make Brown as inclusive as possible, class must be taken into account. That means aiming to make the income distribution of students less heavily skewed in favor of the top 1 percent — easier said than done given that society overall often undermines equitable access to higher education.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the study contains some good news for Brown and its prestigious counterparts. While Ivy Plus colleges might not reach the highest number of students, they are the most <a href="http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/papers/coll_mrc_paper.pdf">successful</a> at lifting students from the bottom fifth to the top 1 percent. According to <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/01/mobility">Friedman</a>, “Brown gets between 7 and 10 percent of its low-income students into the top 1 percent.” This is a remarkable achievement. In addition, the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/19/first-gen-low-income-student-center-unveiled/">opening</a> of the First-Generation and Low-Income Student Center in September 2016 speaks to the particular attention the University has recently directed toward socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Perhaps most importantly, Brown’s need-based financial aid policy means that for some low-income students, a Brown degree is less costly than that of a public university. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moreover, the burden of ensuring socioeconomic mobility does not rest solely on the shoulders of Brown and other universities. Every stage of the educational process — from pre-K through high school, extracurricular enrichment and standardized test prep — is instrumental in preparing students for undergraduate, and later professional, success. The relative lack of low- and middle-income students enrolled in elite colleges speaks in large part to the cumulative effect of all of these educational components, which high-income families are better equipped to provide for their children. Given the strong correlation between income and educational attainment, it seems likely that the close relationship between the economic elite and the intellectual elite will persist. If we hope to see increasing numbers of low- and middle-income students at Brown and in the rest of the Ivy League, society must prioritize public education at every turn. Private universities cannot do it alone. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perhaps it is less than productive to focus so much energy on the role of Brown and other elite institutions in securing the American Dream. After all, the Ivy Plus universities enroll roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/opinion/sunday/americas-great-working-class-colleges.html?_r=0">18,000</a> students per year — a fraction of the millions of undergraduate students in colleges across the country. While Brown and its peers should value contributing to low-income students’ future prospects, larger public institutions are the most effective engine for socioeconomic mobility on a large scale, as David Leonhardt’s New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/opinion/sunday/americas-great-working-class-colleges.html">column</a> “America’s Great Working-Class Colleges” shows. In addition to investing in primary and secondary education, we ought to do more to support public universities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As is often the case, one’s interpretation of Friedman’s study depends on what one is looking for. The New York Times framed it in a somewhat negative light by focusing on the disproportionate number of wealthy students at elite universities, while Brown’s interview with Friedman applied a positive spin by highlighting colleges’ importance for upward mobility. Ultimately, both angles reveal the urgent work that remains: making higher education and its remarkable socioeconomic benefits accessible for as many students as possible. In considering the many purposes of an undergraduate education, the Brown community — administration and students alike — shouldn’t lose sight of the part we play in an increasingly unequal American society.</span></p>

		<title>Colby &#039;20: Equal admission rates for all</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Regular decision applications to Brown are finally in, and for some applicants, their high school’s name has already dramatically increased their chances of admission. Select high schools have acceptance rates to elite universities like Brown that are double or triple the national average. Brown has institutionalized a preference for elite, and mostly private, high schools, which undermines its commitment to holistic diversity in the admissions process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown disproportionately focuses on applicants from elite private schools. It is an open secret that Brown assigns one admissions officer — Director of Admissions for Science Recruitment Annie Cappuccino — to just five of New York City’s most elite high schools, four of which are private. Yet these schools together constitute a meager graduating class of 1,120 students, according to their enrollment statistics. Meanwhile, Associate Director of Admission Momoho Takao works with all other public and private schools in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, an area that encompasses well over 35,000 graduating students yearly. These skewed admissions priorities are reflected in the composition of the student body: As a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html?_r=1">New York Times article notes, more Brown students come from the top 1 percent of incomes than from the entire bottom 60 percent. </a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The elite high schools represented in Cappuccino’s district boast remarkably high levels of Ivy League enrollment. For instance, an astonishing 40 percent of students who graduate from private schools like Collegiate School, <a href="http://www.brearley.org/page/academic--student-life/upper-school/college-advising">Brearley School</a> and <a href="http://www.trinityschoolnyc.org/page/our-program/college-counseling/trinity-school-matriculation,">Trinity School</a> attend Ivy League colleges. One might assume that not all students from these schools apply to Ivy League institutions and those who do are accepted at far higher rates than Brown’s stated <a href="https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/explore/admission-facts#countries">9 percent acceptance rate</a>. These high acceptance rates from New York elite high schools are not an exception, but rather the norm among elite private high schools around the country; graduates from private high schools like the <a href="https://www.dalton.org/program/high_school/college_counseling,">Dalton School</a>, <a href="http://www.horacemann.org/uploaded/PDFs/Forms/2014_College_attended_List.pdf">Horace Mann School</a> and <a href="http://www.chapin.edu/page.cfm?p=3725">Chapin School</a> all enroll in Ivy League schools at rates above 30 percent, according to their admissions statistics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One could argue that these are the most qualified applicants, but this disproportionate acceptance rate is very hard to justify considering the vastness and quality of <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/default.htm">New York City’s public school system</a>. The New York City Department of Education serves 1.1 million students in over 1,800 schools, including high-quality, specialized high schools and a citywide public school choice program. But only one, Stuyvesant High School, is on Cappuccino’s elite agenda. Still, no New York City public high school sees as many of their students attending Ivy League universities as the city’s elite private schools.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It also could be argued that most Ivy League applications come from elite high schools, and that’s why Brown accepts students from these schools at higher rates. But this is patently false. Brearley, for example, only has 57 students in its graduating class. This means that even if every single Brearley student applied to Brown,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the number of applicants would still be less than two years’ worth of applicants from one of the city’s upper middle-tier public school, Beacon High School.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">More than anything, this bias for private high schools undermines Brown’s stated goals of increasing diversity and inclusion. Brown has expanded the meaning of diversity to include gender diversity, aiming to maintain a near 50-50 gender balance. While Brown is making strides to increase its admission of underrepresented minorities, diversity in experience and upbringing is also important. Students from these private high schools are surrounded by peers and families that can afford an annual tuition in excess of $40,000 from a young age. And these high schools are largely racially homogeneous and often do not represent the communities in which they are located. Even specialized public schools, intended to serve the diverse student population of New York City, aren’t particularly diverse. Stuyvesant High School, for example, admitted just 10 black students last year out of an incoming<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>class of nearly 1,000, according to<a href="http://www.bkmag.com/2015/03/31/only-ten-black-students-were-offered-a-spot-at-stuyvesant-high-school-this-year-but-is-this-a-problem/"> Brooklyn Magazine</a>. When elite colleges admit students primarily from elite high schools, they ignore the economic and racial diversity of the broader student population.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Economic barriers exist to even gain entry to schools that provide these advantages in college admission. All of these selective private and public schools require standardized testing, which has a well-documented correlation with socioeconomic status. Standardized tests diminish the opportunities of lower-income students to gain admission to such exclusive educational institutions. The harm of these tests is compounded when success on such standardized exams is required as early as middle school to increase the chance of eventual admission to Ivy League schools.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown should shift its focus from elite private and public high schools and devote more attention to students from a wider range of educational backgrounds. Such an overwhelming focus on elite schools undermines<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brown’s stated commitment to diversity and also excludes a multitude of highly-qualified students who don’t come from elite schools. Horace Mann — who, ironically, happens to be the namesake of a New York City private school that charges thousands in tuition ­­— once called education “the great equalizer.” By focusing on elite private schools, Brown does a disservice to higher education’s role as a true equalizer and rather perpetuates existing inequalities in the United States. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we want admissions to be truly fair, students from elite schools should be subject to acceptance rates that at least resemble those of other applicants. If not, Brown’s holistic admissions process will continue to be little more than hot air.</span></p>

		<title>Schapiro &#039;19: BBWAA Does Half Its Job</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Back in December, I predicted that the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, when it released the results of its Hall of Fame voting Jan. 18, would “somehow screw it up.” As I watched the results come in, I was pleasantly surprised at the inductees, but vaguely annoyed at the predictable, yet no less frustrating, rejects.</p>
<p class="p2">First, the inductees. Surprising as it may be, the voters did an excellent job by finally electing Jeff Bagwell and Tim Raines, and inducting Ivan Rodriguez in his first year on the ballot. Some will bicker over Rodriguez’s first-ballot selection — “he’s not a first-ballot guy.” I give the argument little credence.</p>
<p class="p2">Similarly, there are justifiable complaints to make about the exclusion of Trevor Hoffman and Vladimir Guerrero. Hoffman’s 601 career saves, while statistically meaningless, should be worth something, and Guerrero’s career .318/.379/.553 slash line and 449 home runs, without any murmurs of steroid use, should be worth even more. But again, their omissions are no crime: both received over 70 percent of the vote, and will almost certainly be inducted next year.</p>
<p class="p2">So the BBWAA did its job and inducted three fine candidates, which explained my pleasant surprise as I watched the results unveiled. But as always with the BBWAA, there remained an undercurrent of frustration. As many players as there are that deserve induction, they can not — or will not — all get elected, so long as the BBWAA continues to operate in its current, antiquated form. As the ballot was revealed and many deserving Hall of Famers remained stuck in no-man’s land, I raised a metaphorical toast to these players.</p>
<p class="p2">Here’s to Edgar Martinez, still unelected because he was a designated hitter. He was one of the most feared hitters of his generation, and statistical experts are in near-unanimous agreement on his deserving enshrinement in Cooperstown, New York. The voters, on the other hand, are not. What does this say about their grasp of statistics?</p>
<p class="p2">Here’s to Larry Walker, whose 72.6 career Wins Above Replacement should merit a spot on their own. Walker’s OPS+, a metric measuring offensive output, is better than Jeff Bagwell’s, who received 86.2 percent of the vote. So why not Walker? Because he played at mile-high Coors Field, probably. The voters must not have examined his home/road splits — or else must think that the stadium he played in is cause enough to deny induction.</p>
<p class="p2">Here’s to Fred McGriff, whose 493 home runs during the steroid era — without suspicion of performance enhancing drug use — are impressive enough on their own, without the career .377 On-Base Percentage. McGriff has been stuck near 20 percent of the vote since he hit the ballot. That is a shame.</p>
<p class="p2">And, of course, here’s to Billy Wagner. By all available measures, Wagner is one of the greatest closers of all time. Among relief pitchers with at least 500 career innings pitched, Wagner has the second-lowest<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>earned run average of all-time behind only Mariano Rivera. He has the second-best earned-runs-average-plus (an adjusted, improved version of ERA) of all time, behind — again — only Rivera. He’s also tied for second all-time in walks plus hits by innings pitched and strikeout rate. Voters, looking at Billy Wagner, see his 422 career saves, and compare the total to Trevor Hoffman’s 601. But the save statistic, again, is meaningless. The voters’ comparative ignorance of statistical reality has already been established, but it’s especially frustrating when it keeps Billy Wagner not only out of the Hall of Fame, but also at only 10 percent of the vote.</p>
<p class="p2">There are others, of course — Mike Mussina and Curt Schilling come immediately to mind. Schilling’s support actually dropped from last year’s ballot, while most other candidates saw their support rise. Statistically, Schilling’s case is borderline. His drop in support is almost definitely attributable to his run-ins on social media (that resulted in his firing from ESPN), including tweeting a picture of a t-shirt bearing the words, “rope, tree, journalist. Some assembly required” — not a good idea when one’s candidacy is being voted on by a group of journalists.</p>
<p class="p2">Mussina, meanwhile, is a victim of the steroid era. While traditional statistics like a 3.68 ERA paint a picture of a slightly above-average pitcher, Mussina’s ERA+ of 123 and his career 82.7 WAR show a different pitcher: one who, for the era during which he pitched, was as good as or better than Juan Marichal, Bob Feller and Don Drysdale — all Hall of Famers.</p>
<p class="p2">The cases of Mussina and Schilling are borderline. The cases of Walker, Wagner and Martinez seem less so. Either way, all of these players have, in one way or another, been passed over by the BBWAA for entirely the wrong reasons.</p>
<p class="p2">So here’s to the Hall of Famers waiting at the bottom of the ballot. Here’s to the players who displayed greatness on the field, whether voters who seem no longer to understand the game noticed it or not. And here’s to their greatness one day being deservingly recognized.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The stage is set for Super Bowl LI as the Patriots return to Houston to take on relative newcomers — the Atlanta Falcons. While ESPN, NBC and other news outlets that cater to the lowest common denominator reserve the spotlight for superstars, the Patriots have played the entire second half of the season with only one player who would qualify as such: Tom Brady. Though the Patriots’ mantra “do your job” has now become cliche, the players, with small salaries and small egos, have shown an uncanny ability to embody this slogan.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bill Belichick set the tone for this team in the offseason when he traded Chandler Jones to the Arizona Cardinals. Jones had achieved star status during his four-year tenure with the Patriots by becoming a force at linebacker with an innate ability to rush the quarterback and cause turnovers. Belichick saw more value in what Jones was worth in return and traded him for guard Jonathan Cooper and a second-round pick. The Patriots then proceeded to trade that pick for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>third- and fourth-round picks, materializing in the form of lineman Joe Thuney and receiver Malcolm Mitchell. Thuney has been a constant on the line during his rookie season, playing 1,259 of 1,264 possible snaps, while Mitchell has become a reliable target for Brady, catching 26 passes for four touchdowns in the last eight games of the season. In Jones’ absence, the Patriots’ defense remained stout and surrendered the fewest points in the NFL this season.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The franchise’s 2000 era teams are often compared to the Yankees teams from 1995 to 2009 because of their extended dominance in their division. The key difference between the Patriots and Yankees is how their teams are composed. The Yankees, especially in the 2000s, were known for having the highest payroll in baseball and used their cash to sign a slew of stars, such as David Wells, Roger Clemens and Alex Rodriguez. The Patriots have taken the opposite approach, as is necessary in the salary-capped NFL. The coaching staff, led by Belichick, finds players who do not demand money or fame in order to keep each week’s focus on the team’s success rather than on a sideshow created by mouthy players or contract negotiations. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the Patriots, players like Matt Lengel, Shea McClellin and James Develin ’10 play just as important a role as the stars of the team. The lesser-known but hard-working and multifaceted players are invaluable to the schemes and looks that the Patriots use to torment their opponents. They leave open the option of receiving a pass or forcing a turnover, while distracting the opponent’s attention from the most important factors of the play. For example, in Week 15 against the Denver Broncos, the Patriots often used Develin as a decoy when Von Miller, one of Denver’s best defensive players, dropped back into coverage, forcing Miller to cover Develin and leave another Patriot open. In a play in the same game, the Patriots positioned Lengel and LeGarrette Blount out wide. This matched the two against Denver’s dangerous safeties, Aqib Talib and Chris Harris, while Julian Edelman lined up in the slot against a linebacker and caught an easy pass for a first down. These under-recognized Patriots are indispensable to the team because they are able to execute in a variety of situations, keeping New England’s opponents on their heels, second guessing their every move.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Patriots’ coaching staff has a great strength when it comes to valuing players and have had success signing cast-offs other teams had given up on. Signing these players instead of overpaid crybabies like Terrell Owens and Odell Beckham Jr. (both of whom have actually cried on camera) prevents outrageous media distractions and keeps focus on the entire team. Just as Chris Hogan emerged as a key player in the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, look out for other behind-the-scenes Patriots to be instrumental in the Super Bowl against Atlanta.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Inauguration Day, I unplugged my television, turned off the radio and avoided all of my social media accounts. Like many of my peers, I did everything I possibly could to distance myself from the reality of a Trump presidency. But that evening, when I tried to explain this to friends, all I received were blank stares.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Why are you so worried about President Trump?” I was asked time and time again. “You’re an international student; you can always just return to your home country once you graduate.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In some ways, I can understand why people would come to this conclusion. Many international students are not directly affected by the disastrous prospect of an Obamacare repeal, the institution of a regressive taxing system or the defunding of public schools across the country. At first glance, it might seem like we can sidestep many of Trump’s most absurd policy proposals. But this reasoning obscures the myriad ways in which Trump’s platform specifically undermines the status of international students and casts our futures into uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Over a <a href="http://www.iie.org/Who-We-Are/News-and-Events/Press-Center/Press-Releases/2016/2016-11-14-Open-Doors-Executive-Summary#.WID_xrYrJo5">million</a> international students currently reside in the United States, most of whom are on F-1 visas. Other students (primarily at the graduate level) and scholars come into the country on the J-1 visa program. Trump has already made a series of bold <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/10/implications-trumps-presidential-victory-international-and-undocumented-students">statements</a> proposing to place restrictions on the F-1 program and eliminate J-1 visas altogether. His team has since removed these plans from his official website, but the trend is nevertheless concerning for international students and prospective applicants alike. Given Trump’s recklessness and tendency to tilt at windmills, we can never be sure when our legality in this country will be called into question.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Then there’s the issue of employment visas for summer internships and jobs after graduation. To legally reside in the country for paid summer internships, international students have to enroll in either the Optional Practical Training program or the Curricular Practical Training program. The eligibility requirements for these programs could become much more rigorous under the new <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/873991/the-biggest-immigration-regulations-of-2016">administration</a>, disadvantaging international students who face particular <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/04/19/mitra-18-what-about-international-internships/">difficulties</a> finding internships in the first place .</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This problem will likely be compounded for full-time employment visas. The H1-B visa process is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/education/edlife/should-foreign-graduates-get-a-visa-edge.html?_r=0">notorious</a> for its lack of transparency and clarity, but recent debates in Congress suggest that it is likely to get a lot worse. Republican lawmakers have already introduced a bill in Congress that tightens <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2017/01/06/h-1b-visas-u-s-lawmaker-re-introduces-bill-to-tighten-rules/">requirements</a> for H1-B visas. With the potential for even more restrictions and limits under Trump’s “buy American, hire American” <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/politics/donald-trump-terry-branstad-china-des-moines-iowa-rally/">policies</a>, many companies may decide against hiring international students because of the added hassle and uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Admittedly, most international students have the option to return to their home countries for employment, and many will undoubtedly do so. But the majority of Brown students find jobs through resources like BrownConnect, CareeerLab alerts, alumni networks and campus recruitment — resources that primarily offer opportunities based in the United States. As the process currently stands, restrictions to the H1-B process will stand in the way of many international students’ best shot at employment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And these policy changes do not even account for the elephant in the room. We must not forget that the new president has based his campaign on unabashed xenophobia and bigotry. The Southern Poverty Law Center recorded a rising number of hate <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/12/28/schooling-hate/K5jcUAEF7cBazFsBOvUVXL/story.html">crimes</a> against minorities and foreign citizens on the streets and in colleges. Of course, the growth of intolerance affects many other demographics — minorities, women and members of the LGBTQ community, to name a few. But international students are also vulnerable to Trump’s anti-immigration policies and the waves of hate that come with them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It should come as no surprise that analysts are already predicting a record <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/us/is-it-safe-foreign-students-consider-college-in-donald-trumps-us.html?_r=0">drop</a> in international applicants and enrollees under Trump. Yet, despite the baseless rhetoric portraying international students as poachers of American jobs, they are valuable assets to the education system and country. They bring in an estimated $32 billion a year, add to the skilled labor force and offer important and diverse perspectives on college campuses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since we can no longer count on the government, it’s up to colleges like Brown to make international students feel safe and supported on campuses. Brown has already made a start: In the days following the election, the Office of Global Engagement and the Office of International Student and Scholar Services hosted an international community gathering and sent out a series of email updates and resources. They also organized an information session with an immigration attorney to discuss how the election might affect immigration law. I hope the University maintains these activities and keeps a close eye on new policies that could affect international students. A simple first step could be to expand advising for jobs and graduate school programs abroad. Even a small-scale change like hosting more visa information sessions could make a world of difference in this climate of uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After all, we’ll all be irrevocably affected by a Trump presidency. Even those of us who are not American.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though you may not engage in it, speed walking down Thayer with fingers flexing across a lit rectangular screen has become a recognizable sport. We participants adopt our own rhythms: timed glances upward to make sure we avoid an embarrassing crash, swift transitions from one app to another, a quick smile to acknowledge a passing lab partner absorbed in the same activity. Personally, NitroCart is often the only thing important enough to interrupt my intense downward gape. But this column is not about how we spend too much time on our smartphones. There is just one specific behavior we could consider altering — obsessive planning made easy via our devices.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For me, this realization hit home last semester. While sitting on the Main Green one day, alternating between texting about lunch plans and surveying recent emails about an upcoming club meeting, I failed to notice that the friends sitting near me had started to disperse. I glanced up, noticed their absence and then promptly retreated back to my invitingly bright screen.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this moment, I encountered a literal manifestation of one of my mother’s constant reminders: “Life is what happens when you are busy making other plans.” This sudden awareness continued to bother me for days after.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our all-consuming obsession with scheduling — facilitated by modern-day technology — creates a cycle. At the very lunch I was planning that day, I am sure I pulled out my phone to see who was at the Rock to join afterwards. At the club meeting later that night, there is no doubt that I mindlessly clicked off “Interested” to some events that emerged on my Facebook news feed. Given the ease of planning via our limb-like devices, our attention is constantly pulled from the present and into the future. If the present is always about planning for the future, at what point do we reap the benefits of all this organizing?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This question is more pressing than ever because technology has simplified and streamlined our ability to regiment our time. If you are like me, a visceral tendency to avidly plan coupled with the many virtual organization tools at hand will leave you all too susceptible to plotting every hour of the week. My own relationship with Google Calendar began in the early weeks of my time at Brown, per a trusty Meiklejohn’s recommendation. Turning a stickered laptop toward me in the Blue Room, she proudly presented a screen reminiscent of Tetris and gushed, “I don’t know where I’d be without this.” It wasn’t long until I felt the same attachment. Everything from “long shower” to “Blue Room muffin” seemed to accumulate the force of commandments when added to my virtual schedule. Whether or not they were arbitrarily created on Sunday night — when I had no way of foreseeing when I would be hungry or in need of hot water pressure during the week — became irrelevant.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In theory, this doesn’t sound that bad: Technology makes organizing our lives easier than ever, and there is a clear comfort in a reliable cycle of events. But this comes at the cost of spontaneity. More importantly, there are those moments lost in planning the moments ahead. While I’ve long accepted my own lack of impulsiveness, it took that realization for me to consider how my virtual plan-making might be shortchanging me of my ability to enjoy the current colored slot on my Google Calender.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I don’t think we should surrender virtual scheduling altogether. Likewise, I cringe at idyllic “shut-off-your-phone-entirely” preaching — this suggestion is as unthinkable to me as my parents’ recommendations to take a math class. But what I do consider an achievable and worthwhile goal this year is to quit arranging plans when we are in the middle of them. Don’t message your mom about Thanksgiving break as your club’s president is speaking, and suppress the urge to confirm an online dinner reservation while sitting across from someone else at the lunch table. Save all of the virtual planning — whether it be RSVPing to events on Facebook or texting a classmate about studying later — for moments of solitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Make this your 2017 resolution, and tackle your general smartphone addiction next year.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">During this moment of great political uncertainty in our country, including the recent signing of various executive orders and possible policy changes ahead affecting education and research, we must be vigilant and deliberate in upholding our core values as a university.</p>
<p class="p2">Last Tuesday, in conjunction with our Reaffirming University Values series, we gathered approximately 100 concerned Brown faculty members to discuss Brown’s core values and how they will inform our work as a community moving forward. We stressed our unwavering commitment to fully support members of our community and to protect their unfettered capacity to engage in teaching, research and the free and open exchange of ideas.</p>
<p class="p2">We feel it is an important moment to articulate the values and principles that will guide Brown as we advocate to preserve and sustain the core of what we do and navigate the uncertainty ahead. These include the following:</p>
<p class="p2">— Our firm commitment to the advancement of knowledge, fact-based scientific inquiry and scholarship across the full breadth of disciplines represented at Brown. The principles of fact- and reason-based inquiry are key to how we understand, analyze and address the most difficult challenges we face as a society.</p>
<p class="p2">— Our uncompromising conviction that for our University community to excel in creating knowledge and preparing leaders, we must maintain a community in which ideas can be freely developed, expressed and contested in a rational and respectful manner.</p>
<p class="p2">— Our insistence that individual students and scholars are free to pursue their scholarship and learning without fear of intimidation or discrimination based on their identities, backgrounds, areas or methods of scholarship and social or political views.</p>
<p class="p2">— Our unconditional rejection of every form of bigotry, discrimination, xenophobia and harassment.</p>
<p class="p2">Last week’s faculty discussion centered on areas of grave concern — from the immediate and operational to the philosophical and existential. Among the issues raised were challenges to research, especially focused on environmental change and reproductive health; immigration and the targeting of students and scholars from predominantly Muslim countries; and a broad range of concerns related to civil rights, harassment and hate crimes.</p>
<p class="p2">When we met with faculty to discuss these issues at that early point in the new Congress and presidential administration, we could only speculate on what the future might bring. Therefore, in addition to stressing our strong commitment to support members of our community, we also shared information on the range of resources in place across the University to monitor relevant legislation and policies at all levels of government; join with our peer institutions to advocate for issues of importance to our mission; and support our faculty, students and staff under any range of scenarios, such as threats to academic freedom and incidents of bias, discrimination or harassment.</p>
<p class="p2">A test to our values came faster than we had expected. Only a few days after our meeting, a new executive order has compromised the visa status of Brown community members from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. A team of Brown administrators is gathering information and providing much-needed guidance and assistance to affected members of our community. Just as we continue to support our undocumented students and students with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, we will do everything in our power to ensure that these valued members of our community can continue their research, teaching and learning at Brown.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown stands in support of the letter issued Saturday by the Association of American Universities, of which Brown is a member. That letter urged the current administration “as soon as possible, to make clear to the world that the United States continues to welcome the most talented individuals from all countries to study, teach, and carry out research and scholarship at our universities.”</p>
<p class="p2">During this time of uncertainty, it is essential that we reinforce our mission and our values, and continue to do what we do best — promote learning, truth and justice.</p>
<p class="p2">Every member of our community has a role to play. We look forward to working together to uphold and reaffirm our values.</p>
<p class="p4"><em>Christina Paxson P’19 is the president of Brown University and Richard Locke is Brown’s provost. They can be reached at president@brown.edu and provost@brown.edu, respectively.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Dear Jesse Watters,</p>
<p class="p2">Last week you visited your favorite campus to interview students about toxic masculinity and the Women’s March. Many students found your visit polarizing, to say the least. You broke one of my Facebook group chats, that’s for sure. Several of my friends got to talk to you and were asked questions that eventually became a piece that many, including myself, found humorous. After all, there are clips of you skating down College Hill. Who skates past the age of 30?</p>
<p class="p2">You <a href="https://twitter.com/jessebwatters/status/783778709182550016?lang=en">tweeted</a> back in October that you are a “political humorist,” and that your segments are “intended to be a light piece.” But that’s the thing about humor. Humor works because it either alienates or validates an audience; we either laugh with someone or laugh at someone. I am reminded of your last piece that went viral, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJmnLzw8NA4">Watters’ World: Chinatown Edition</a>,” as an example of the latter. When you play “Kung Fu Fighting” or fake bow to someone in Chinatown who doesn’t speak English that’s definitely not laughing with them. You said on <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/fox-news-jesse-watters-sort-apologizes-making-fun--243743">Twitter</a> that offense taken from the segment fills you with regret. I don’t want regret. I want an apology.</p>
<p class="p2">You remember when you came to Sex Power God, right? It’s that <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/11/15/fox-news-airs-footage-of-sex-power-god/">segment</a> where you, a thirty-something at the time, filmed a bunch of college students making out and then broadcast it on national television without their approval. The clip was offensive to a lot of people. So, while we no longer hold Sex Power God at Brown, you will forever be intrinsically linked to it in my mind. In fact, up until this week, you were Butt-Naked Guy in my head.</p>
<p class="p2">As you might be able to tell, I am trying to be funny about a topic many people took seriously in the hope that it will change your mind about how you handled that situation. See? Useful humor.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, as The Herald has <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/11/15/fox-news-airs-footage-of-sex-power-god/">reported</a>, you were within the legal boundaries to film and publish interviews with students. Sometimes I even welcome your televised segments. Call us out on our lack of knowledge of political topics and policy. Hold us to a higher standard. What I can’t support is using footage to mock us special snowflakes, laughingly point out our supposed ignorance for strangers nationwide or paint a picture that isn’t true. Like an alternative fact, I suppose.</p>
<p class="p2">Comedy is a fickle tool when dealing with the hot-button issues of today. It’s hard to find an audience to laugh about sensitive topics and even harder to find someone to tell the joke. For topics like toxic masculinity, you can try to use humor to bridge a gap between those who smirk at safe spaces and those who may actually need them. Parts of your segment were funny to me, but I was left dissatisfied. Humor at its best minimizes harms while attempting to create change, and I didn’t find your comedy particularly effective at either.</p>
<p class="p2">I’m not going to lie: The left has a problem with alienating humor, too, possibly because the Republican Party gives them so much material to work with (so, so much). Late-night hosts mock and shame the right, most of the entire entertainment industry does the same and the modern conservative is left out in the cold. Aziz Ansari put it best in his recent Saturday Night Live monologue: “Some people are like, ‘Everyone that voted for Trump is a dumb racist, misogynist, (and) homophobe.’ Hold on. We’re talking about 63 million people. You know? Don’t judge them by their worst.”</p>
<p class="p2">And so, Jesse Watters, despite a track record I can’t possibly condone, I won’t judge you by your worst. But I do ask you to consider what purpose your humor, which is televised in thousands of homes, serves. Your colleague Bill O’Reilly said, “We do this … because we want to.” Hold yourself to a better standard than that. I wonder how many people felt like they were laughing with you on Saturday’s segment. I wonder if anyone learned to empathize with different opinions. I wonder how many people felt alienated, or worse, vindicated to continue their own harmful agendas after watching you on that television.</p>
<p class="p2">Huh. Maybe I should go out on the streets and ask.</p>

		<title>Smith GS: Is graduate student unionization worthwhile?</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/01/30/smith-gs-graduate-student-unionization-worthwhile/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last summer, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that graduate students at private colleges and universities in the United States have the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/08/23/grad-students-at-private-schools-win-right-to-unionize/">right to unionize</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">The decision marked a historic turning point for graduate students, granting them collective bargaining rights and legal status as employees.</p>
<p class="p2">Graduate students at Brown responded to the ruling by forming a group called Stand Up for Graduate Student Employment. SUGSE’s primary goal is to convince a majority of graduate students at Brown to vote in favor of unionization. They argue that unionization will empower graduate students by giving them leverage to negotiate the terms of their working relationship with the university.</p>
<p class="p2">Forming a union has the potential to help graduate students make important gains. Paid leave, child-care compensation, defined time commitments for teaching assistantships and formal channels for filing grievances would significantly benefit graduate students, and a union would be an effective means for achieving these ends.</p>
<p class="p2">But the risk of the unionization debate is that it distracts graduate students from the more ominous, systemic problem confronting them: the lack of employment opportunities in academia. Doctoral students in the humanities are most dramatically affected by this problem; STEM doctoral students and master’s students have a broader range of employment opportunities outside of academia and do not feel the suffocating lack of academic employment as much as humanities doctoral students. The Modern Language Association <a href="https://mlaresearch.mla.hcommons.org/2015/02/17/where-are-they-now-occupations-of-1996-2011-phd-recipients-in-2013-2/">estimates </a>that only one-third of humanities students who earned their PhD between 1996 and 2011 are currently tenured academic faculty.</p>
<p class="p2">The issue of post-graduate employment is conspicuously absent from the unionization discussion. Full-time, salaried employment after graduation is what graduate students need most, especially humanities doctoral students. Graduate students should be wary of devoting time and energy to unionizing, given the more pressing problem of post-graduate employment looming on the horizon. It isn’t worth re-upholstering the living room furniture if there’s a gas leak in the basement.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown’s graduate students should engage the University and advocate for themselves. But they should select the issues that are important to them carefully. If the unionization vote passes and graduate students bargain only for incremental improvements to their compensation packages, they will be selling themselves short and letting the University off the hook. Brown can afford slightly higher stipends and dental insurance for graduate students. It cannot afford to hire them as full professors. A graduate student union should confront the University about post-graduate employment prospects directly; it should not skirt around the issue by fighting for small-scale gains.</p>
<p class="p2">The issue of post-graduate employment is too daunting for most humanities doctoral students to want to address. Nobody talks about it. Everyone, on the other hand, talks about unionization. Unionization is tenable. There are definitive steps to take to achieve it. It instills a feeling of power, of control over one’s destiny, of voice. Employment prospects instill a sense of fear. It often feels like the unionization conversation is a convenient substitute for the more pressing employment conversation that isn’t happening.</p>
<p class="p2">Unionization may be a good starting point, a platform from which graduate students can launch and — over time — advocate for deliberate steps to increase their chances of securing post-graduate employment. Allocating resources for job placement officers, seminars on navigating the job market and individualized career guidance could be issues that a union eventually addresses. These issues should be at the forefront of the current unionization conversation.</p>
<p class="p2">But discussing these issues would also force SUGSE to discuss the limits of unionizing. What could a union offer to a newly-minted PhD who has just finished their program at Brown, is no longer affiliated with the University and is entering the job market for the first time? This is perhaps the most vulnerable moment for doctoral students and also the one at which the union would be unable to provide assistance.</p>
<p class="p2">Graduate students, especially humanities doctoral students, should be wary of feeling that unionization would significantly improve their status. As long as they continue to teach for comparatively minimal wages, the University comes out way ahead. And even with the protection of a union, the University has no financial incentive to help graduate students find post-graduate employment. As long as that is the case, graduate students are more or less on their own.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The rise to stardom of political commentator Tomi Lahren is hard to ignore — her inflammatory statements light up social media and emblazon rightwing millennial voters looking for a fresh face to carry a conservative message. And not unlike President Donald Trump, Lahren knows the power of a tweet. Using as few characters as possible, she has <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3683567/Conservative-host-Tomi-Lahren-fire-calling-Black-Lives-Matter-new-KKK-critics-say-comments-reckless.html">likened</a> the Black Lives Matter movement to the KKK, called liberals “<a href="https://twitter.com/tomilahren/status/804189044389376000?lang=en">snowflakes</a>” and accused the Obama administration of being sympathetic toward terrorists. There’s no doubt that rightwing princess Tomi Lahren, who has her own show on TheBlaze, has gathered a large millennial following with her passionate approach to politics. But is Lahren truly the spokeswoman for the forgotten men and women of the America heartland as she so proudly claims to be? Or rather, is she a mouthpiece for the same old political forces afraid of change and inclusion? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Political debate is a cornerstone of the American democratic system. Lahren is absolutely right to question those in power and demand more from her elected officials. She is also right to question the mainstream media’s bias throughout the presidential election. But when attacks on people, movements and belief systems are rooted in fundamental misconceptions, Lahren’s thirst for controversy is no longer conducive to engaging conversation and instead fuels misguided anger.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As has been painfully obvious throughout this election cycle, political discourse is no longer solely about differences of opinion regarding the role of government. It’s personal. Lahren doesn’t consider her liberal counterparts as intellectual equals but rather condescendingly refers to them as “snowflakes.” Apparently, these liberals are too fragile and sensitive to cope with the brutal truths doled out by Trump.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lahren maintains that the label of “racist” has been thrown around so often in this election cycle that it no longer has any meaning and that liberals use the term indiscriminately when their comebacks come up short. But she is completely comfortable throwing around the label “snowflake” whenever she deems fit. On her show, Lahren dismisses the Black Lives Matter movement as a collection of angry snowflakes disrespecting the police force without a legitimate reason. A history of racism, police brutality and mass incarceration don’t get mentioned. The complexity of the movement — and the history of race in the United States — doesn’t fit well into her simple, angry narrative. When Lahren casually likened the Black Lives Matter movement to the KKK, it led me to believe that Lahren is either unaware of what the KKK stands for or she is simply indifferent to it. But that’s the thing — Lahren doesn’t need to care about facts or nuances so long as her fans gobble up her outlandish and controversial claims. She simply basks in the backlash. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a guest on the Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Lahren was asked a legitimate question: What is the right way for black people to protest? Lahren claims to be personally offended by Colin Kaepernick’s decision to exercise his right not to stand during the national anthem. But she also claims the Black Lives Matter movement is illegitimate due to several members’ decision to protest violently. Unsurprisingly, the always-passionate Lahren was unable to answer the question. She responded instead with a tangential, spirited defense of the flag and skepticism as to whether black people face oppression at all. For a woman who claims to love America for its freedoms, she is oddly bothered by a man’s silent protest against his oppressor. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The biggest problem with Lahren isn’t that she lacks nuance and well-reasoned attacks. Lahren fights opposing arguments with blind outrage and unadmitted privilege. She arms her followers with unfounded and racially charged arguments instead of practicing thoughtful reporting and effectively addressing pressing political concerns. Why should you care? Lahren isn’t simply muttering angry extremist beliefs to herself — she influences millions of viewers, has 585,000 followers on Twitter and is now essentially a part of the mainstream media. To make matters worse, Lahren is an active fearmonger, offering a narrative of exclusion rather than what the country really needs — hope and optimism.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Knowing that the rightwing princess hates labels, I’ll refrain from adding one here and put it bluntly instead: I wish Lahren’s only problem were her one-sided arguments. Unfortunately, she possess neither the skills nor the empathy that her platform demands. </span></p>

		<title>Krishnamurthy ’19: One last slam</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tennis is the sort of sport, like soccer, that hasn’t quite managed to intoxicate Americans the way, say, football or basketball have. It is, after all, a European import, lacking any of the violent drama or masculine desperation that characterize much of American sports. Indeed, tennis matches feel less like conflicts and more like performances of ballet — graceful, elegant and, without fail, superlatively decent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last Sunday morning, while most Americans were still asleep, that show of decency and austere pursuit of excellence was on full display during the finals of the Australian Open. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal — the unforgettable elder statesmen of tennis — had both staged improbable comebacks, overcoming injuries and a slate of healthier opponents to reach the final round. Federer had not won a Grand Slam since Wimbledon in 2012 and was fresh off a six-month break from the tour; Nadal had ended his 2016 season early, thanks to a disappointing recovery (though he managed to make a comeback for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro). That these two rivals would face-off once again, perhaps for the last time, in the finals of a Grand Slam tournament was a much-needed miracle.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Federer and Nadal are no strangers to each other. Their careers are intimately entwined; before the final, they had played 34 times, with Nadal leading their head-to-head record 23-11. From 2006 to 2008, they enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the tour, playing in the finals of every French Open and Wimbledon. In January 2017, Federer and Nadal (both above the age of 30) played as if their age and physical decay were mere fictions — as if the clocks could be turned at will back to their glorious primes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The match itself was deserving of the anticipation. Federer effortlessly dished out his famous forehands and Nadal exhibited his ferocious style of play. In the fifth set, Federer found himself down three games to none, and clawed his way back to win the match with a forehand winner. It was classic tennis — the kind that leaves you in sequence, crestfallen, energized, disappointed and, at the very end, in absolute awe.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But that isn’t why I found the Australian Open finals so invigorating. Good tennis — good athletics, really — can be found anywhere. The match didn’t just offer a magnificent piece of athletic achievement, it offered something far scarcer: decency. It was this decency, this profound acknowledgement of mutual dependence, that animated the play of archrivals Federer and Nadal and really got to me. In his acceptance of the winner’s trophy, Federer said, “Tennis is a tough sport. There are no draws, but if there were, I would have been happy to share it with Rafa.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My heart melted when I heard that. Whose wouldn’t? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In moments of crisis and hardship, it is tough to find reasons to believe that humans — endowed with an inexorable fascination with cruelty — are capable of redemption. Our societies are too divided to promote an inclusive vision. Our leaders are too good at marshaling our worst instincts. And, too often, our governments enable us to indulge those instincts, scot-free. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this time of uncertainty and disaffection, the Australian Open provided a short relief: the resplendent resurgence of old champions, battered by their age and competition, yet thoroughly unwilling to yield to the forces that haunt them. There is, of course, a subtle lesson in all this. We may not be perfect; we will stumble and fall and suffer grave disappointments. But the measure of our decency stems not from where we are now, but how humbly we admit our shortcomings, and how scrappily we claw our way to where we wish to go. The match is a telling reminder that we can rise above our differences, rivalries and innate competitiveness with grace and compassion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After winning his semifinal match, Federer told an <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/01/26/roger-federer-sets-up-the-unthinkable-with-rafael-nadal/">interviewer</a> that, when he was in Mallorca a couple of months ago for the opening of Nadal’s tennis school, “I was on one leg. (Nadal) had the wrist injury. And we were playing some mini-tennis with some juniors and we’re like, ‘This is the best we can do right now.’” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thank God that wasn’t true.</span></p>

		<title>Shemano ’19: The perils of executive overreach</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/02/shemano-19-perils-executive-overreach/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the wake of President Donald Trump’s recent executive actions, it’s time to talk about the system and precedent that affords him the power to circumvent Congress and create policy unilaterally. You may be surprised to hear that when the legality of Trump’s executive orders goes to court, the Trump administration will not only cite U.S. code, but also cite former President Barack Obama’s policy and precedent.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The least talked about and arguably most important aspect of Obama’s legacy was his immense expansion of executive power. Undoubtedly, Obama has handed his successor a presidency even more powerful and dangerous than the one he inherited from former President George W. Bush.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I understand the inevitable criticism of this point: Blame over historical records is not as immediately important as surviving the crisis at hand and instituting reforms as soon as possible. But in order to survive this crisis and institute necessary reforms, we must understand the system in place that has provided the current president power that no president has ever held before. My purpose is not to make a pointed critique of Obama, but rather to start a conversation on the system that gave Trump the reach he has today. Unless we confront the system, rather than just our political opponents, nothing will change.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 2010, few were outspoken about the potential consequences of the expansion in executive power. In fact, many might have even invited it as a progressive and useful tool. Faced with unfair gridlock for years, Obama embraced executive orders as a means of creating law. For example, he expanded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/us/politics/obama-era-legacy-regulation.html">regulations</a> in order to protect the environment and attempted to pass executive amnesty to <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/20/fact-sheet-immigration-accountability-executive-action">protect millions of undocumented immigrants</a>. To many of us, these policies represent positive change — a far cry from the executive actions we have seen emerge from the White House in the last 10 days.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many of us at Brown are supporters of Obama and considered him as honorable a president as we’ve ever had. I agree that Obama is an extremely intelligent, genuinely good person with a heart in the right place. But, just like all presidents before him, Obama was never going to stay in the White House forever. The danger with allowing the unchecked expansion of executive power is that somewhere down the line, someone with authoritative inclinations and an unclear moral code could take control.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For example, Obama’s executive unilateralism could very well end up providing the platform for Trump’s plan for mass deportations. The Trump administration will have access to the identities and information of all Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals participants who were <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-order-immigrants-privacy-20170127-story.html">required to submit their personal information</a> to benefit from the program. This could be used by the administration to more efficiently execute a mass deportation. DACA, a well-intentioned executive order, could now be used to facilitate a humanitarian disaster — a truly terrifying prospect.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This reflects the fundamental shortsightedness of the political establishment. The Democrats in power assumed that, after Obama, another leader who shared his philosophy would be elected to lead. With this mindset, they oversaw the immense expansion of presidential power. They expanded the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">surveillance state</a>, allowed the president to go to war without <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/world/africa/22powers.html">congressional authorization</a> and enacted secret deep state “<a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/07/23/blacklisted/">terror lists</a>” (which not only authorize indiscriminate surveillance of people under certain “categories,” but also do so without due process). Trump will also be in charge of the massively expanded <a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/">drone program</a> — a lethal, targeted killing system. The list goes on and on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is true that Obama has signed fewer executive orders than many <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/orders.php">past presidents</a>. Yet it is not the quantity, but the specifics of Obama’s executive orders that have set the stage for Trump’s current scope of power. Instead of signing executive orders to enact symbolic and administrative measures (their intended use), Obama used the executive order as a means of expanding executive power, overriding a Republican-majority Congress and <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/obama.html">creating policy</a>. It is unquestionable that the size and scope of presidential power increased <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/us/politics/obama-era-legacy-regulation.html">dramatically under Obama</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trump’s election is now a wake up call to all those who supported Obama’s use of executive powers. For the next four years, Trump will enjoy a presidency far more powerful than it was ever intended to be. So long as the Republicans hold congressional majorities, it will be difficult to stop him.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But this doesn’t mean we can’t learn from the past. We should be vigilant in exposing the institutions and systems of government that gave him these powers. This means scrutinizing and voting out of office the establishment politicians from both parties who encouraged the expansion of executive power. It means lobbying for the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups who have consistently denounced the growth of executive power. Most importantly, it means holding a future president accountable if they attempt to increase executive power, even if we agree with the policies they create under that power.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Misery loves company. This saying is as old as humanity. Communities have come together in times of grief as far back as we know. When times are hard, we band together to sympathize, to comfort and often to identify a common enemy. This year the forum for much of that grief was online via social media, and the common enemy was the year 2016 itself. Online, 2016 was anthropomorphized into a scapegoat for an outpouring of fear and confusion that felt endless. Memes, the recurring cultural touchstones that use humor to go viral, became almost a national pastime. Countless articles portrayed 2016 as a force that aged us all, the year that every Onion article came true. No one came out of 2016 quite the same. In a way, this characterization was perfect. It gave us the ability to consolidate disparate and upsetting events in one place, from the election to celebrity deaths to killer clowns. In addition to its convenience, this depiction was optimistic; a year must end, after all, breaking the curse. It’s easy label a set period of time as beyond the pale.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m no anthropologist, but I do read a lot of Buzzfeed articles, so here’s my take: The meme-ification of 2016 was not caused by chaotic current events alone. Rather, we’re living in a time when isolation and pain can be digitally packaged and made shareable — ironically, of course. On the one hand, this seems to be a healthy break from the way that social media is often used to display a greatest-hits selection of one’s life, from carefully curated Instagrams and Snapchat stories to posts about personal achievements. Sharing or tagging a friend in a meme about being lonely, scared or overwhelmed is a type of honesty that’s rarely found on these platforms. But the inevitable backlash of this kind of transparency occurs when pictures of Kermit the Frog replace complex emotions and when humor, though often a great outlet for negative emotions, becomes the only available outlet, either online or offline. When current events are turned into memes, it’s nearly impossible to remember the significance they held in the first place. The death of Harambe in May 2016 was upsetting for many animal rights activists, as well as a source of pain for those wondering why the killings of people of color garnered far less media attention. But the meme of Harambe, which was almost inescapable that summer, took sincere expressions of grief and turned them into jokes — the more sincere, the funnier. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On the opposite note, so-called “wholesome” memes, or memes that derived their humor from positivity, developed as a counterculture. Pictures of Bill Clinton playing with balloons at the Democratic National Convention and of Barack Obama and Joe Biden united in a bromance caught on as welcome reprieves from the persistent negativity. Still, the fact that wholesome memes have come into a category of their own accurately sums up the general mood of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Perhaps the strangest effect, and maybe the most harmful, of 2016’s meme-ification is the barrage of online dark humor and self-deprecation. The first time I really considered the potential harm of this blurring of public and private emotion was, unsurprisingly, at the end of a Buzzfeed article. The article itself was a list of jokes, but at the end the author provided links to mental health resources — just in case anyone actually felt the emotions that everyone was jokingly expressing online. In providing these resources, one could argue that Buzzfeed recognized its role in facilitating a culture of irony that overlooks mental health challenges and was going out of its way to counteract it. But more than that, Buzzfeed’s inclusion of these resources was the culmination of the strangeness of our time, when we laugh to keep from crying and crying makes us laugh.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I haven’t even begun to delve here into the more sinister corners of internet humor, into websites like 4chan where the alt-right thrives, and I don’t plan to. The story of how Donald Trump’s youngest and most radical supporters capitalized on these message boards to build a culture of meme-ified hatred — in which racism and anti-Semitism go unchecked in an echo chamber — has been well-documented since the election. But even far from these extreme corners of the web, it was hard to escape unscathed from both the real 2016 and its online presence. While policing internet culture is not an easy or necessarily worthwhile task to attempt, it is important to more thoughtfully consider the forms of media that many of us consume passively every day. Thanks to its ubiquity and unprecedented relevance this past year, digital culture shapes our outlooks whether we notice it or not. And the subconscious, repeated exposure to self-deprecation and repressive irony has the potential to wither us more than 2016 ever did.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">In the fifth grade, I applied to become a news anchor for my elementary school’s morning news show, “Good Morning Centennial Elementary.” The show’s anchors discussed the lunch menu and weather on a daily broadcast to every classroom in the school. The selection process was actually quite extensive, and the application required a level of introspection that, at the time, my ten-year-old mind was not capable of. The final question of the application required me to write the name of my role model. I thought about writing down “my dad,” but after giving it further thought, I filled in “Warren Buffett,” celebrated investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. To my surprise, I actually didn’t get the anchor job; I became the cameraman instead. Though I think my teachers were floored by the fact I knew who Warren Buffett was at age 10, I also suspect that they viewed my responses as overly materialistic and status-seeking.</p>
<p class="p3">Nine years later, as I sit down to declare my applied math-economics concentration, I fear that my academic intentions are still in flux. In an effort to cultivate meaningful hobbies that would provide me with role models outside of finance, I took up folding origami sculptures, playing piano, and running on the cross-country team in middle and high school. But it is probably not a coincidence that these activities looked great on the Common Application. While I cast myself as a service-minded urban studies concentrator in my supplement essays to Brown, I am now adding a concentration in the more materialistic discipline of applied-math economics. I sought, between fifth grade and now, to redefine the person I wanted to become, but I’m afraid that my infatuation with the idea of “Warren Buffett” and conventional success has only become more entrenched.</p>
<p class="p3">Perhaps, as an applicant, I presented a version of myself with whom I no longer identify. Or maybe I never fully understood my goals in the first place. The immersive nature of my college experience has fundamentally altered the goals and aspirations I held for myself before I moved away from home. But this same sort of transformation happens to lots of other college students. Goals change based on context.</p>
<p class="p3">As it turns out, even presidents are subject to the same sort of transformations, though perhaps for the worse. As a presidential candidate, President Donald Trump made certain promises to energize the conservative base. Then, as soon as he secured his title as president, he was granted the freedom to indulge impulses he had been forced to suppress during the campaign trail. Just as it’s likely that Brown wasn’t looking for another future employee of the financial services industry, Trump’s voters didn’t want another member of the establishment in the White House.</p>
<p class="p3">After reading the news since Jan. 20, I can’t help but see an identity crisis reflected in the recent actions of President Trump. The president has, for better or for worse, followed through on specific promises he made on the campaign trail — the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the revocation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, building the wall between Mexico and the United States and nominating a conservative Supreme Court justice — but his recent policy actions are neither conservative nor liberal. Two years ago, Paul Ryan publicly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/08/paul-ryan-on-donald-trump-this-is-not-conservatism/">stated</a> that Trump’s Muslim ban “is not conservatism.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Trump’s border wall is perhaps the opposite of conservative, as it may cost American consumers a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/politics/donald-trump-mexico-import-tax-border-wall/">20 percent tariff </a>on imports. And, at the same time, Trump toes the Republican line by supporting the repeal of Obamacare and nominating ultra-conservative judge Neil Gorsuch. It seems that the only common thread between Trump’s policy actions is that they are isolationist, xenophobic and empty.</p>
<p class="p3">Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” of Washington, D.C. has proven entirely false, following his nomination of Rex Tillerson, Exxon-Mobil CEO, and Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive, to his cabinet. Yet Trump delivered a populist manifesto for his <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/trump-inaugural-speech-analysis/513956/">inaugural address</a> on Jan. 20, declaring that he is “transferring power from Washington, D.C.” and “giving it back” to the people. How he can make such a claim after nominating wealthy CEO’s with almost no government experience to his cabinet is beyond me. Trump, despite his claims to rid Washington of elitism, cannot deny his obvious roots in the world of business and political aristocrats. In the end, we are who we are.</p>
<p class="p3">But even to his own voters, Trump remains an enigma. Trump voters, paradoxically dismayed when the president follows through on specific campaign trail promises, have taken to Twitter to express their concerns. A new Twitter account, Trump Regrets, which catalogs these unlikely sentiments, has already collected 187,000 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/05/trump-regrets-twitter-voters-election-ashamed">followers</a>. Trump has chosen to follow through on certain campaign promises and completely renege on others, and this lack of transparency and predictability is causing Americans — and the world — an unprecedented level of distress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Either American voters elected a version of Donald Trump he no longer represents or elected him based on falsehoods.</p>
<p class="p3">I admit that my personal attempt to redefine myself, under pressure from the college environment, revealed itself to be more reversible than I once thought. But I can forgive myself with the knowledge that I am a college student whose peers are most likely undergoing similar changes of heart. On the other hand, many Americans won’t be able to forgive Trump for his lack of a clear political ideology or the fact that he has already betrayed promises that once gave so many hope.</p>

		<title>Bielenberg ’20: ‘International’ is not a race</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“International” is not a race. So why is data collated for such a heterogeneous group? <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-research/factbook/enrollment">Brown’s Office of Institutional Research</a> classifies students according to racial categories such as white, black, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native and International. The equation of these disparate categories is particularly striking when presented visually. Last semester, I was reading an article in The Herald when I noticed a pie chart representing “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/11/01/dps-seeks-better-diversity-community-outreach-efforts/">diversity at Brown</a>.” In illustrations like this one, “International” has the same shape and form — and, by implication, the same significance — as “Asian,” “white” or “black.” The OIR’s explanation of these categories online is quite terse: “The race and ethnicity of U.S. citizens or permanent residents are reported; citizens of other countries are reported as ‘international.’” Why is the consideration of non-American students’ race and ethnicity so perfunctory?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The fact that the Office of Institutional Research uses the same categories as the <a href="http://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html">United States Census Bureau</a> lends a patina of governmental authority to the data. But no type of authority can or should eliminate our duty to critically examine the categories we use. Even if we are accustomed to using certain labels, we must examine just how appropriate the labels really are. In this case, it is clear that the categories we use are insufficient to accurately describe the diversity of the Brown community.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Using these labels without careful consideration leads to glaring omissions and oversimplification. It is preposterous to differentiate between an American of Pakistani, Haitian and Navajo descent while subsuming every South African, Canadian and Brazilian student into one racial category. Having U.S. citizenship does not magically change the barriers a person of color will face in a society dominated by white privilege. Moreover, part of the reason we collect racial and ethnic data is to reflect our diverse experiences as we navigate society. By including people with vastly different experiences — many of them precisely due to race and ethnicity — in a single category, the label “International” falls short of this goal.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This use of the label “International” is emblematic of our broader lack of engagement with the relationship between international experiences and American racial paradigms. I have noticed this from personal experience: I am an American citizen who graduated from high school outside the United States. The types of racial discourse I am most familiar with are different from those most common in the United States — though they are often just as charged and significant. The Brown community frequently considers the complex dynamics of race entrenched in our daily experiences, but we often assume that participants in this discourse share a background and vocabulary. For example, ubiquitous terms like “Asian American,” “African American” and “Native American” only make sense when those concerned share an American background. The paradigm shift can be bewildering to international students; an incoming freshman is suddenly inundated by a deluge of unfamiliar and deeply nuanced terminology. However, including these fresh perspectives greatly enriches campus dialogue. After all, discussion of any system of power — including colonialism, white privilege and patriarchy — is inadequate and restricted if limited to one national perspective. Yet many elite universities have avoided or ignored these discussions by using “International” as a race in their official data. In doing so, these institutions — including our own — gloss over significant distinctions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This decision also reveals a view of the international community that is too monolithic. There is no single international experience at university, just as there is no categorically American experience at college. Rather, every student who comes to an institution like Brown carries with them a unique background and situation within the hegemonies of power that undergird our social life. These identities — malleable, contextual and often indeterminate — contribute to that great concept called diversity. Our university, from students through faculty to the highest levels of administration, has repeatedly emphasized the value of this ideal. We must actively evaluate how this is reflected both in our daily conversations and administrative discourse. Imprudent and unreflective use of “International” hinders our ability to achieve this goal by obscuring the diversity — racial, ethnic and otherwise — of this community.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I do not argue that “International” is a label that has no use. After all, many international students have needs specifically tied to their international status — for example, difficulties adjusting to an American academic environment and visa issues. But I believe that the category “International” has no place in racial discourse, whether that is manifested in student dialogue or in administrative decisions in situations such as undergraduate admissions. This use of “International” belittles the valuable diversity of the international student body and brushes aside the experiences of people of color of non-American nationalities. Leaving our assumptions about race and the international experience unexamined defies our common commitment to holding significant discussions about the systems of power that affect us all.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In some way, small or large, everyone wants to see change. But the blessing and the curse of change is that it never happens without concerted effort. Each of us has a choice: to stay or to move. In the wake of an administration full of hate in its many ugly faces, we know we need to move — this much is obvious. For American immigrants abroad, torn from their families for crimes they never committed, we need to move. For LGBTQ citizens, for women, for black Americans, for Muslims, for Jews, for Native Americans, for everyone watching their human rights threatened by a demagogue, we need to move.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Anne Frank once wrote, “How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.” How powerful it is that all of us have a choice whether or not to take the challenging route of action.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How our country fares over the next four years and beyond depends entirely on us — the people — and how much we decide to push for change. In such trying times, I have to ask myself: Will I give that one morning to an important demonstration? Will I hold my representatives accountable? If I don’t — if we all don’t — dive into the project of building a better country from the bottom up, then who will?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Luckily, I can take heart in the knowledge that at Brown and in Providence and Rhode Island, apathy has no place. Over the past several months, a collection of students and I formed a group knowing that there are countless people in our communities willing and able to take action. Through the Brown Progressive Action Committee, we aim to amplify the efforts of the numerous activist groups already doing amazing work and empower those new to the political scene so their voices can be heard. By channeling the energy found on campus after the election results and the horrifying first two weeks of the new presidency, we hope to promote a simple mantra of progress: Making positive change is neither inevitable nor automatic, but that it is above all achievable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though formidable on our own, we are strongest as a group. Whether you are an interested student, a group leader, an activist or an academic, every one of you has an important role to play. But we need a way to translate the need for change to change itself, and this is why an organization like BPAC is so important.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On campus, there are a number of committed groups driving progressive policies. But it is often difficult for such groups to promote themselves and their events in the larger Brown community and to reach as many inspired people as possible. A group like BPAC can provide a centralized hub of opportunities and events through its social media platforms. We need an organization ready to connect student groups with local politicians passionate about the group’s cause, keeping in mind that we are strongest together. With a number of students connected to groups and leaders throughout Rhode Island, we are each other’s best resources.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For me, hoping for better was not enough. Frustrated with the status quo, I was looking for a way to get involved. I was looking, perhaps, for groups on and off campus who could teach me the skills of activism, like lobbying, effective protesting, calling representatives, canvassing and staying informed. And though there were many focused organizations teaching me how to discuss climate change, discrimination and LGBTQ rights, I felt a lack of centrality. Once I learned that there was more to acting than agonizing, it became all the more vital for me to find an organization devoted to fulfilling these roles.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is where BPAC can be an important resource to our campus. Through weekly meetings and frequent events, an organization like BPAC can give Brown students the opportunity to discuss how we are going to push progress in the legislature. Together, we can lobby on behalf of upcoming state bills strengthening women’s health rights, regulating harmful pollutants and more.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At a time when widespread citizen engagement is so necessary, it is important to remember that every single person’s voice and experience are valuable. As dreadful as it is to watch act after act from Washington affect lives across the country and the world, there is some solace in knowing that we can have an impact on our own communities. In order for BPAC to help political activism continue to flourish at Brown, we need to be a vibrant and diverse community with members committed to its success. If we all get in this fight together, we can reclaim progress.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fortunately, we need not wait even a single moment to begin advocating for change. Trump doesn’t deserve our inaction, but our communities deserve our support.</span></p>

		<title>Jacobs &#039;18: The conservative assault on free speech</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/06/jacobs-18-conservative-assault-free-speech/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">My conservative friends tell me that free speech is under assault by American liberals. A brief interaction with on-campus Republican groups or a glance at right-wing social media communities reveals similar sentiments. Conservatives claim that political correctness has gone wild and that attempts to censor speech threaten to hurl the United States into a dystopian and intellectually neutered future.</p>
<p class="p2">But this is nonsense. It is a tale conservatives have retold in an increasingly banal litany that fails to accurately represent the American political climate and distracts from the most pernicious threats to free speech. What may have begun as a helpful — and perhaps needed — criticism of the left has mutated into a sordid and misused slogan, utterly incapable of contributing to political discourse and instead bent on coddling far-right conservatives.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, there have also been instances when progressives have undermined free speech. For example, when Milo Yiannopoulos was not able to speak at the University of California at Berkeley because of various <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/us/milo-yiannopoulos-berkeley/">protest-based disruptions</a>, they arguably did a disservice to public discourse and inadvertently bolstered the very ideas they find so contemptible by bringing more attention to Yiannopoulos’s rhetoric. Berkeley students had every reason to protest Milo, but preventing him from speaking only fed into his repugnant convictions.</p>
<p class="p2">But in recent years, the far-right has extended their criticisms to apply to moral condemnation of any kind. Now, when someone regurgitates a political perspective that is by any reasonable standard racist or ignorant, many conservatives tell us we should not label their perspective with those terms. The irony here should be immediately apparent: In the attempt to cast progressives as hypersensitive, conservatives have adopted positions that have produced hypersensitivity amongst themselves. We have to be wary of politicians and writers of any political affiliation who justify contrarian viewpoints in the name of defending free speech.</p>
<p class="p2">One might argue that the use of words such as racist and sexist — and indeed, the entire thesaurus of other -ist words — can stifle discussion when they are employed as ad hominem insults instead of criticisms. But this type of language is no more antagonistic to free speech than calling someone’s opinion incorrect or stupid. It may be unhelpful in promoting discourse, but it is an entirely legitimate application of free speech. In fact, nuanced moral condemnation is essential to political discourse. Who thinks we should avoid such language when describing neo-Nazis? Criticism on ethical or moral grounds is essential to prevent the normalization of such views.</p>
<p class="p2">We should not pull our punches for the sake of ideological diversity. Not all opinions are good ones — there are no “alternative facts,” history is not a fictional narrative constructed by George Soros and there are very real consequences of espousing xenophobic and decisively immoral positions. The notion that people should not be allowed an impassioned rebuttal when faced with such distressing elements is inherently antagonistic to free speech.</p>
<p class="p2">Though I sympathize with conservatives on campus who may feel dwarfed by the largely liberal student population readily disposed to attack right-wing ideas, a liberal environment does not mean that free speech is under attack. It only indicates that conservatism is an <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/09/16/brown">ideological minority</a> and that if someone wants to defend President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, they better do a damn good job of it.</p>
<p class="p2">Today, with an administration disposed toward authoritarianism, free speech advocates who have traditionally criticized the left should turn their attention to a government and political movement that poses unprecedented threats to civil liberties, including free speech.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The generously-named alt-right have appropriated the term “fake news” and apply it to any piece of information contrary to their own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/25/us/politics/fake-news-claims-conservatives-mainstream-media-.html?_r=0">ideological positions</a>. They’ve <a href="https://www.change.org/p/department-of-justice-arrest-madonna-for-making-threats-against-the-white-house">formulated petitions</a> to arrest Madonna under charges as a terrorist sympathizer. They have contended that criticism of Trump’s policies against refugees is <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/02/01/daily-stormer-targets-federal-judges-ruling-against-trumps-muslim-ban">anti-American and treasonous</a>. And they’ve exhorted followers to <a href="http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/twitter-leslie-jones-milo-yiannopoulos-1201818460/">harass and threaten</a> ideological and cultural opponents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Things are even more worrying at higher levels. The president has attempted to thwart the media — referring to them as <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/donald-trump-steve-bannon-media-opposition-party-234280">“the opposition.”</a> He has threatened to<a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/donald-trump-libel-laws-219866"> “open up”</a> libel laws so he can prosecute journalists and has repeatedly attempted to silence and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/trumps-anti-democratic-war-on-facts-and-free-speech-w462960">discredit his critics</a>. The current administration’s Chief Strategist Steve Bannon has said the media should <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/media/stephen-bannon-trump-news-media.html">“keep its mouth shut”</a> while simultaneously expressing sympathies for authoritarian ideologies. Even if many currently express distrust in the media, one cannot find any parallel to this extreme on the left.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If there was ever a time for free-speech advocates to direct their criticisms and opposition chiefly towardsprogressives, that time has passed. And though I believe that the left should undoubtedly do more to become receptive and open to conservative viewpoints, the notion that the left is engaging in some widespread movement that seeks to limit free speech is a misguided straw man. This argument distracts us from a party and an administration with an affinity for censorship and fundamentally undermines the movement to preserve free speech.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There has been terrifyingly little introspection by the Democratic Party in the months following the election. It has instead preferred to blame anyone but itself for what happened on Nov. 8. James Comey, Russia, Wikileaks, the media, Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein and the rural, working class have been targeted to deflect responsibility and preserve the status quo. But I am not interested in the extent to which the party forsook its progressive base and supported the nomination of a deeply flawed candidate. I am instead concerned about ways the party must transform if it hopes to offer real resistance to the neo-Nazi ideology now in executive and legislative power.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Later this month, the party has an opportunity to redefine itself, to demonstrate its commitment to the marginalized communities that it has long relied on for support yet so often ignored: The party must elect progressive Rep. Keith Ellison, D-MN, to chair the Democratic National Committee. Ellison — the first Muslim elected to Congress — would offer a significant change to the dominant political culture of the party. His candidacy, which has the support of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, would mean a commitment to grassroots organizing and mass mobilization rather than high-dollar fundraisers attended by the political elites and the neoliberal dogma that has long defined the party’s platform.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The tension between these two visions of the Democratic Party was certainly visible in the recent debate among the DNC chair candidates. It is a fundamental characteristic of politicians confronted with uncomfortable truths to direct attention elsewhere — away from themselves, the party, prominent supporters and donors. Nowhere is this more obvious than in conversation about the Israel-Palestine conflict. When discussing the region, American politicians navigate a delicate balance of demonstrating knowledge of the region and its history while avoiding scrutiny of the foremost purveyors of violence: the United States and Israel. On Jan. 18, Ellison and former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez ’83 — the two favorites to win the position — and five others gathered at George Washington University to discuss the ideological state and future of the party. In the moments following the debate’s conclusion, Zaid Jilani, who writes for The Intercept, met Perez and said, “People are quick to condemn the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement, but there have also been really strong actions against human rights by Israel. For example, 1,600 Palestinians lost their homes last year to home <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_cDNaNWnkU">demolitions</a>.” Perez’s countenance quickly became filled with angst and frustration, and he turned to walk away, telling Jilani, “Absolutely, I understand it’s a complicated issue.” Jilani followed him, asking, “Secretary, would you condemn the home demolitions by (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu?” Perez disappeared behind the stage, leaving the question unanswered.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Perez’s profile in courage is not an aberration. It is, in fact, a peculiarity of the Democratic Party to espouse in the same moment profound love and empathy for ordinary people engaged in struggle and a commitment to the interests of oppressive states, bankers and major industries. The evidence of this dichotomy has become rather plentiful in recent decades. Former President Bill Clinton implemented a corporate-friendly trade policy that adversely affected labor and the working <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/12/17/251945882/what-has-nafta-meant-for-workers-that-debates-still-raging">class</a> as well as the destructive <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/09/12/347736999/20-years-later-major-crime-bill-viewed-as-terrible-mistake">Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994</a>. Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s neoconservative foreign policy was illuminated during her time as Secretary of State and again in her failed presidential campaign with her support of coups in <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/13/how-hillary-helped-ruin-haiti.html">Haiti</a> and <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/9/hillary-clinton-honduraslatinamericaforeignpolicy.html">Honduras</a>, campaigns to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html">bomb</a> Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria and <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/democratic-debate-milwaukee-2016/2016/02/hillary-clinton-henry-kissinger-219183">admiration</a> of <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11640562/kissinger-pentagon-award,">accused</a> war criminal <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/11/10/henry_kissingers_genocidal_legacy_partner/">Henry Kissinger</a>. And though former President Barack Obama’s presidency seems to be a distant, blissful memory, the left must remain cognizant of his most disappointing failures as well. These include his refusal to prosecute the financiers <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/untouchables/">responsible for the recession</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>or to hold accountable <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/us/holder-rules-out-prosecutions-in-cia-interrogations.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1">torturers of Muslims</a>; the $38 billion in military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/middleeast/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-military-aid.html?_r=0">aid</a> to an Israeli state that killed 551 Palestinian children in the span of 50 days in <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/gaza-emergency">2014</a>; and his astonishingly immoral and illegal drone program that has <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2016/07/01/questioning-obamas-drone-deaths-data/">killed hundreds of civilians</a>, including 12 at a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/02/19/wedding-became-funeral/us-drone-attack-marriage-procession-yemen">Yemini wedding party</a>. Forgive those of us on the left whose faith in the Democratic elite has become extinct.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The DNC has before it two distinct doctrines with which to define itself: the Obama-Clinton school of thought that retains deep extant sympathies toward various neoliberal policies, or the more progressive school nearer to the convictions espoused by Sanders. The distinction between them is stark, and the party’s choice of how to resist the neo-Nazi sycophants currently leading the right will have, quite literally, life-altering consequences for the myriad populations targeted by them. This country is in a fight for its soul. If we are to ensure its future does not continue to be usurped by unabridged hate, we must resist more milquetoast policies from the liberal Democrats and embrace a progressive future.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This debate over contemporary party ideology is also active in Rhode Island. Gov. Gina Raimondo supports the more centrist-minded Perez, while 22 state legislators and many other municipal elected officials are endorsing Ellison. Their support of Ellison seems to reflect the wishes of most Rhode Islanders, who fervently supported Sanders in the primaries. The dissonance between what most local legislators and Rhode Islanders want and what its senior leadership actually supports is illustrative of the larger national debate in which the party finds itself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Absent the ability to overcome the barriers to a new progressive party, we are fighting to raise the moral standard of the Democratic one. The party should not ignore that. On Feb. 24, it has the opportunity to demonstrate a commitment to the progressive ideology, marginalized voices and oppressed communities that so desperately need and deserve its focus. Ellison’s election would do just that.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I first heard that Brown was introducing Wintersession, I could not wait to enroll. I carefully factored the time difference from my program abroad and skipped a communal dinner to ensure I could be one of the first to register. It seemed like a wonderful chance to return to Brown early, take one of many very appealing courses and hopefully further my progress in my concentration. Unfortunately, due to disorganization within the program and a lack of communication between Wintersession administrators and department faculty, I was forced to forego the opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On its Wintersession <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/special-programs/wintersession/advising-registration">website</a>, Brown promotes the program as not only a venue to take particularly unique or specialized courses, but also to “spread out coursework throughout the year or earn the additional credit.” This is reflected in the courses offered in this inaugural session: While the three “destination” courses certainly offered a unique opportunity that is difficult to take during the normal semester, the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/special-programs/wintersession/courses">six on-campus courses</a> and one online course were hardly differentiable from typical classes. With one course, CLPS 1292: “Introduction to Programming for the Mind, Brain and Behavior,” that was pitched as an “introduction to MATLAB,” it seemed clear that Brown intended for some students to utilize their Wintersession, as many students do during their summer one, to further their degree or fill gaps in their required study.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This (after being denied registration to a destination course) was my plan. I wanted to attend Wintersession not only to return to Brown early, but also to earn a concentration credit, hopefully easing the density of requirements I would need in my final three semesters. But first, I needed to confirm with my concentration advisor that the Wintersession course satisfied a requirement with my concentration. All I needed for this was the syllabus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But after two months and emails — ultimately becoming a daily routine — to many different professors, advisors and administrators, I had yet to receive even a draft of the syllabus. In the meantime, I received my aid award and my account was billed. I even confirmed my early housing with the Office of Residential Life. Yet as the payment deadline approached, I still had no indication whether this course would serve my needs. I was given no information that would help me analyze whether the investment of multiple thousands of dollars and a month of my time would do anything to further my degree. I was told that unless I was willing to take the class for fun alone, I should drop it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While I enjoy the academic inquiry, personal development and general appeal of taking “fun” classes as much as anyone else, I found that these reasons alone did not warrant attending Wintersession. How could I justify spending thousands of dollars to travel across the country on a course taken purely for its own sake? After all, we are all here with one ultimate purpose: to obtain a degree. While I would count myself a proponent of the myriad other benefits of college, it is absurd to pretend that attendance would be worthwhile for these reasons alone. I can understand that many students might want to attend Wintersession for some of these reasons, but it should not be ridiculous to want more concrete benefits.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be clear, I do not fault the professor, nor my advisors nor anyone else that helped me in my attempt to take this course. They were simply doing their job: preparing a course to be finalized before the first day of class. Especially given that many courses were being taught for the first time, it is entirely reasonable for instructors to have created the course near the end of the fall semester.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But students should not be asked to make a huge commitment with limited information on each course. Given that Brown pitched filling requirements as a reason to attend Wintersession, the administration should have taken more care to work with departments to ensure it was feasible. It should be immediately clear that the nature of Wintersession — and the limited course offerings — differed from that of the regular academic year and rendered shopping impossible. Because of this, the structure of Wintersession should have been held to a higher standard than the fall, spring or summer sessions, and students should have been given as much information about available courses as possible. With the amount of discussion and planning that went into Wintersession, it is unfortunate that the implementation fell short.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given the heightened commitment of attending Wintersession (the extra time, money and effort that is put in by students), Brown should have ensured that these courses ran smoothly for all interested students. Since this was the inaugural Wintersession, one would have thought that Brown would have taken the utmost care to ensure everything went off without a hitch. I cannot blame the professors for not going above and beyond to be ahead of schedule, but with only 10 courses to plan, Brown should have required a more defined proposal on a timeline better suited to students’ needs.</span></p>

		<title>Mitra &#039;18: Fox News&#039; obsession with Brown misses the mark</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Jan. 25, Brown had a famous — or rather, infamous — visitor: Jesse Watters, the host of Watters’ World on The O’Reilly Factor. Watters came to Brown, ostensibly to interview students about toxic masculinity. In a short day on campus, he managed to interview bystanders about safe spaces, <a href="http://blogdailyherald.com/2017/01/25/what-if-madonna-said-she-was-going-to-blow-up-the-white-house-what-would-you-do/">push the bounds of journalistic ethics</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and skate down College Hill near the Rhode Island School of Design. But what struck me the most about the three-minute segment was that it was, once again, all about Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The segment seems to be based on a ridiculously offensive opinion piece by Todd Starnes, published last month on the Fox News website, that critiqued the discussion of toxic masculinity in American colleges. Yet Brown was just one of several universities listed as teaching students about toxic masculinity, along with Oregon State University and Duke University. So why zero in on us?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This isn’t the first time Fox has focused on Brown in detail. As Herald columnist Mark Liang ’19 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/01/31/liang-19-dear-jesse-watters/">pointed out</a> earlier this semester (“Dear Jesse Watters,” Jan. 31), Fox has a long history of arriving on campus with film crews to cover everything from <a href="http://blogdailyherald.com/2012/12/04/arboreal-apocalypse-we-hate-you-too-jesse-watters/">debates on free speech to Christmas trees</a>. Watters himself has covered <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/11/15/fox-news-airs-footage-of-sex-power-god/">Sex Power God</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/10/07/editorial-foxs-pandering-journalism-falls-short/">Nudity in the Upspace</a>, spurring controversy on both occasions. The channel has also sensationally <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/09/10/campaign-controversies-university-has-tampons-mens-room-professor-tears-911-posters-anti">reported</a> on free tampons in Brown restrooms and even past Herald <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/15/brown-university-student-wants-rotc-criminals-banned-from-campus.html">opinions columns</a>. Just last year, Fox picked up a Herald article describing student activism and made it viral around the world. Fox certainly reports on other colleges as well, but the sheer volume of its coverage of Brown sets us apart from most other universities.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the guise of reporting on colleges, Fox has fed into the larger narrative about elitist, oblivious Ivy League students sitting atop an Ivory Tower. But this deluge of coverage completely misses the mark. Fox loves to paint Brown as one of a few universities (along with the likes of University of California at Berkeley, Oberlin College and Wesleyan University) that propagate extremely liberal viewpoints at the exclusion of all others. Yet the Brown student body is not alone in protesting controversial speakers, embracing body positivity, supplying sanitary products, using inclusive language and engaging in student activism. There are numerous colleges across the country that do the same — and not all of them are traditionally liberal schools in <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/free-tampons-pads-us-schools-496083">blue states either.</a> Nor is Brown a homogenous entity filled with like-minded drones. It may be a predominantly liberal institution, but the umbrella term “liberal” still encompasses a wide range of ideas and beliefs — not just the sound bytes presented and parodied on Watters’ World.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Like any other aspiring journalist, I take issue with Fox’s techniques and <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/01/05/12_most_despicable_things_fox_news_did_in_2012/">predilection for skirting basic ethics</a>. But to me, a more pernicious problem with its coverage of Brown is the utter lack of context. In its coverage of Brown, Fox viewers don’t receive any sense of larger national debates or the reasoning behind liberal arguments. And, despite Fox’s selective coverage of colleges, conversations about social justice are happening all around the country, not just in liberal strongholds on the coasts. Satirical segments that poke fun at people are all well and good, but Fox’s brand of news and comedy falls short of achieving any sort of productive discourse.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Don’t get me wrong — I’m the first to admit there is a lot to criticize on college campuses and at Brown. But Fox doesn’t engage in intelligent criticism, rather it prefers to use straw men and play to the stereotypes. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And by stereotyping and otherizing colleges like Brown, Fox News has lost sight of reality and managed to lose touch with college-aged students. As numerous analysts have <a href="https://qz.com/738346/fox-newss-biggest-problem-isnt-the-ailes-ouster-its-that-its-average-viewer-is-a-dinosaur/">outlined over the years</a>, Fox’s biggest weakness is its inability to expand to a younger audience, particularly along the coasts. The median age of its primetime viewer is 68; by comparison, the median age of an average CNN <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/27/media/fox-news-gop-problem/">primetime viewer is 59</a>. Younger viewers are more likely to identify as <a href="https://heri.ucla.edu/press-release/TFS%2050-Year-Trends-Press-Release.pdf">liberal or centrist </a>and already view Fox as one of the least trusted news sources in the country. If Fox truly wants to expand its college-aged market, it can’t afford to spin its own alternative version of the truth.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Fox News and its proponents love to claim that we Ivy Leaguers are living in a bubble. Well, judging from their skewed coverage and obsession with Brown, so are they. Maybe I’m setting the bar too high, but I think even Fox can do better.</span></p>

		<title>Okin ’19: Reconsidering the sophomore slump</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Before entering my second year at Brown, upperclassmen warned me about the “sophomore slump.” According to their precautionary tales, this is a period ridden by paradox: You appreciate not being a newbie, but miss when everything was novel; friendships grow deeper, yet seem boringly familiar; classes may become more interesting, but are simultaneously too hard. To some extent, I am sure every member of the class of 2019 has discovered at least a partial truth to the slump.</p>
<p class="p2">In literature, the “midpoint” refers to the moment that differentiates the first act from the second. At this instant, the central character encounters something — be it a tragic disaster, life changing opportunity or unbelievable secret — that promises to transform the rest of the novel. Essentially, it is when we hold our breath, anticipating the story’s biggest change. While it is not the climax, the course of action the protagonist responds with in this moment undeniably sets up that peak of the novel. Interestingly, some critics sometimes refer to the midpoint by another name: “the moment of commitment.”</p>
<p class="p2">During our sophomore year, we are confronted with the questions that will shape the second act of our time at Brown. The other night, I sat with a friend while she rattled off all the decisions she would have to make by the end of the semester: whether to study abroad, what to declare for her concentration, where to live on campus in the next two years. It was then that I recognized the true significance of sophomore year as not only a literal halfway point of our Brown careers, but also as that figurative literary midpoint. Rather than in a declining slump, we find ourselves building momentum to the pivotal instances of action of our college lives.</p>
<p class="p2">In order to reach these moments of commitment, us second-year protagonists must undergo some deep reflection. What do we want from an abroad experience? Why should we concentrate in this field and not that one? Without this internal questioning, we cannot pursue the essential reactions that propel the next half of our stories here. Arguably, these serious considerations of ourselves are equally — if not more — valuable than the actual choices we make based on them. In these reflections, we push ourselves to understand what we love and hate, strive for and are challenged by, can handle on our own and need help undertaking. More than anything, we unearth the passions that could remain our focal points long past our time on College Hill.</p>
<p class="p2">Thus, I want to propose a reconsideration of sophomore year. Instead of a tumble, a collapse, a sinking, what if we shifted the agency of “slump?” Perhaps instead of being pushed down, we are making the active decision to relax and observe our surroundings. We watch the curious freshmen, reminding us of the adjustment period it took to reach where we are now, nearing the middle of our time in college. We watch the upperclassmen, closer than us to entering the real world and thus scrambling just a little bit more to figure out who they want to be. In this way, maybe our “slump” refers more to our snug position in the Brown bubble, fully enveloped and comfortably floating, than anything else.</p>
<p class="p2">As shopping period passes — and with it, the ability to justify not doing our readings — I urge my fellow sophomores to consider the importance of the decisions we make this semester. Moreover, appreciate the answers about ourselves we reach via our necessary internal questioning — these nuggets of self-understanding form the basis of our lives as upperclassmen and afterwards.</p>

		<title>Smith GS: Beyond ‘Pence’s Poodle’</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Columnists for major news organizations, like the New York Times, criticize President Donald Trump formulaically: They combine critique of his latest policy decisions with creative personal attacks — many of which are pointed and often amusing. New York Times columnist Charles Blow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/opinion/no-trump-not-on-our-watch.html?_r=0">called Trump</a> a “compulsively lying bigot,” for example and “a paragon of the clueless.” New Yorker staff writer Steve Coll <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/06/trumps-information-wars">called him</a> “Digital Age Mussolini Lite.” And New York Times’ Gail Collins <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/opinion/pences-presidential-pet.html">chose</a> “Pence’s Poodle.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While entertaining, this approach is not as impactful as it could be. Every day, a fresh crop of insults appears in major newspapers’ opinion sections, blogs and social media. But overexposure makes readers immune to their impact. There’s nothing left to say. Trump’s hair, hands, clothes, words, past, ideas, thoughts and decisions have all been insulted exhaustively. Dozens of insults follow his every tweet. They have lost their purchase.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Columnists rely too much on these insults. While many of their columns provide insightful and valuable arguments, the power of their message is often lost in the personal attacks that these writers can’t help but include. They need to do a better job.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By steering away from their argument and toward repetitive personal commentary, columnists are not exercising the full potential of their substantial influence. A 1995 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/07/opinion/james-reston-of-the-times.html">New York Times article</a> claimed that columnist James Reston had the political influence of three senators. Columnists are in a unique position to illuminate Trump’s character because they can veer from the objective, news-focused stance of reporters. Additionally, they have a chance to engage with an audience open to serious reflection in a way that, for example, Saturday Night Live’s audience is not. SNL and Alec Baldwin have done an exceptional job of making us laugh at Trump, but columnists should do more than just make us laugh. Nor should they just make us angry. Rather, columnists should find creative ways to elicit unexpected emotions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If readers feel angry after reading every column about Trump, they’re not thinking or feeling anything new. They are simply repeating the same pattern. There’s no space for reflection, new ideas or imagination. Four years of reading anger-inducing columns every morning would not just be painful — it would be unproductive. Columnists should instead challenge readers to feel counterintuitive or surprising emotions about Trump — pity, for example. Trump is a kind of tragic character, after all. He is a bastion of a dying generation, making a last-ditch effort to hold on to his puerile beliefs in a world that is poised to leave everything he stands for behind. His brazen displays of political power only belie his weak character. A new and effective angle could draw out this tension by allowing readers to feel angry about Trump’s policies but simultaneously pity his weaknesses. Readers would then be forced to engage with and reflect on Trump in a different way. Many are already moved to action without considering Trump in a new light, but by broadening the ways we consider our president and his flaws, columnists can spur a wider audience to active reflection.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This tactic also has the potential for political disruption. Trump’s aides have said that he does not want his administration to appear weak. SNL has begun to successfully exploit that insecurity, and Trump has responded vehemently. Columnists should follow SNL’s lead, but with a more somber depiction of Trump’s weakness that invokes pity, not laughter. If they successfully incite Trump to respond, he will undermine himself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One might argue that columnists’ should aim to keep readers angry. Anger makes people protest. And anger is justified, given Trump’s egregious decisions in office.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It could be said that it is dangerous to let people forget their anger, even for a day, because it runs the risk of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>permitting complacency. But readers of these columns, including most of the Brown community, already realize that they have reason to be angry. They won’t forget, and they don’t need to be reminded every day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Instead, what they need from columnists is space for reflection. Insults and anger preclude reflection, and it is reflection that allows readers to more critically consider their relationship to Trump, rather than defaulting to anger. Though it is effective for SNL to make us laugh, it is ineffective for columns to only incite anger and in turn obscure the important reflection they have the power to catalyze.</span></p>

		<title>Liang ’19: Scientific advocacy starts with the scientists</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Science is at war. There’s no other way to say it — between the rogue Twitter accounts of NASA and the National Park Service and the planned March for Science on Earth Day, recent political events have incensed scientists across the nation. President Donald Trump’s administration has yet to hire a scientific advisor, and researchers are suddenly crawling out of the woodwork with their social commentary for the first time. All I can say is: about freaking time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Okay, maybe I’m over-exaggerating. But let me provide some context for my disgruntlement: The day after the election, I was eager to discuss its political consequences with my professors. In my history class, we spent a whole hour discussing the implications of the win for public policy, international relations and department funding. In my chemistry class, we only discussed chemistry. I don’t think we even mentioned the election in my research lab.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Now I know what some of you are probably thinking: “Science is science, and it should be that way in the classroom and in the lab,” or “leave the research for the scientists and the thinking for the policy wonks” or even “wait, we have a history department?” But all you skeptics should understand that the political environment will irrevocably affect us scientists too. We are now facing prospective funding cuts in especially politicized fields such as environmental science and health policy, among others.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just as Trump’s presidency has split the political atmosphere into factions, so too is the scientific field divided between people who believe research should continue above the partisan nature of politics and those who now feel the need to publicly dissent. For a lot of scientists and engineers, dissent is an unfamiliar concept. A lot of this is ingrained in our training; we are taught that our results should speak for themselves and that truth and evidence will eventually prevail. The scientific method does not include an addendum for activism or advocacy. We value quality and peer-revision over loudness, and for the most part this strategy has worked.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But along the way, some researchers have forgotten a vital part of their audience: the American public. Scientific papers are regularly released with the most fantastic of discoveries but are often rarely read by people outside the scientific community. Even worse, these discoveries are pulled out of context and misinterpreted, leading to the concept known as “bad science” (I’m looking at you, anti-vaxxers). Our lack of engagement makes us partially to blame for the scientifically inept fiasco that is our current administration. The American public deserves better, both from them and from us.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Scientific literacy in the United States is low; the general public does well enough to recite certain facts, but it struggles to interpret the societal implications of major scientific findings. Part of that can be attributed to scientists ­— they don’t engage with the riff-raff until the riff-raff becomes loud enough to, let’s say, inspire a March for Science. Marches are great only if they can lead to some sort of sustained campaign or change. Scientists need to be more proactive, rather than reactionary, if we are to accomplish real change in the field of scientific policy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Scientists should become better advocates for their research to the general public, and that requires communication skills that sometimes aren’t covered as part of a science curriculum, even at Brown. I would kill to be assigned an essay for one of my science-heavy STEM classes. People argue that climate-change denial and political or philosophical debates should not be mentioned in science textbooks or in the classroom. I disagree — I say give budding researchers the information they need so that they are better equipped to smash arguments apart later. Civic engagement should involve science and those who conduct it, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Myron Ebell, who led the Environmental Protection Agency transition team these last few months, said, “I’m a great believer in science, but I’m not a great believer in politicized science.” My response to Ebell is simply that all science is political. Funding is often controlled by national grants. Public opinion is swayed by and often shapes how science is done. Research does not exist in a vacuum. Science education and literacy is especially politicized; it is the reason textbooks mention James Watson and Francis Crick but not Rosalind Franklin. If we, as researchers, do not advocate for better science education and literacy, we will continue to be uninvited to the table of power in Washington.

		<title>Rowland ’17: Questioning the budget</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/14/rowland-17-questioning-budget/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">The University released its budget for fiscal year 2018 this week, which unsurprisingly includes tuition increases that outpace inflation by almost twice as much. Because Brown is a tuition-dependent school, especially compared to peers with heftier endowments, this is to be expected. Indeed, reasons cited for the 4 percent increase in tuition included efforts to protect the “long-term health” of the University by growing the endowment to ensure more fruitful returns in the future, according to Provost Richard Locke. But the ways in which we decrease our dependence on tuition deserve scrutiny. This is especially salient considering student protests that call on the University to put its money where its mouth is, so to speak. And in this regard, the University Resource Committee <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/provost/sites/provost/files/URC%20FY18%20Report%20Final%20DRAFT%20V16.pdf">report</a> and subsequent communication on the budget can be misleading.</p>
<p class="p3">First, the budgeting report released this week emphasizes the importance of continuing to increase financial aid, especially in order to strengthen the packages offered to middle class students. Given that financial aid for middle class families is a priority among <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/04/financial-aid-awards-increased-for-middle-income-students/">students</a>, it is appropriate and important to channel money in that direction. But, while the University will receive a 6.2 percent increase in revenue from tuition, the financial aid budget will only increase by 1.32 percent. In dollar terms, the aid budget will grow by $1.587 million, while the University receives $20.136 million more in revenue from tuition than it did last year. That math doesn’t add up; someone is paying the difference.</p>
<p class="p3">Of course, there is the question of who will be most affected by the tuition increase — it’s hard to feel bad about asking people who already pay the sticker amount to pay a bit more. Still, while the financial aid budget has grown by 7.3 percent on average over the last eight years, the percentage of students on aid has only increased by two percentage points: from 41 to 43 percent. It’s hard to believe that the 57 percent of the student body paying the full price of tuition is not feeling strained by accelerating financial burdens.</p>
<p class="p3">Relatedly, though the University announced a 4 percent increase in tuition, the report later shows that it is accompanied by a 6 percent increase in room rate and 6.5 percent increase in board rate, effectively increasing the cost of attending Brown by more than 4 percent. By paying our tuition, we become a captive market for room and board, locking ourselves into an upward spiral of increasing costs. That is, at least until we can go off meal plan or move off campus.</p>
<p class="p3">And while Brown has become less dependent on tuition in the long term by paying out $12.7 million less of our endowment to the education and general budget than last fiscal year, the increase in revenue from tuition is almost twice that number. In other words, the extra tuition we’re paying does more than compensate for the endowment-protecting measures the University is emphasizing in this plan. To what ends?</p>
<p class="p3">The counterpoint to this might be that this money is used to make important investments in target areas for Brown, such as in diversity and inclusion initiatives. Given the heated debate around the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, this budget is an important opportunity for students to hold the administration accountable to their financial commitment to the mission laid out in the plan. The report does in fact include new appropriations for DIAP implementation, but these funds can’t account for (and in fact, barely dent) the surplus of tuition revenue.</p>
<p class="p3">As The Herald previously reported, “The University will allocate $1.5 million toward implementing the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan,” including funding A Day on College Hill travel, boosting diversity in faculty hiring and increasing staffing at centers on campus. This is a sizable and respectable investment, and my argument is not that the contribution is underwhelming. Rather, this contribution to the DIAP is framed as a large use of funds that justifies increases in tuition and overall spending, when in reality, these increases occur in much higher denominations than DIAP funding. Without making assumptions about intent, I would point out that, unlike all the other charts in the URC report, the chart for investment in academic excellence and diversity and inclusion lists dollar amounts in denominations of thousands rather than millions.</p>
<p class="p3">I applaud the University on its efforts to depend less on tuition in a quest to achieve longer term self-sufficiency. But, as I’ve learned at Brown, we should never forget to read between the lines. I’ve also learned that Brown students are incredibly invested in thoughtful critiques and analyses of institutions and authority. Here’s a chance to connect those dots.</p>

		<title>Cardoso ’19: ‘Free speech’ isn’t a license to hate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When protesters recently <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/02/01/berkeley_protests_cancel_pro_bigot_milo_yiannopoulos_campus_appearance.html">prevented</a> Milo Yiannopoulos — a Breitbart editor and seasoned provocateur, a la Ann Coulter — from speaking at a scheduled event at the campus of University of California at Berkeley, free speech advocates were stirred into action from across the political spectrum, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-milo-berkeley-20170203-story.html">castigated</a> the cancellation as a dangerous attack on constitutional rights and chided the protesters for what was probably a pyrrhic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/free-speech-milo-yiannopoulos-alt-right-far-right">victory</a>. In preventing him from speaking, the protestors played right into his narrative claiming that the left is opposed to free speech. After all, prohibiting hate speech is basically tantamount to clamping down on free thought, right? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Well, not really. The underlying principle of this argument is that free expression gives us a peaceful and organized forum through which we can test our ideas. Indeed, Oliver Wendell Holmes once analogized free speech to “free trade in ideas” within “the competition of the market.” Many reasonable voices have held that though Yiannopoulos is nakedly <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/us/milo-yiannopoulos-ivory-tower/">racist</a>, it is exactly because there is a right to free expression that his ideas can be shamed and marginalized. Other defenders seem instead to practically relish in the cruelty of making the argument that no matter how putrid or anathema to American values certain speech may be, it is sacrosanct according to the constitution.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet, free speech is not an unqualified right. At least not in the legal sense. The metaphor of “shouting fire in a crowded theater” was used to justify limiting free speech that posed an immediate threat to others by, incidentally, none other than Holmes. In <a href="http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/constitutional-law/constitutional-law-keyed-to-stone/freedom-of-expression/chaplinsky-v-new-hampshire-2/">Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire</a>, the court held that fighting words — speech or writing meant to elicit violence — were not constitutionally protected either. While the court has narrowed the fighting words doctrine in recent years, the principle that free speech can be circumscribed when it violates the rights of others still persists, even if jurists have thus far refused to apply it to hate <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-snyder-v-phelps">speech</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And violate the rights of others hate speech certainly does. Even if the victims of hate speech are procedurally protected equally under the law, they may not experience equality if their dignity can be demeaned with impunity. Many marginalized groups that find themselves on the receiving end of bigoted invective might technically enjoy equal legal protection, but that technical legal equality doesn’t protect them from a diminished sense of dignity and belonging. Indeed, when we begin to prioritize abstract philosophical principles over protecting human dignity, we’re no longer simply letting the “free trade in ideas” sweep away the undesirable ones. We’re rationalizing calls for oppression and violence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Others will say that while morally reprehensible, the grandstanding of fringe elements, like the so-called “alt-right,” is generally innocuous. I physically recoil when I hear this argument. Hate speech doesn’t simply reveal that the speaker holds harmful views, but actually has consequences. Harmful ideas enter the discourse and encourage others to express them, making them prevalent and part of a new normal that readily justifies lashing out at groups that are blamed for the ills in society. For example, in 2015, two Boston men beat a Latino <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/20/politics/donald-trump-immigration-boston-beating/">man</a> with a metal pole and then proceeded to urinate on him. Their justification was that he was “homeless,” “Hispanic” and “an illegal immigrant” and that “Donald Trump was right.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ultimately, free expression and thoughtful dialogue are among the essential tenets of a healthy liberal democracy, and you’ll be hard pressed to find many who challenge that notion in the mainstream or on the fringes. However, it is still necessary that we appreciate the need to balance that invaluable right to free expression with the need to protect human dignity and limit hateful ideas. In the end, while it is easy to reflexively rebuke the protestors at UC Berkeley for violating Yiannopoulos’ right to express himself, we need to ask ourselves if philosophical abstractions are more valuable than a pluralistic and tolerant society that guarantees all of its inhabitants respect for their dignity and safety.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The words “echo chamber” have been thrown around more times than can be tracked during this past presidential election and in ensuing months. Especially on college campuses, where many Americans first become politically conscious, the echo chambers dominating our discourse shouldn’t be dismissed as a fleeting phase — they are a serious threat to the future of our politics. After all, if we teach young minds to mindlessly toe the party line in hopes that any inconsistencies between party platform and personal perspective will just disappear, we’ll create a generation of mindless and inconsistent leaders.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We, as university students, stand to lose the most if we continue to ignore the echo chambers that we ourselves engage in. Even at universities like Brown that pride themselves on diverse student bodies, diversity of thought isn’t always encouraged. I’ve witnessed it myself: As politics becomes increasingly personal, voicing a doubt or concern regarding the dominant political party on campus is a risk that not everyone is willing to take. In an “all-or-nothing” game, few admit to being undecided or, dare I say it, non-aligned. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet, for all the inter-party hostility, intra-party dissent has never been more taboo. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Voters on both sides of the aisle would agree that politics has increasingly become consumed by an “us” versus “them” mentality. But while we spend most of our time separating ourselves from “them,” we choose not to examine the “us.” I really do wonder if we’re as united as party slogans claim we are. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In today’s political climate, you pick a party loyalty and stick with it blindly, even when you can’t fully defend your party’s choices on some policy matters. Showing doubt or opposition toward your party’s platform is essentially considered a sign of weakness. None of us seem willing to admit that politics isn’t about absolute truth, and that few of us fit perfectly within a pure political camp. It doesn’t take much digging below the surface of party politics, though, to hit intra-party disagreement and confusion. So why can’t we be upfront about the fact that our parties aren’t perfect embodiments of our beliefs, and that we don’t always know exactly which mold we fit in?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to the American Psychological Association, voters don’t think in exclusively ideological terms, no matter what the rhetoric of political elites might suggest. We may brand ourselves according to specific party ideologies, but the truth is we tackle political problems issue by issue, struggling to map our instincts on a spectrum.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This year, the Democratic National Committee’s chairmanship election captures the internal struggle happening within the party. The frontrunners — Rep. Keith Ellison, D-MN, and Thomas Perez ’83, who backed Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, respectively — represent significantly different visions for the future of Democratic politics. The race has all the drama and disagreement over political agendas of the presidential election, though it doesn’t make as many headlines or Facebook feeds. In the meantime, some Republicans have grown increasingly critical of President Trump. “(The administration) is dysfunctional as far as national security is concerned,” Sen. John McCain, R-AZ, said after the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who lied about a telephone conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s clear to anyone watching what’s happening in Washington that the dominant political parties are anything but unified and that supporters on both sides of the aisle are more than a little conflicted. But, despite the importance of scrutinizing figures of authority regardless of political party, we’ve all picked up a dangerous habit: picking the party we consider the lesser evil and committing to its defense even when we disagree with it ourselves. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The path to admitting the non-absolute nature of politics must start on college campuses, where young adults from different backgrounds are forming their political opinions and, by extension, the future of politics. Universities are not the empowering institutions they claim to be if they don’t actively foster productive conversation among diverse young adults. College students are more politically active than they’ve ever been, participating in elections and protests across the country. A 2016 poll from the Higher Education Research Institute found that college freshman were more likely to participate in campus activism, believe in the importance of community leadership and foster multicultural understanding. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indeed, if we get into the habit of suppressing or policing intra-party dissent out of fear of seeming weak to the other side, we’re sending a dangerous message: It’s better to block out the realities you don’t agree with than to speak up. If we let this habit become an entrenched part of our political lives, we run the risk of producing young minds who are resentful of politics, distrustful of politicians and unlikely to contribute to national conversations. Self-analysis isn’t a sign of party weakness but rather the budding start of party progress. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">College students are the future of the political process, and that process begins at universities all over the country. In college and beyond, it’s the responsibility of young people to step up and say, “I don’t agree with certain political moves, even if it’s my team moving the pieces.” When was the last time any one of us made that admission or spoke to someone who challenged us to? </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">In anticipation of the Oscars this weekend, we can look back at a film and music awards season that was one of the most politicized in recent memory — one that showcased many celebrities using their media platforms to criticize President Trump and his administration. This isn’t just true of the awards circuit itself: As Herald arts and culture critic <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/15/trump-administration-odds-national-film-culture/">Daniel Wayland ’18.5 pointed out</a> in his critique about filmmakers’ responses to the Trump presidency (“Trump administration at odds with national film culture,” Feb. 15), both artists’ platforms and creations can be political protests. Art has historically fostered resistance, and in today’s political climate, it can once again spur social change.</p>
<p class="p3">As audience members, we can sometimes consume art thoughtlessly for the sake of escapism. This is understandable: In these contentious times, it can be comforting to turn toward art that transcends daily struggles and experiences. Attending the ballet or the symphony just to find refuge from the daily barrage of alarming New York Times updates is justified. But art of all forms has more power than just aesthetic pleasure. Art can be dissonant and provoking. As a form of creative expression that leans toward the new and original, art can be inherently progressive. It can inspire action and thus serve as a political tool. Yet Trump’s policies suggest that his administration will not be friendly to the art world, especially art that is recognizably political.</p>
<p class="p3">Trump is so removed from the cultural sphere that he does not have a clear position on the arts and its funding, and there is no question that his plans to improve the country have nothing to do with the arts. Trump wants to cut federal spending, and the National Endowment for the Arts is <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/02/11/514650953/as-trump-mulls-funding-cuts-for-the-arts-an-artist-argues-against-the-nea">rumored</a> to be on the list of potential budget cuts. And with all of Trump’s mildly authoritarian tendencies and predilection for <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-01-17/what-does-donald-trumps-election-mean-for-digital-freedom-of-speech">manipulating libel laws</a>, Trump poses a concern to those who voice dissent through their art.</p>
<p class="p3">Yet artists are already using their platforms to make political statements and dissents. At the Grammy Awards, A Tribe Called Quest’s performance <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/02/13/a_tribe_called_quest_showed_the_grammys_how_political_statements_are_done.html">directly addressed</a> Trump and his immigration ban, and at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, a countless number of celebrities <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/01/29/sag-awards-get-political-early-as-julia-louis-dreyfus-ashton-kutcher-slam-trumps-executive-order/?utm_term=.4889b70891ec">denounced the ban</a>, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Mahershala Ali and Taraji P. Henson. Likewise, on inauguration day this year, the #J20 Art Strike organized museums and gallery closures, while other museums <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/06/how-can-the-art-world-resist-trump-probably-not-very-well/?utm_term=.54fa6781cebb">offered free admission</a> to those who wished to escape from news about the inauguration. This was reminiscent of another protest under similar circumstances, when the art world withheld access and even closed museums for a day in 1969 to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/design/christo-protest-donald-trump-colorado-artwork.html">protest the Vietnam War</a>. These are promising signs that artists will not take Trump’s posturing lying down, and to be most effective, artists should continue to create political art prolifically. And as consumers of art, we should not shy away from political pieces; we should support artists’ right to criticize the administration through their work and use art to broaden our own perspectives.</p>
<p class="p3">We should remember that everyone — not just the artists — plays<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a role in consuming and leveraging politicized art. Art and its audience can engage in conversation. Take Igor Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring:” The piece broke convention in itself, but the riot at its premiere in 1913 placed it in the history books. As the public, we need to contextualize art and understand that, by consuming art, we are entering a larger dialogue that has far-reaching implications.</p>
<p class="p3">To support artists in this tense climate, we don’t have to look beyond the borders of Rhode Island. Rhode Island is home to several art organizations that reaffirm and uphold diversity and inclusivity. For example, we can embrace organizations such as <a href="https://as220.org/about/">AS220</a> and the Rhode Island Writers Colony who are making the arts more accessible. Our state also hosts arts organizations dedicated to preserving cultural tradition, such as the Center for the Arts and Culture of the Americas, Algonquin Indian Arts and Culture Association and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Latin.American.Film.Festival/">Providence Latin American Film Festival</a>. We can read Rhode Island writers of color like <a href="http://frannychoi.com">Franny Choi</a> and <a href="https://padmavenkatraman.com">Padma Venkatraman</a>, and we can support art <a href="http://ripr.org/post/ric-artist-residence-reaches-refugees-through-art">created by Rhode Island refugees</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">Now, more than ever, we must think about art’s role in our contemporary political climate. Though Trump’s executive orders and authoritarianism are extremely troubling, his lack of regard for freedom of expression through art is also concerning. Freedom of expression and creativity are essential to expressing resistance to Trump and his harmful policies. It is imperative to create and support art that resists the growing hate within our nation and has the power to unite rather than divide.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every president, without fail, faces criticism for wasteful use of taxpayer money on extravagant vacations and excursions. President Trump is no exception. His weekend routine of traveling to his Mar-a-Lago estate — which he has <a href="http://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2017/01/trump-dubs-mar-a-lago-the-new-winter-white-house-108841]">coined</a> the “Winter White House” — has many opponents<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>petulantly complaining about Trump’s frivolous spending. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just a month into the Trump presidency, multiple publications have sensationally covered the sheer cost of Trump’s travel. <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a8946052/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-trips-10-million-taxpayers/">Headlines</a> like “Trump’s 3 Trips to Mar-a-Lago Cost $10 Million and Your Taxes Are Paying For It” and “President Trump’s trips to Mar-a-Lago have cost taxpayers an estimated $10 million” show the cost-oriented <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/21/14683940/trump-travel-cost-mar-a-lago">focus</a> of the media. But the Mar-a-Lago hotel has not been the only excessive cost that has consumed media outlets and politicians. The New York Times published a story in December titled, “New York Asks U.S. to Pay Trump Security Costs; Puts First Bill at $35 Million,” in regards to the security Trump’s family requires at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/nyregion/new-york-reimburse-trump-security-costs.html">Trump Tower</a>. These headlines divert attention away from more important issues with Trump’s spending and instead emphasize the cost to taxpayers, which is nothing new.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is important to note this issue is not isolated to Trump; criticism of extravagant spending has been a tool of political opponents to attack previous administrations. Many outlets were outraged when it was revealed that $3.6 million was spent when former President Barack Obama went on a weekend golfing <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/26/obama-golf-weekend-tiger-woods-2013-more-36m/">getaway with Tiger Woods</a>. In response, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell “<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/17/seizing-good-week-obama-takes-vacation-despite-gop-criticisms.html">accused</a> the president of being out of touch.” Even Trump criticized Obama, <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/125990387226652672">tweeting</a> “Why is @BarackObama always campaigning or on vacation?” During his eight years in office, Obama’s travel expenses totaled about $97 million; this is no small fee, but it is still similar to former President George W. Bush’s travel costs. Throughout his time as president, Bush took 879 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-presidential-vacations/2014/08/15/2aa969c6-2311-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html">days of vacation</a> to his ranch in Texas, and his cabinet members and Secret Service personnel’s salaries were arguably going toward a president who was not working. Both former presidents spent a sizable amount of money on personal travel, proving this spending is not exclusive to a single party. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even if other presidents weren’t as wasteful as Trump, these sums are inconsequential compared to the president’s larger travel budget. On personal vacations, presidents are responsible for their own <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-presidential-vacations/2014/08/15/2aa969c6-2311-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html">food and lodging</a> while taxpayers foot the bill for all costs related to security and staff travel. These auxiliary expenses are not incurred solely during vacations, but also during diplomatic and domestic travel. The president’s use of Air Force One costs taxpayers about $200,000 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/05/air-force-one-is-a-heck-of-an-expensive-perk-for-taxpayers/">an hour regardless</a> of whether the plane is being used for vacations or official travel. In the grand scheme of typical White House expenses — for example, taxpayers had to pay $1.4 billion per year to run Obama’s White House — vacation costs <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/news/guess-how-much-it-cost-taxpayers-protect-first-family/">seem truly insignificant</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While it is politically opportunistic to dwell on Trump’s travel expenses, the bipartisan hypocrisy involved in and the relatively minor size of the issue are why journalists should be less concerned about the cost of presidents’ personal travel.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Criticisms about relatively insignificant spending steal headlines while far more abhorrent actions by the Trump administration go underexamined. It is time to stop focusing on Trump’s monetary waste and instead focus on the conflicts of interest and security concerns that go along with Trump’s travel. When North Korea conducted a missile test Feb. 12, Trump responded in the presence of members of the Mar-a-Lago resort who had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/mar-a-lago-north-korea-trump.html">no security clearance</a>. Members of the resort also took photos with the soldier who accompanies the president with the computer that controls nuclear missiles. These photos ended up on Facebook and other social media platforms, displaying Mar-a-Lago members’ unfettered access to the president and the Japanese prime minister during their visit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What’s more worrisome is the fact that Trump seems to be getting rich off of his new title at the expense of taxpayer dollars. Since becoming president, Trump has doubled his membership fee for Mar-a-Lago, and this was undoubtedly tied to the access to the president <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/25/mar-a-lago-membership-fee-doubles-to-200000.html">one gains as a member</a>. To incentivize membership, Trump has showed up at members’ <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/02/13/trump-crashes-nashville-socialites-wedding-mar--lago/97871278/">weddings</a> during his visits to the resort. There have also been talks about the Secret Service leasing an entire floor in Trump Tower, which would mean $1.5 million of taxpayer money being directly transferred into Trump’s corporate <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/politics/secret-service-trump-tower/">bank account</a>. Most recently, it cost taxpayers $100,000 to provide security for Eric Trump on a “Trump Organization promotional trip” to Uruguay. The idea that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/eric-trumps-trip-to-uruguay-cost-taxpayers-97830-in-hotel-bills/2017/02/03/ababd64e-e95c-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html">the government is paying</a> to help the president make larger profits is deeply disturbing. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yes, Trump’s spending is absurd. But it is not how much he is spending but what he is doing with the money that is truly concerning. In the past few weeks, flashy, less substantive topics that steal headlines have received lots of attention, while more concerning news has gone overlooked. With this recent overabundance of outrageous news, it is increasingly clear that the burden lies on readers to sift through and acknowledge what is truly corrupt. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As far as American politics go, the events of the past few weeks have felt more like the deranged musings of a candy man writing an avant-garde space opera than reality. In a press conference with Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/opinion/inching-toward-a-one-state-solution.html">claimed</a> that he could “live with” a one-state solution, dismissing the need to strike a good-faith compromise with the Palestinians. Days earlier, Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser, resigned after it was revealed that he misled the administration about a telephone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/congress-nsc-flynn.html">conversation</a> he had in December with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Soon after, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis essentially threatened to cut American funding for NATO, which protects most of the Western world, if other member states <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/world/europe/jim-mattis-nato-trump.html">fail to boost</a> their own military spending. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of all the things the Trump administration desperately needs to be fluent in, foreign policy may be the most important. Not since the Cold War has the United States encountered so many concurrent perils. In this climate of global commotion, the administration’s reversal of well-established American foreign policy — belief in a fair peace between Israel and Palestine, suspicion of autocrats like Russian President Vladimir Putin and unflinching support for close partners — is dangerously discombobulating. And with Flynn’s departure and Trump’s promotion of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-national-security-council.html">white-supremacist-in-residence</a> Steve Bannon — who has no official experience in security affairs — to the National Security Council, American foreign policy is on the verge of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-trump-foreign-incoherence-20170221-story.html">strategic bankruptcy</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Under more typical circumstances, Congress would be aggressively pursuing corrective action. Unfortunately for the party of former President </span>Theodore Roosevelt, the GOP may speak loudly about putting “America first,” but carries a stick much too diminutive to enforce ethical behavior and act in the nation’s interest. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-UT, who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and is responsible for investigating official impropriety, appeared unfazed by Flynn’s departure. <a href="http://www.salon.com/2017/02/14/house-republicans-show-little-interest-in-investigating-the-michael-flynn-scandal/">He told reporters</a> that the situation “is taking care of itself at this point.” Rep. Chris Collins, R-NY, echoed the importance of moving on from the Flynn scandal, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/politics/cnn-anchor-zero-chance-journalists-move-on-cnntv">telling CNN’s Chris Cuomo</a>, “Guess what? (Flynn’s) resigned. Now what? We have a lot of issues to deal with. That’s how I live my life. I don’t dwell in the past.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a government that lacks the moral machinery to restrain immoral behavior, it will take individual resistance — perhaps even insubordination — to ensure that the Trump administration does not condemn the country to global irrelevance. Indeed, in diplomacy, one should never underestimate the power of one well-positioned bureaucrat with the will to achieve. Throughout the twentieth century, it has often been individual personalities of the highest moral character and ambition, in the highest echelons of the federal government, who have resolved ancient antipathies, restored relations and enabled peace. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Richard Holbrooke ’62, former Herald editor, the youngest assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and legendary American diplomat, is a prime example. Holbrooke served in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/28/the-last-mission">every Democratic administration</a> since John F. Kennedy’s, negotiated in 1995 an end to the conflict in Bosnia, which saw the deaths of over 100,000 people, and was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize by Elie Wiesel. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I cannot completely list all of Holbrooke’s achievements, and, like all policymakers, he had his fair share of flaws. But it doesn’t take an advanced degree in political science to see what a masterful diplomat he truly was. Endowed with the ability to seduce, cajole and intimidate all in a single meeting, Holbrooke had an eye for the sprawling narratives that undergird the endless machinations of the world. And, most importantly, he never let political calculations overwhelm his commitment to his fellow man. As one Dutch ambassador noted, he was “willing to use the word ‘evil’ when it’s appropriate.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For all his courage and diplomatic dexterity, though, Holbrooke couldn’t quite fulfill his most profound ambition: to become the secretary of state. He was on the shortlists of several presidents and presidential hopefuls, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore and John Kerry. Thankfully the plateau of his career did not stop him from indulging his ravenous intellect with new crusades and causes. He spent his last days in 2010 as a special representative in the State Department, flying monthly to Afghanistan and Pakistan, frenetically trying to sustain the prospect of stability and peace in the embattled region. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Holbrooke is the kind of leader America needs today — a public servant with an unflagging moral compass, a knack for finding sense and meaning in the chaos and, above all, loyalty to his ultimate employer: the American people. While this republic will never have another Holbrooke, Trump’s recently-appointed national security adviser, Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster, can be a much-needed reincarnation of Holbrooke’s experience and integrity. A hardened soldier and a consummate scholar, McMaster is known for his battlefield heroics during the Gulf War and for his 1997 book “Dereliction of Duty,” in which he called American military commanders’ inability to resist intervention in Vietnam “<a href="http://theweek.com/articles/681369/hr-mcmaster-stand-president-trump">a uniquely human failure</a>.” Hopefully, McMaster will stay true to his brilliant record and contain the Trump White House’s ever-brimming cauldron of strategic lunacy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the meantime, as we all wait for the next episode of Trump’s America, we can find some solace in Holbrooke’s enduring optimism about the future of America. In 2009, a little over a year before his death, Holbrooke told the New Yorker, “I still believe in the possibility of the United States, with all its will and all its strength, and I don’t just mean military, persevering against any challenge. I still believe in that.” Holbrooke’s legacies are innumerable, but hope — for a smarter America and safer world — may be his most essential. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">When we think about professional athletes, we think about fame, glamour and multi-million-dollar salaries. Baseball may be the richest sport of them all, as 28 of the 30 largest sports <a href="weblink: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_sports_contracts">contracts of all time belong to baseball players</a>, but this perception ignores the players who never make it big. These are most common in baseball as well, given its extensive minor league system which pays players less than minimum wage. Even in the major leagues, a player’s team can cut him without owing another cent at the end of any of his first six seasons, providing little security for players at the beginning of their careers. This system of annually escalating salaries has led to riches for many, but has left those who do not play well enough or get hurt without anything to fall back on.</p>
<p class="p3">But there is another option for young players: signing an extension that guarantees a salary for those six years, even if it means making less than the player can expect if he succeeds. Staying on one-year contracts might increase the amount a player makes on average,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but missing out on an even bigger payday by signing an extension is a much smaller concern than potentially not getting paid at all if a player falls short of expectations and is cut immediately.</p>
<p class="p3">For each of a player’s first three seasons in the major leagues, he makes roughly the minimum salary, which is about $500,000. After that, he enters arbitration, where his pay is determined by what comparable players earned at that stage in the past. He is under arbitration for an additional three years before reaching free agency after his sixth season. But under this system, a player is at the complete mercy of his team, which can choose not to offer him a contract after any of those six seasons and leave him without any guaranteed money. Extensions usually cover these six years plus at least one team option, where the team can choose to pay the player a certain amount for another year or allow him to become a free agent.</p>
<p class="p3">The perfect example of how extensions can make a huge difference for a player is Houston Astros first baseman Jon Singleton. Before reaching the major leagues in 2014, Singleton signed an eight-year contract extension that guaranteed him $10 million total. The first five years were fully guaranteed, followed by three team options that, if all exercised, would pay him an additional $20.5 million. Because he did not play a full major league season in 2014, the contract covered all six of his original team-controlled years and one free-agent season. The final team option was worth $13 million, so Singleton was only going to make about $17 million for his team-controlled years even if he was successful.</p>
<p class="p3">This would have been a serious discount if Singleton, then one of the top prospects in baseball, had lived up to his potential. By way of comparison, good-but-not-great first baseman Eric Hosmer will have made $31 million for his six team-controlled years when he becomes a free agent after the 2017 season and will likely sign a free agent deal that pays him more than $13 million annually for 2018 and for a few years after that.</p>
<p class="p3">But Singleton fell far short of his potential. Through two major league seasons, he had an abysmal .171 batting average and was removed from the Astros’ major league roster. Had he not signed an extension, he would likely have earned under $1 million for his two partial major league seasons and washed out of the game forever. The difference between $1 million and $10 million is massive — much greater than the difference between $10 million and $30 million when it comes to quality of life.</p>
<p class="p3">This guarantee means even more when you realize how little else these players have. Singleton was drafted out of high school, heavily limiting his job opportunities for after his playing career ends. Some players receive huge draft bonuses — the 2016 first overall pick, Mickey Moniak, received $6.1 million — and have little need for the financial security of an extension. But Singleton was an eighth-round pick and was paid a $200,000 bonus, which seems like a good amount until you realize he had to stretch that out over his five minor league seasons. With players earning under $10,000 annually in the minors, he had little else to supplement his bonus. The difference between entering a life after baseball with $1 million in the bank versus $10 million is gargantuan.</p>
<p class="p3">In the interest of full disclosure, Singleton is the only notable example of a player becoming an absolute bust after signing an extension. But he is also one of very few players to sign his extension before reaching the major leagues. Most examples of extensions that hugely limited a player’s future earnings were given to players with at least one MLB season under their belt, during which they proved themselves to be deserving of a long-term investment. And there are quite a few who have really gotten screwed: Chris Sale, Adam Eaton, Evan Longoria, José Altuve and Anthony Rizzo, to name a few. Extensions make sense for minor leaguers who have never had the chance to succeed or fail in the majors, not proven MLB players.</p>
<p class="p3">For players who have spent years toiling in the minor leagues for a pittance, an extension represents a golden opportunity to lock down a long-awaited payday. But these deals are very rare, as players hold out in hopes of making even more money down the road. For men with little savings and limited career prospects outside of baseball, the security of an extension is far better than taking a gamble for even more money.</p>

		<title>Klein &#039;20: Lebron James, MVP</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Terrific individual performances have been a staple of the current NBA season, as Russell Westbrook and James Harden have compiled monster numbers thus far. Westbrook is on a path to averaging a triple-double for the season and would be the first player to do so since Oscar Robertson in the 1961-1962 season. Meanwhile, Harden could lead the league in points and assists per game — he currently sits at third in points and first in assists in the NBA — a feat not accomplished since Nate Archibald’s 1972-1973 season. The pair has totaled 40 triple-doubles, 26 of those by Westbrook, while Harden enjoyed the finest statistical performance of the season with 53 points, 16 rebounds and 17 assists.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Accordingly, this year’s MVP discussion has centered on Westbrook and Harden. It makes sense. There has even been some mention of the Warriors’ Kevin Durant, who is among the NBA’s best in points per game and shooting percentage and also plays for the league’s best team.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the game’s greatest player, Lebron James, has been forgotten in all the MVP talk. James’ basic statistical averages, while unbelievable, simply don’t jump off the page like Westbrook’s or Harden’s, and his MVP candidacy has suffered in turn.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is important to acknowledge that even in the context of the Harden and Westbrook’s historic seasons, James is putting forth his own entry into the record books. His 8.8 assists per game are the most ever by a non-guard. But there is more to basketball than just the basic statistics, and when one examines James’ case more closely, the choice for MVP becomes far more clear.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">James has a storied NBA career, and last year he led the Cavaliers to the NBA Championship, upsetting the Warriors after trailing three games to one, the greatest comeback in NBA history. This year, the Cavaliers are again one of the NBA’s few contenders. That is, when James is on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Over the past two and a half seasons, the Cavaliers have gone 4-18 when James has not played. Not only are they not contenders — as one would expect with the loss of James — but they are simply dreadful. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those who find advanced statistics more convincing, as is common in the current analytics-driven NBA, the numbers bear this phenomenon out as well. With James on the court, the Cavaliers have a 7.8 point advantage over their opponents per 100 possessions. With Lebron on the bench, Cleveland is outscored by 4.4 points per 100 possessions. That is a 12.2 point difference.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is a different story with Kyrie Irving, the star of last year’s Cavalier playoff run. Even those who criticize James’ MVP campaign because of his star teammate should note only a 4.9 point difference per 100 possessions for Irving. It just goes to show how dominant James truly is, even when compared to one of the NBA’s stars.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As impressive as Harden’s season has been, the difference between the Rockets with Harden on and off the court — 3.5 points per 100 possessions — does not come close to James’ numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Westbrook is the one man who has Lebron beat in this statistic, with a 13.6 point difference per 100 possessions. Much of that is due to how terrible the Thunder bench has been, as opponents outscore Oklahoma City by an astonishing 10.9 points per 100 possessions with Westbrook off the court.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Much has been made of Westbrook’s efforts to carry the Thunder into the playoffs, and he has done incredibly well, dragging a lackluster team into the seventh place in the Western Conference. But for all Westbrook has accomplished, the Thunder are still expected to be quickly dispatched in its first round series.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Harden has taken a Rockets team, albeit one far more talented than Oklahoma City, all the way to the third seed. But the Rockets are far from a guarantee to make the Finals, still behind the timeless Spurs and the Warriors in the Western Conference standings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Only James has the talent to take a bad team to the Finals, as he did in 2007. The Cavaliers are in control of the Eastern Conference, sitting pretty in first place and remaining the prohibitive favorites to reach the NBA’s championship yet again. This year’s trip would be Lebron’s seventh consecutive appearance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before we get too caught up in Westbrook and Harden’s successes, let’s keep in mind who the real MVP is: Lebron James.</span></p>

		<title>Kumar &#039;17: Where are all the feminist men?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Last Thursday, I attended an event hosted by NARAL Pro-Choice Brown University titled “State of the Uterus Address: The Future of Roe v. Wade.” The three-person panel — which included a Planned Parenthood representative, an OB/GYN and a medical student — discussed the dim prospects of women’s health care, reproductive justice and the Supreme Court in the current political climate. With an audience filling Salomon 003, the event proved by its mere existence the importance of reproductive rights to the Brown community. Notably, though, little more than a handful of men were in attendance.</p>
<p class="p3">This dearth of men in the feminist arena, even at Brown, is not unusual. I have witnessed it during the election, when many men were reluctant to declare that they were “with her;” on Facebook, where I often feel isolated among men in posting about women’s right to choose, the struggles trans women of color face or the importance of gender parity in politics and at other events relating to women’s rights. The silence of other men on these issues is often deafening. Yet I know that many men who are not vocally feminist would still describe themselves as such. At a university as left-leaning as Brown, the most important challenge is not to convince men of the importance of gender equality but to convert their beliefs into action.</p>
<p class="p3">One possible reason for men’s relative lack of involvement in fighting for women’s rights is apathy: Because cisgender men will never personally need an abortion, they do not shape their politics around Planned Parenthood funding. Perhaps men without a uterus saw the title of the Brown NARAL event and thought that it didn’t concern them. A more likely explanation, I think, is insecurity about their position as allies. If the goal of feminism is to make space for women, how much space should men take up? If feminism aims to amplify women’s voices, how loudly should men yell in agreement? How can men use their own political power to fight for gender equality without diminishing women’s power?</p>
<p class="p3">There are no simple answers to these questions, and this column can barely scratch the surface of such a debate. One thing is clear, though: Feminism needs more, not fewer, men. By showing up to events and publicly expressing their support for women’s rights, men can demonstrate to other men — including their elected representatives — that everyone can benefit from gender equality, regardless of gender. Men should lean into the discomfort they may feel over their role as allies, keeping in mind that listening and asking questions are better than doing nothing at all.</p>
<p class="p3">Despite the gloomy outlook described by the Brown NARAL panel, there are signs that feminism is becoming steadily ingrained into the American psyche, for women and men alike. In January, many men participated in the Women’s March on Washington and associated marches across the country. At the march in Charlotte, North Carolina, I was delighted to see men displaying their solidarity with their families and friends. Furthermore, prominent governors like Andrew Cuomo of New York and Terry McAuliffe of Virginia have taken a hard stance on protecting access to contraception and reproductive healthcare. These are just two examples among the multitude of ways men can use their influence to turn their appreciation for feminism into concrete action.</p>
<p class="p3">Another good place to look for inspiration is the “He for She” campaign, for which Emma Watson ’14 advocates in her role as Global Goodwill Ambassador of U.N. Women. Though much of the campaign’s value is symbolic, it makes clear that advancing the cause of gender equality is a burden that men must share with women. The steady accumulation of actions as small as challenging jokes that perpetuate gender stereotypes can eventually shape a culture in which gender equality is the norm.</p>
<p class="p3">The panelists at the State of the Uterus Address emphasized the importance of having difficult conversations about abortion, in particular between pro-choice and pro-life advocates. Even if neither person intends to change their mind, some sliver of common ground can nearly always be found. The alternative, in which both sides stay in their own corner and attend events where everyone is already on the same page, will not lead to meaningful progress. Indeed, it seems that the same logic applies to the role of men in feminist politics. Only by announcing loud and clear their support for gender equality and then participating in the occasionally uncomfortable conversations that ensue can feminist men add to the momentum women activists have worked tirelessly to create.</p>

		<title>Okin ’19: Achieving happiness</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I wouldn’t be surprised if many 2021 Brown acceptees ultimately decide to make College Hill their home due to our distinguished <a href="http://college.usatoday.com/2014/03/05/should-you-choose-a-college-based-on-happiness-rankings/">reputation</a> for happiness. Whether it’s the prominent pass-fail system or the welcoming New England campus — with an even more welcoming student body — there are many factors that come to mind when considering our utopian status. But it is no secret that while Brunonia contains the happy, it is also home of the sad, the struggling and the skeptical — and I am not just referring to differences among us all. At different points in a Brown career, a single student can experience all four of these personas. Like any other university, unhappiness plagues our campus for infinite reasons, many individualized and personal. Yet instead of examining the extent of truth behind our ranking on the collegiate barometer of joy, I wish to specifically discuss how we conceptualize our pursuit for happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There exists a misconception that every checkbox we mark off on our goal sheet is simultaneously another point in our life happiness log. But we need to differentiate accomplishing goals from being content in the future. In fact, I would go as far to say that no matter the size of your<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>aspirations<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— whether it’s running a business or running a mile — they all hold an equal promise of happiness: none at all. Too much of the time, we associate things like landing the perfect internship with everything in our lives coming together, making us content. But who’s to say scoring a coveted post-graduation position promises anything more than a coveted post-graduation position? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though I haven’t interacted with a science textbook since high school, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>remains as clear in my mind as any of my recent college readings. I won’t pretend to understand physics in any complex way and thus will keep my explanation simple: The idea is that we cannot know both the position and the speed of a particle at the same time. Essentially, the more accurately we understand one of these values, the less we understand about the other. By observing the atom, we alter it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Similarly, it seems that through trying to quantify our targeted happiness by the number of goals we reach, we are subjecting the concept itself to a similar constant observation. Just as our perception of the atom changes in our efforts to pinpoint its location, our idea of happiness alters in our attempts to identify where it lies among our goal sheet checkboxes. Conflating contentment with specific achievements — getting the A, losing weight, taking that dream vacation — can leave us unsatisfied. With the pressure of the next empty boxes, we are unable to appreciate past accomplishments and enjoy lasting happiness. More often than not, we find ourselves disappointed, as the anticipation of perfect bliss has left us with unmet expectations. The concept of “being happy” is an abstract notion, so it seems arbitrary to associate contentment with such concrete milestones. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Perhaps instead of being defined by specific, significant accomplishments, happiness lurks in the mundane. By shifting energy from chasing goals to instead addressing the smaller, negative occurences in our routines, we can create an inviting ground for contentment to enter our lives. Consider confronting the daily decisions that you can actually locate: mindless social media scrolling that evokes feelings of FOMO, letting others’ voices overwhelm your own, choosing an hour of studying over an hour of needed self-care. We dismiss these negative elements because they don’t necessarily impede our ability to achieve larger goals and therefore have long gone neglected. But these smaller headaches build up and may be the essential detriments to our contentment. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Quit associating undefinable happiness with tangible goals; accomplishments vow to make you an accomplished person — there are no guarantees about being a happy one. Because happiness and being successful are separate pursuits, we never have to view them as impeding one another. So don’t stop taking that step toward your larger aspirations, but simultaneously be cognizant of taking that hour for self-care now. When it comes down to it, I can both strive to graduate from Brown and take the few hours to watch Netflix, guilt-free.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Amidst the incessant focus on President Trump, a terrifying bill in the Iowa legislature has flown under the radar. Last week, the Iowa General Assembly tabled legislation that could dramatically alter the faculty composition in state universities by <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=87&amp;ba=SF288">“balancing”</a> the registered political affiliations of staff members. Under the proposed bill, universities are required to consider political ideology in the hiring process and favor candidates with <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/320442-iowa-republican-wants-to-require-partisan-balance-at-universities">underrepresented political beliefs</a>. Put simply, this would mean favoring right-leaning applicants.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The bill, Iowa Senate File 288, is pitched as a means of <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/20/iowa-senator-wants-political-balance-among-university-professors/98167182/">“promoting diversity of thought”</a> in universities and colleges. Essentially, any state university whose faculty leans Republican or Democrat by a margin over 10 percent cannot hire any more faculty members from the majority party. The sponsor of the bill, Republican Iowa State Senator Mark Chelgren, argues that it will preserve ideological diversity and ensure students are exposed to “different thinking, different processes, different expertise.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At first glance, this act might seem innocuous — after all, diversity of thought seems an admirable goal. But in reality, all it will do is construct a system of ideological discrimination that favors Republican professors and lecturers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As the conservative media has repeatedly bemoaned, modern-day academia is overwhelmingly Democratic. According to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/11/the-dramatic-shift-among-college-professors-thats-hurting-students-education/?utm_term=.dd26c56baac8">Higher Education Research Institute</a>, over 60 percent of professors are liberal. By comparison, approximately 38 percent are moderate and only 12 percent are conservative. In some fields, the numbers are even more skewed: A <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/10/03/voter-registration-data-show-democrats-outnumber-republicans-among-social-scientists">recent study</a> of voter registration data shows that there are 11.5 registered Democrats for every registered Republican in the social sciences. With liberals outnumbering conservatives by a ratio of at least five to one in academia, most university faculties would naturally lean to the left. So Chelgren’s bill doesn’t promote academic diversity; instead, it disproportionately stifles Democratic professors by creating a thinly-veiled quota system that prioritizes conservative views. If that isn’t reminiscent of Orwellian thought policing, I don’t know what is.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though the bill is unlikely to be passed, it still poses a grave concern for students and universities across the country. It represents just one part of a broader movement to curtail academic freedom in liberal institutions. A similar bill was introduced in North Carolina last week, while other bills in Iowa moved to end tenure in public universities and <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/02/21/iowa-bill-would-force-partisan-balance-hiring">limit faculty bargaining rights</a>. A new website, ominously titled “Professor Watchlist,” lists out faculty members who publish liberal articles — or in the website’s words, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/01/25/online-watchlist-targetsbrown-prof-defense-safe-spaces/">“leftist propaganda”</a> — opening up professors to online intimidation and harassment. The Trump administration has also signaled that it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/02/trumps-threat-to-defund-berkeley-after-protest-of-breitbart-writer-makes-no-sense/">could selectively defund universities</a>, spurring concerns that federal funding could be used to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-02/trump-threatens-u-c-berkeley-funding-over-violent-protests">influence public institutions</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yet all of these actions are based on a flawed premise. While professors are more likely to be liberal, studies have proven that they very rarely coerce or brainwash students toward a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/25/AR2011022503169.html">particular ideology</a>. There is also little evidence that suggests university administrations disproportionately <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-gross-academia-conservatives-hiring-20160520-snap-story.html">favor liberal academics</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Don’t get me wrong — I’m all for political diversity among faculty members. Given the rise of political “echo chambers,” it is important that students are exposed to views from different parts of the political spectrum in classrooms. But we should not seek political diversity at the cost of academic and political freedom. Moreover, political affiliation seems like an arbitrary criterion that doesn’t really promote true academic diversity. It may be more effective to seek diversity in experiences, backgrounds, research areas and teaching styles when recruiting faculty, all of which could implicitly lead to greater political diversity in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Iowa bill is a timely reminder of our tenuous grasp on academic freedom. So far, Brown has been relatively untouched by governmental backlash against liberal institutions. But we need to be mindful of the myriad ways that the Trump administration and its allies could influence higher education. In a world full of “alternative facts” and fake news, the Thought Police feel like a not-too-distant reality.</span></p>

		<title>Smith GS: News’ new groove — a liberal reads Breitbart</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the Conservative Political Action Conference last Friday, President Trump intensified his war on the media by berating once again so-called “fake news.” “Fake news doesn’t tell the truth,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/us/politics/white-house-sean-spicer-briefing.html">Trump said</a>. “It doesn’t and never will represent the people, and we’re going to do something about it.” Then, in an unprecedented move, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer barred news organizations deemed unfriendly to the Trump administration from a press conference. The New York Times reported that “reporters from the Times, BuzzFeed News, CNN, the Los Angeles Times, Politico, the BBC and the Huffington Post were among those shut out of the briefing.” News organizations permitted to attend the briefing included the conservative-leaning Washington Times, One America News Network and Breitbart.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is scary. Trump and Bannon have turned the media into a battleground, with the likes of the New York Times on one side and the right-wing Breitbart axis on the other. Last week’s press briefing is an unnerving example of how the Trump administration can elevate organizations like Breitbart by denying its competitors a seat at the table. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-made-breitbart-great-again/">Estimates indicate</a> that 10 percent of Americans now get their news primarily from Breitbart — a number high enough to merit attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1">As a liberal, I hadn’t read Breitbart before last week. I first heard of it when Steve Bannon became chief strategist at the White House, but I dismissed its reach as insignificant. Recently, though, I decided to give the website a look — mostly out of curiosity and partially out of a desire to diversify my news intake. I wanted to step outside of my comfortable echo chamber of news, which is normally limited to the New York Times and New Yorker, to see what a significant portion of the American public reads.</p>
<p class="p1">The first thing I noticed was Breitbart’s unusual aesthetic. Its logo is a white, block-letter B encased in an orange square, and its headlines change from black to orange font when you hover over them. The bright, oscillating colors and doomsday headlines evoke a sense of combativeness and malcontent. Breitbart’s aesthetic, coupled with unabashedly right-leaning articles, leave the reader with no choice but to feel vaguely angry and pessimistic about the state of world affairs. It supplies news with an attitude.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My initial impulse was to reject the website in its entirety and never visit it again. It evoked feelings of unease and frustration, and its views were morally suspect. But as I thought about it more, I realized it was doing something significant that I couldn’t ignore: Through web design and selective reporting, it was curating news to produce a specific reaction.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Breitbart has no interest in creating the impression that it is a passive, innocent messenger merely relaying the news of the day. It embraces and champions its role as a news curator. Breitbart does not just report the news — it reports the news its way. Through a combination of web layout, headlines and article content, Breitbart ensures that readers will react in the way that it wants: with a feeling that, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/reading-breitbart-news-steve-bannon-donald-trump">Guardian’s Adam Ga</a><span class="s1">bbatt phrased it, “the world is going to hell in a handbasket … unless our guys can fix it.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is significant because Breitbart is redefining the relationship between news organizations and truth. For the likes of the New York Times, the Boston Globe and the Washington Post, accurate reporting is paramount, and the truth is rooted in objectivity. For Breitbart, the truth is that the world is in disarray, and reporting is a means of communicating that reality. Breitbart is busy driving a wedge between the assumed, natural relationship between truth and news.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Breitbart has re-envisioned the news website, not as a place where people go to learn about current events, but as a place that tells them how to feel about current events. In Breitbart’s world, truth takes a back seat to emotion. If it can succeed in its mission to change the role of news, then “news” itself could become subjective — something that we embrace or reject emotionally, rather than interpret intellectually. This would mark an unsettling victory for the Trump administration in its war on the media and truth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hope Breitbart’s project fails. In the meantime, I’m going to cling to the New York Times for dear life.</span></p>

		<title>Vilsan &#039;19: West doesn’t know best</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">We’ve all heard the soapbox speech before: The politically precarious governments of Eastern Europe have a lot to learn about organized democracy from established Western states. Throughout the 20th century, Western democracies inserted themselves into the communist bloc like fatherly figures to fix governmental inefficiencies and preach the virtues of political freedom. Yet, as governments across the globe experience political instability, it seems that citizens of the Western world have a lesson or two about democracy to learn from an unlikely teacher: Romania. In the first months of 2017, the Romanian people have proven themselves far more capable of overcoming political allegiances to confront corruption — no matter what side of the aisle it may come from.</p>
<p class="p3">While the American media was busy analyzing President Trump’s first weeks in office, the new government in Romania unleashed a unique set of scandals. Not unlike the United States, the Romanian governmental transition has had its fair share of turbulence. After officials released an emergency ordinance legalizing small-scale governmental corruption in the middle of the night on Jan. 31, Romanians took to the streets in protest.</p>
<p class="p3">Political division is a fact of life in Romania, as the public is generally split into five major political parties with very different visions for the country. Political corruption, unfortunately, is similarly well established, partly as a result of the nation’s tumultuous recovery from its communist past. But, this month, Romanians proved that they can look beyond party lines and unite to move beyond a history of political violence and corruption.</p>
<p class="p3">While American televisions lit up with images of protests in airports and state houses, Romanian media outlets scrambled to cover one of the nation’s largest revolts since the fall of communist rule. Citizens organized an inspiring and unifying movement against the abuse of governmental power. It became clear that, regardless of their political affiliations, Romanians are unwilling to let corruption run its course in the dead of night.</p>
<p class="p3">The emergency ordinance was repealed within days of the large-scale public outrage, and Minister of Justice Florin Iordache resigned from his post. But this reversal did little to appease protesters, who continue to demand governmental accountability and a permanent governmental re-organization that would prohibit the creation of future corrupt ordinances.</p>
<p class="p3">This national uproar has deeper roots than momentary anger at a legislative misstep. Overnight, citizens decided that, above all, they are Romanians with a shared interest in promoting national success and political progress. Put simply, they’re fed up with a system that allows the political elite to take advantage of laws and pull strings when they think no one’s watching. The protests in Romania this month are perhaps the most inspiring examples of modern democracy at work: a people united by a common cause, acting in the interest of their nation.</p>
<p class="p3">So what can the West learn from the Romanian example? Isn’t this just a case of a formerly communist nation still struggling to expel corruption from its top levels of government? After all, Romanian <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/europe/romania-protests-corruption.html?_r=0">political analyst Sorin Ionita</a> believes that, unlike the West, “Romanian political cleavage is not left against right, it is corruption versus anti-corruption.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are the Romanian people lagging behind in internalizing the lesson that nobody is above the law, or is it leading the way in outspoken, fiery demands for accountability? I would argue the latter.</p>
<p class="p3">As American politicians extend their concerns and best wishes to Romania, they would be well-served to look internally before brushing the Romanian example off as an Eastern European phenomenon. Throughout several administrations and election cycles, the political elites on both sides of the aisle have been able to dismiss suspicious ties and criminally tainted pasts with a sequence of vague press conferences and diversion tactics. It may seem as though politics in the West are consumed entirely by partisan issues and that Westerners have transcended the fundamental flaws of democratic governance. But, upon closer inspection, some issues aren’t subject to ideological opinion — they belong on the right versus wrong spectrum.</p>
<p class="p3">From the manipulation tactics of the Democratic National Committee in the election of Hillary Clinton to Trump’s undisclosed tax returns, politicians in both major parties have provoked scandals deserving of bipartisan condemnation. In the 2016 Democratic primary, high-level members of the party obviously favored a Clinton win and acted on this preference. Outrage over this meddling should not have been limited to supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT. Meanwhile, Trump has admitted to taking advantage of loopholes in tax laws to avoid paying his fair share for years. It is the responsibility of American citizens as a whole to protest this evasion, regardless of political affiliation. Yet, throughout the election, voters and politicians were willing to excuse the indiscretions of their own parties while denouncing the opposition for its oversteps. It is clear, from these examples, that the American democratic system is far from squeaky-clean. Corruption and political dishonesty continue to be a real problem, not a matter of partisan subjectivity, and they should be treated as such.</p>
<p class="p3">In an increasingly divided political climate, we’ve learned to brand ourselves according to the political niches that separate us. We’ve begun treating issues that should be on the right versus wrong spectrum as matters of personal opinion and party alliance. All is forgotten once the necessary votes are won. It is easy to cast stones across the pond and blame other governments for stepping out of legal bounds, especially when you’re sitting on the Western side. However, before stepping back up on the soapbox, it is worthwhile to reexamine the American political culture and whether political scandals are the partisan phenomena they are made out to be.</p>

		<title>Cardoso ’19: Friend of the court, foe of Trumpism</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/28/cardoso-19-friend-court-foe-trumpism/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The response to President Trump’s recent executive immigration order was swift and harsh, eliciting opposition from a motley crew of tech corporations, European diplomats and American national security experts, among many others. On Feb. 13, Brown, along with 16 other universities, joined the fray by submitting an amicus curiae brief — a legal document submitted by a non-litigant to an appellate court — in opposition to the ban. And as it should — the ban affects several students and disrupts the University’s efforts to attract scholars from around the world. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, the pertinent question here is not the wisdom of Brown’s objection to the ban — it is clearly justified in seeking to protect members of our community from the dangerous and inept policy experimentation of the nascent Trump administration. No, instead, the astute observer might ask whether the brief will actually accomplish anything. Wouldn’t it be inappropriate for the University to wade so deep into the political mire if its participation amounted to little more than grandstanding?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In fact, I don’t think so. Amicus briefs are, indeed, of marginal efficacy when it comes to court decisions. Research suggests that while amicus briefs can influence the decisions of the courts, individual briefs themselves often have no substantial impact on the outcome of a case, and what impact they do have can be counteracted by more briefs on behalf of the other litigant. Additionally, not all briefs are made equally. Data suggests that some amici are more influential than others, and Brown (or any university for that matter) does not sit very high on the ladder. Presumably, on hot button political issues where the ideological composition of the court is on full display, amicus briefs are even less useful in influencing the outcome. Of course, the arguments provided by amici might eventually contribute to the reasoning of the court’s opinion, but not necessarily whether the case will swing in favor of either party. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No, the metric by which we should assess the University’s decision to file a brief shouldn’t strictly be whether or not it can expect success in the court — because frankly, the decision won’t be influenced one way or the other by Brown’s brief alone — but rather, whether it can protect the members of our community in the long term. And by taking a public position on the issue, it can. Indeed, taking a public position is more than grandstanding — when powerful institutions like Brown and the other amici that filed briefs aggregate their influence and stake out a position, they are able to influence public opinion. The public begins to focus on widespread opposition among tech companies, foreign leaders and universities, which shapes how the public views the issue, and ultimately, this places pressure on the administration to reconsider its policy (at least in theory). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The other dimension of the objection to Brown filing an amicus brief — that universities, like celebrities, should keep their mouths shut about politics — is not only an arbitrary construction meant to stifle the dialogue, but is the exact opposite of what we should expect from those with privilege in society. The notion that universities exist in some political vacuum and that complaints about their involvement in political issues is anything more than partisan bickering is basically nonsense. Influential institutions like Brown have an obligation to insert themselves right into the eye of the political maelstrom to protect their students, faculty and — of equal importance — their principles. Even if the logic of shaping public opinion is unconvincing after the most basic precepts of political behavior seem to have been suspended in the past two years, at the very least, by filing an amicus brief, the University shows solidarity with its affected community members in the most politically engaged way it can.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ultimately, while Brown’s amicus brief will likely be inconsequential in shaping the court’s opinion, its decision to enter the political conversation on behalf of its students is a good call. And of course, Brown hasn’t always used its amicus briefs in the most constructive way, and it should be rightfully held accountable when it strays from what should be its primary goal — protecting its students and faculty. But its decision to file a brief against the travel ban, though legally negligible, is worthy of a nod of approval.</span></p>

		<title>Campbell &#039;18: Clouds of stress descend on Spring Weekend</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Apart from a flubbed announcement on the part of a certain Atlanta rapper, there isn’t a lot we know about this year’s Spring Weekend. There remains much to announce, with potential artists, rain calls and more up in the air. But we do know about one major detail — the date. For those who don’t already know, Spring Weekend is scheduled for Apr. 28 through Apr. 30,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>otherwise known as the first three days of reading period. This odd and inexplicable decision by the Student Activities Office undermines the entire purpose of Spring Weekend.</p>
<p class="p3">Spring Weekend is ostensibly a chance for Brown students to blow off some ste<span class="s1">am by having fun in the (fingers crossed) sun with their peers before spring semester finals. On the face of it, the beginning of reading period seems like an ideal time for this: It might cut into studying a bit, but as long as students recover quickly, it shouldn’t affect them much. But in reality, this timing is far from perfect. SAO may have been motivated by the timing of Coachella; scheduling Spring Weekend for the week after might have made it easier to book artists, yet past lineups show how little of a problem this has been.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Next to the stress and commitments associated with finals, Coachella’s effect on Spring Weekend simply does not compare. Spring Weekend has now been placed smack in the middle of the virtual avalanche of assignments that is the final week of the semester and reading period. The percentage of classes with major assignments due during reading period is difficult to quantify, but I can attest that I have two finals in the week immediately preceding Spring Weekend and three in the week immediately following. That’s hardly a scenario that would allow for three days of carefree revelry. I’m hardly alone in this. For example, POLS 0110: “Introduction to Political Thought,” a class with nearly 100 enrolled students, has a paper due the Monday following Spring Weekend. And Spring Weekend falls smack in the middle of the last project for CSCI 0160: “Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures” —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a course with 232 students. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ultimately, SAO’s decision demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how reading period works. Far from a peaceful respite for studying before finals begin, reading period consists of a blur of papers and tests that make the actual finals period look almost tame in comparison. SAO should understand this, given that they state in their Reading and Finals Period Event Approval Policy that “large scale concerts, parties and events with alcohol are not permitted during reading period.” If that description does not evoke images of Spring Weekend, I would challenge you to find me any sentence that does.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Of course, one solution would be for professors to grant reading period more respect. After all, it is intended to be a period of study for upcoming assignments, not a blitz of essays and tests in its own right. But this is a much larger issue. This proposal is difficult to achieve because of the nature of large research papers and projects in many courses — assignments that could not be thoroughly completed during finals period alone and necessarily drift into reading period. Reading period has been around for a long time, and presumably professors have figured out the best way to use it. Besides, for all the importance put on Spring Weekend, it obviously comes second to students’ more pressing academic concerns. The point of Spring Weekend is to allow students three days to de-stress, yet by placing it within reading period, SAO has sabotaged both students’ study plans and capacity to fully relax.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you aren’t familiar with Brown’s schedule, it might not be immediately apparent just how unfortunate and ill-advised this scheduling is. But SAO members must understand how reading period works, especially given that their office has published an entire policy on the subject. This erroneous choice represents an enormous lapse of judgment. No date would please everyone, but we could have at least avoided a date that pleases no one.</span></p>

		<title>Jacobs &#039;18: The case against pure economics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Rates of return, growth patterns, mathematical variables and curves. This is the image of m<span class="s1">odern economics.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At first glance, it might be tempting to think that economics has discovered the elusive secret of using the scientific method to study the way humans interact — emerging victorious in the battle of social sciences. And, indeed, students and employers are increasingly viewing economics as the most practical concentration in the social sciences. At Brown, economics is one of the most popular concentrations, and the number of students studying it has risen by nearly 40 percent between 2008 and 2012. There are also signs that this number will continue to grow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And yet, despite the many benefits of studying economics, we should be wary about its increasing dominance as a lens to make sense of socio-political life. Though economics offers a quantitative approach to social science that other fields might not offer, the endless graphs, econometric statistics and micro- and macro-economic analyses cannot project a complete image of public life on their own.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What’s missing in this is the humanity of economics — the “social” in social sciences. Let’s take the example of the minimum wage. When a minimum wage is imposed on the economy — distorting the market and potentially producing greater unemployment — economists are trained to point out this apparent inefficiency. What is often obscured in subsequent discussions is an analysis of the political and ethical reasons for imposing such a wage control.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In many cases, the minimum wage is preferable to more economically acceptable alternatives because it can be easier to maintain politically — it’s difficult to reduce a minimum wage once it’s been imposed. Moreover, there’s no consideration of the idea that governments have an ethical responsibility to ensure their citizens earn a living wage. Economics curricula generally do not teach us to think about the impacts of economic policies on human well-being, quality of life, fulfillment or happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nowhere is this idea more apparent than in the debate over long-run and short-run economic gain. For example, economics classes teach us the benefits of free trade in terms of its impact on long-run economic growth,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>increases in productivity and collective wealth. But what do these long-run proclamations actually mean to the manufacturing workers who have seen their jobs shipped overseas and demand for their labor relinquished? What kind of consolation could pronouncements about long-run growth possibly be?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And though long-run economic growth and productivity are undoubtedly important, they are elements that alone cannot determine how best to live our lives and increase societal happiness and fulfillment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Beyond this, economics is often marked by tacit ethical and behavioral assumptions: For example, a high unemployment rate is to be avoided, low interest rates can be good because they stimulate investment or price controls produce market inefficiency. When engaging with such topics, students are asked to mechanically find a correct answer as they would on a mathematics exam.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But a comprehensive understanding of social sciences requires much more. In our economics classes, we attempt to reduce the impact of boom-bust cycles, but we don’t ask why they happen. We don’t ask whether unemployment is necessarily a bad thing. We don’t ask whether quality of life always increases in congruence with economic growth. And we don’t consider the historical and cultural reasons why people behave the way they do — rather we rely on a flawed understanding of humans as inherently self-interested, rational actors. These are assumptions that would be, at best, deeply questionable to those exposed to other disciplines. Above all, they indicate the insufficiency of using pure economics to develop one’s world view.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In saying this, I am not criticizing economics in a broad sense or belittling its importance — to do so would be absurd. The virtues of economics are undeniable; it is an essential tool for developing a nuanced understanding of politics, world affairs and history. Anyone who purports to take politics and public engagement seriously would be doing themselves a disservice if they failed to develop a rudimentary understanding of economics and market functions. But the reverse is also true: Anyone passionate about economics should look to other disciplines to add nuance to their course of study.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">More economic students should look outside their own concentration. In particular, they should look toward subjects like history, sociology, political science, psychology and philosophy to enhance their perspective on how economics fits into the web of other social sciences. By doing so, students will have more nuanced opinions about world events. More importantly, economics departments should reframe their curricula to encourage more interdisciplinary learning — something our economics department<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>has not convincingly done.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We should remember that economics is best understood as a component, not the sum, of the social sciences.</span></p>

		<title>Liang &#039;19: What’s in a name?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I enjoy writing down my middle name for people and then watching them butcher it out loud. Go ahead, try it: it’s written in English as Chih-Wei, but the actual phonetic sound varies depending on whether someone is using a Mandarin, Cantonese or Taiwanese dialect. All for a name meaning “Great Intelligence.” Go figure.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For three generations, my family has kept this tradition of making our Chinese names official on paper while keeping them hidden in our middle names. You can call us Grace, Raymond, Angela and Julie. We all have normal American first names and traditional Chinese middle and last names. I say “normal” in that we will never be chastised by recent Oscar hosts for not having “a real name.” It’s normal in that my first name ranks on the list of “hottest names that will get you the most dates,” along with creative names such as Tyler, Andy and Zach. I’ll only get cringing attempts at airports and the DMV, rather than on a daily basis. Though of course, my last name still means I’m going to have fewer job interviews, according to studies from Ryerson University and the University of Toronto.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I like my name — all of it. It’s indicative of my rich Chinese and American heritage, and I’m proud to live up to it. But I understand why my parents named me Mark Chih-Wei rather than Chih-Wei Mark. As immigrants, they chose to play a game with the odds stacked in my favor as much as possible — in a country that still doesn’t play fair to everyone. They named me in the same way that many East Asian international students at this school choose an American name, either to fit in or better their job or social prospects. There are critics to this choice of my parents to “hide” my “real” name into the background. There’s also equal criticism of those who choose to keep their names when integrating into different communities — for example, when a Texas legislator recommended in testimony that all people of Chinese, Japanese and Korean descent should change their names to be “easier for Americans to deal with.” Here’s to all the Joe’s and Shao-Wei’s and Crystal’s who have to navigate that maze, because I still surely am.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We are entitled to these names because these identifiers arise from our lived cultural experiences. Names have a unique paradox of being both inherently ours and exhibited for the world to see. It’s like the unwritten rules in the American deaf community, where sign names are mutually decided by an individual and the collective whole, rather than cherry-picked by anyone wanting to feel “hip.” Some people like Muhammad Ali have rejected so-called “slave names,” offering signs of white resistance and embracing other cultures. Others, like a good chunk of East Asian immigrants, take the opposite stance. They embraced “American (i.e. white)” names as a promise for financial and social gain in a new country. These names become contracts between people and between worlds.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We reach interesting problems when that kind of relationship becomes one-sided. It’s Kimmel laughing at a name like Yulerie, but accepting Patrick; or when someone like Rachel Anne Dolezal changes her name to Nkechi Amare Diallo, which has roots in Igbo and Fula origins despite her being neither Nigerian nor raised Muslim. Names should be dialogues, not call and responses. Some people may argue that names are just that: words that are simply what people choose to identify with. But that’s just not true — names carry huge cultural and social significance and should be treated as such. Just look at couples figuring out what last name to take after marriage, or people choosing to change their names to fit into new communities or identities. You have to have agency in your name, but you also have to respect the sensitivities and power constructs that come with them. By all means, change your name to Nick or Stacy if you so wish. But if you even for a second consider Jesus or Leong or Devante, try again. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some final advice: Unless you lived with a Chinese family who gave you a name or actually did your research, please stop calling yourself “white lotus flower” or “Tiger Lily” or whatever name you think sounds good in a different language but has no actual significance (also, don’t tattoo it to your butt). I know your heart is in the right place, but changing a name to become culturally “aware” is just wrong for someone who doesn’t face the same experiences as those who have to face discrimination. Just use the phonetics, and if you think Chinese butchers your Anglo-Saxon name, welcome to my world.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am still not over the break-up: Though it has been over a year since Jon Stewart announced his retirement, I still miss him every Monday through Thursday at 11 p.m. 42 weeks out of the year. I understand that break-ups are never easy. You get your heart broken, you mourn the loss, you go through some rebounds and eventually you move on. But I have come to realize that there are two reasons why I might never move on from Stewart: First, his recent TV reappearance reminded me, once again, that his brand of political commentary is completely unique and irreplaceable. Second, the rebound guy just isn’t filling the shoes that Stewart left empty — suddenly and badly timed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recently, Stewart <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdFne7LnuA">joined Stephen Colbert</a> on “The Late Show” to tell the American media to get its groove back and to remind all of us that without Stewart, American audiences have lost their groove too. During his brief appearance, he gave us everything we had been craving in our state of Stewart withdrawal: He performed an unrestrained impression of President Trump, made Colbert sweat a little by yelling about Tom, Drudge and Breitbart “doing anal” and dished out some tough love, telling the media to “take up a hobby, perhaps journalism.” It was all very frank and provocative, descriptions that I consider synonymous with Stewart — almost exclusively so.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ever since I bid farewell to my side bangs and Green Day t-shirt as a seventh grader in Turkey, I have been invested in political news. Stewart’s segments on “The Daily Show” allowed me to follow news cycles in a country that imposed serious limitations on free press. Like so many audiences around the world, I was immediately and devotedly drawn to his bold and unapologetic humor, unabashed partisanship, dutiful scrutiny and poignant criticism. I didn’t need Stewart to get my news — I needed him to tell me what to think about it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But as someone who never needed additional encouragement to keep up with political news, I wasn’t the most significant object of Stewart’s magnetism. The truth is that millennials <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinebeaton/2016/11/04/whymillennialsarentvoting/#2aa58c0989c2">don’t vote</a>, and they <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kristy-gustafson/why-many-millennials-coul_b_9773258.html">couldn’t care less</a> about politics. Yet Stewart somehow got my notoriously disaffected and apolitical generation interested in politics! He did so by making the radical claim that, since political news is often unsettling and emotive, its delivery can and should be opinionated, angry, loud and, at the very least, substantial. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He didn’t just hit the highlights of the daily newspapers and throw in a couple of puns attacking the Republican Party ad hominem. He selected issues that personally affected him and the American audiences he was so stubbornly devoted to stirring. He never denied being opinionated in his delivery, but he remained conscious of the impact his brand of opinion authorship had and used his power very carefully.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is no secret that Americans live and breathe television. In a 65-year life, the average American spends nine years <a href="https://www.csun.edu/science/health/docs/tv&amp;health.html">staring at a TV screen</a>. Viewers overwhelmingly trusted the “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” as their source of news: More than one in 10 young adults said they trusted “The Daily Show” or its now-departed spinoff, “The Colbert Report,” to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/30/jon-stewart-will-leave-plenty-of-millennials-in-search-of-a-new-way-to-get-their-news/">tell them about political news</a>. It is safe to say that many Americans got the truth, not from the heavily rhetorical, stale speeches of politicians, but from the precious moments when Stewart’s quick wit caught them off guard and provided us with <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/03/why-we-still-miss-jon-stewart/426840/">glimpses of honesty</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stewart’s successor, Trevor Noah, is more comfortable on TV, on camera and in the studio. While Stewart twitched, twirled, snarled and oozed exasperation in his seat, Noah occupies the same seat with an aura of sleek, easy charisma. At 33 years old, he is much more marketable in his stylish suits and his melodic South African accent. His composed voice rarely even grazes the peaks and troughs that Stewart’s frantic rants used to reach on a daily basis. Cool and collected is an understatement when describing Noah in relative terms. But what made Stewart so engaging and relatable was precisely his discomfort, not only in relation to the political fiascos he discussed, but also in his position behind the camera. With Stewart, “The Daily Show” always felt like a heated conversation at the Thanksgiving table, whereas with Noah, the audience is constantly aware that he is just a charming guy reading a script on camera.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I gave the rebound a fair chance. Noah has had a year to gain some confidence and experience, become invested in American politics and grow out of his caution and timidity. And yet, save for his truly amazing Ben Carson impression and his decidedly insightful handling of issues related to race, he still falls flat. Perhaps most disappointing are the constant strikeouts at the interview portions of the show, which used to always be highlights during the Stewart era. I remember watching the episode in which <a href="http://time.com/4599128/daily-show-obama-trevor-noah-review/">Noah interviewed former President Barack Obama</a> — and that’s about it. I’m certain that I watched the entire thing — and with high expectations, given that the interview came at such a critical time in Obama’s tenure — but I recall nothing from the substance of the interview due to the uninspiring, open-ended and vague probes Noah tossed the former president’s way.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So there it is: I still miss Jon Stewart. I miss him because his courage and knack for inspiring, relevant and constructive political insight made him irreplaceable. I miss him because Trevor Noah still hasn’t found his voice or his guts. But most of all, I miss him because American audiences (as well as audiences worldwide) need his reprimands and advice now more than ever in the backdrop of today’s climate — dangerously far-right, extremist populism coupled with political apathy, desensitization and compassion fatigue.</span></p>

		<title>Miller ’19: Why not Brown?</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/06/miller-19-not-brown/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since President Christina Paxson P’19 announced her Building on Distinction plan in 2013, the administration has had to negotiate how it will reconcile its long-term strategy with our university-college model. Here is one suggestion: Brown should reinvigorate its long dormant effort to expand and create graduate professional schools. Brown, along with Princeton and Dartmouth, remains one of the only schools in the Ivy League without a law school, while Princeton and Brown are the only two without a business school. The remaining Ivy League schools collectively enroll thousands of students in some of the finest graduate and post-graduate professional programs in the country. Why not Brown?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are several factors that explain the absence of more professional schools at Brown. These include former University President Henry Wriston’s opposition to professional schools, a narrow interpretation of the college charter and its definition of a liberal arts education and Brown’s focus on the undergraduate experience. The cost, physical space and diversion of administrative energy are also major constraints.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in the 21st century, it is anachronistic to view professional schools, including law schools and business schools, as trade schools rather than extensions of a liberal arts education. Indeed, many would argue they are a natural culmination of that education. Not everyone needs to love or even appreciate these fields of study, but the presence of these schools on campus will undoubtedly encourage the cross-pollination of ideas — a value entirely consistent with a liberal arts education. In this way, every student at Brown may benefit from exposure to the same knowledge and platforms offered by Brown’s Ivy League counterparts with professional schools. With such schools, Brown will only be better positioned to further its mission and attract a new generation of graduate students and faculty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is why Brown should focus its long-term energy on creating and expanding its graduate program to include professional degrees. It would be inconceivable to produce a high-quality professional school in a matter of years, but Brown should consider factoring this into its long-term vision. Other U.S. schools have implemented similar large-scale expansions despite the effort, expense and risk. These universities have been rewarded with additional revenue that outweighs the short-term costs, providing a useful model for Brown’s future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Brown must start somewhere: The snowball cannot begin to run without a deliberate push forward. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brown’s College Charter does not discourage professional graduate schools and, in fact, supports them. The charter charges the University’s Trustees and Fellows “to found a College or University … for promoting liberal arts and universal literature.” Graduate professional studies like law or business emphasize universal literature and align with the goals of a liberal arts model. Professional schools would not only train future professionals and executives, but also further legal jurisprudence and corporate responsibility, improving the lives of individuals and communities nationwide.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of establishing a new graduate school within the University is not unprecedented. Brown’s Alpert Medical School was founded in 1975, a fairly recent event in the annals of academic history. Alpert has seen success, attracting funding and new applicants to Brown. In its short life, it has been acclaimed as one of the best medical schools<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in the United States, enhancing Brown’s reputation while providing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>resources and staff to local hospitals serving the region. In 2013, research conducted by the faculty and the clinical departments of Alpert attracted $280 million in external funding. Alpert has allowed students interested in medicine to participate firsthand in medical research, thereby enhancing the pre-medical experience. The number of pre-medical applications to Brown has risen since the medical school was created, and we can likely attribute this to the fount of knowledge and access created by Alpert.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brown has already begun to redefine its university-college model with its School of Professional Studies and the addition of the School of Public Health in 2013. Dean of the School of Public Health Terrie Wetle said during the School of Public Health’s inception that it would serve as a “recruitment magnet” and appeal to the highest quality of graduate students and faculty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The addition of other professional schools would serve a similar purpose. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brown’s unique political climate and highly motivated student body present an ideal setting for the learning opportunities provided by professional schools. Brown’s mission states that the University should serve “the community, the nation and the world by discovering, communicating and preserving knowledge and understanding in a spirit of free inquiry, and by educating and preparing students to discharge the offices of life with usefulness and reputation.” Wouldn’t an expansion of our professional schools do just that?</span></p>

		<title>Johnson ’19: An even more political Oscars, please?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of many moments of discomfort at this year’s Academy Awards was when a group of Hollywood tourists walked through the front row of the Dolby Theatre in the middle of the show. Jimmy Kimmel, the host of the night, led the tour group in front of the stage, introducing them to icons like Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington. The tourists’ average street clothes appeared ridiculous in the theater full of sparkling gowns and diamonds. Their shocked faces and effusive disbelief were filmed as jokes, offered as tributes to light-hearted comedy relief. But Kimmel, pressured to include crowd interaction, instead created a condescending parade of stars. And on top of the elitist taste of the segment, Kimmel went on to imply that a tourist, Yulerie, had an illegitimate name because it didn’t sound American enough. “Now that’s a name,” Kimmel said to the man named Patrick next to her.</p>
<p class="p1">The Oscars are meant to celebrate the art of film — but, of course, nothing can escape politics. Discomforting moments like the tourists’ detour were sprinkled throughout the evening: Kimmel made light of Mahershala Ali’s name after he became the first black Muslim actor to win an Oscar; Mel Gibson, a vocal anti-Semite, reen<span class="s1">tered Hollywood’s graces; and Casey Affleck, who was accused of sexual harassment, received his Oscar from Brie Larson — the actress who played an assault survivor in “Room.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Oscars race became politicized long before the awards night itself. Leading up to the event, “La La Land” became a symbol of Hollywood’s past, playing on the nostalgia that many still feel for the film industry’s “glory days” — an era when Hollywood was even more homogenous and inward-looking than it is now. “Moonlight,” by comparison, was <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/moonlight-makes-oscars-history-1st-lgbtq-best-picture-winner-n726116">hailed</a> as the a groundbreaking film that broke stereotypes and featured diverse narratives. Last week, Daniel Wayland ’18 (“Polarized political binary should not extend to popular culture,” March 1) wrote a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/01/wayland-18-polarized-political-binary-not-extend-popular-culture/">column</a> in The Herald critiquing the emphasis on this political binary between the two films. But we shouldn’t make art less political — we should embrace the opportunity art provides for discourse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aren’t more words, rather than less, needed to address racism and intolerance? Award shows —</span> especially ones on the scale of the Oscars — are powerful platforms. The Oscars reached a <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-oscars-drop-again-early-numbers-980854">startling</a> 32.9 million viewers this year, making the connection between the films’ messages and national politics more important than ever. Politics will always be relevant to arts and culture because politics affect every aspect of life. Art does not exist in a vacuum — it operates in the context of social and political change.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was tension in this year’s Oscars, and it wasn’t between the polarized right and left. The tension was between those who used their microphone to denounce hatred and those who failed to use this platform. President Trump’s policies are not just conservative — they are racist. Given the enormous platform the Oscars offers, speakers can and should have used their reach to oppose his intolerance.</span></p>
<p class="p1">This was not the time for a bevy of apolitical platitudes in acceptance speeches. The most powerful and moving speeches acknowledged and critiqued the current political climate. A few acceptance speeches were eloquent and powerful. Viola Davis stressed the importance of telling the stories of those who cannot tell their own. Iranian award recipient Asghar Farhardi did not attend, and his acceptance statement <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39100897">dedicated</a> his absence to those affected by Trump’s immigration ban.</p>
<p class="p1">But many celebrities fell short where Davis and Farhardi shone. Emma Stone subtly wore a Planned Parenthood <a href="http://time.com/4683198/oscars-2017-emma-stone-planned-parenthood/">pin</a>, but never vocalized her support for women’s reproductive health. Many others did not attempt to use their fame to call on the millions of viewers. Just like in the segment with the star-struck Hollywood tourists, there was a divide between the artificial glamor and reality.</p>
<p class="p1">Political acceptance speeches are nothing new, nor do they adversely affect the Oscars viewership. According to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/21/entertainment/oscar-ratings-partisan-tune-out/">CNN</a>, these speeches have never dissuaded conservatives from tuning in at 8:30 p.m. on a Sunday night. These speeches were a chance for artists to move beyond “echo chambers” and reach people from all political spheres.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course the Oscars is an award show designed to entertain. But our nation is not normal right now. Kimmel’s jokes, often mean and problematic, will not unite our country. Unity takes compassion and awareness of other perspectives; our nation’s politics simply don’t reflect those ideals right now.</p>
<p class="p1">As Viola Davis said in her <a href="http://oscar.go.com/news/winners/viola-davis-delivers-powerful-oscar-2017-speech-for-actress-in-a-supporting-role">speech</a>, we need to exhume and exalt the ordinary people. Even the Oscars, with its red carpet and glittering stars, has the potential to teach us that.</p>

		<title>Jacobs &#039;18: The narcissism of social media politics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">We’ve all seen social media’s power to catalyze political change by providing users with a platform to organize and share ideas. After all, the Arab Spring clearly benefited from the proliferation of Facebook throughout the Arab world — approximately nine out of 10 Egyptians and Tunisians reported that they <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/facebook-and-twitter-key-to-arab-spring-uprisings-report">used social media</a> to participate in protests. Here at Brown, taking part in a local protest has never been easier: We’ll see an intriguing Facebook event while scrolling through our newsfeeds, and within seconds, we can designate ourselves as participants.</p>
<p class="p3">Despite these clear advantages, the rise of social media as a platform for political discourse has had some very pernicious consequences. Perhaps the most widely acknowledged criticism of using social media as a platform for news and politics has been the formation of political “echo chambers” that insulate us from contrarian perspectives, prescribing a diet of information almost exclusively composed of arguments we agree with. In particular, <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/">many recent articles</a> have detailed how Facebook conditions our newsfeeds to match our political preferences. The results of this are quite clear: increased polarization, a lack of nuance and, above all, a blunted ability to understand and empathize with other perspectives.</p>
<p class="p3">These effects are compounded by the self-oriented nature of social media. On platforms like Facebook, we tend to create profiles that cast flattering images of ourselves. Much of Facebook — where the items you like, friends you have, articles you share and posts you write are all open to the community — is about cultivating an image. This is as relevant for 20-year-old pre-professionals with calculated, pristine and sophisticated profile pictures as it is for those that have transformed their walls into bastions for memes, dark humor and obscure irony.</p>
<p class="p3">When we engage in political discourse on Facebook — by sharing an article, writing an impassioned post or exhorting onlookers to sign a petition — we are generally conscious of how our online behavior will be perceived. This works alongside the desire to be accepted — and even praised — by the social communities that we inhabit. What results from this is a kind of neutering of political discussion on sites like Facebook; we choose to post things that will be approved by our Facebook friends and generally supported. Politics is thus inextricably linked to our feelings of social capital.</p>
<p class="p3">Consider, for instance, when someone shares a New York Times video depicting the plight of Syrians or the brutality of Boko Haram in Nigeria. Viewers who see the post on their newsfeeds are not simply engaging with the video alone; they are also responding to a third party — the person who posted it.</p>
<p class="p3">Thus, through social media, the tragedies of impoverished and war-torn communities become interconnected with our public images. World events that have nothing to do with us are suddenly used to gain likes and win approval on social media platforms, and it’s frequently done through the commodification of injustice, horror and unspeakable cruelty. Though this type of “virtue signaling” may incentivize greater political involvement online, I think this is a repugnant and narcissistic way to engage with politics.</p>
<p class="p3">The issue is exacerbated by the nature of social media platforms themselves — in particular, their cold ambivalence to the content they facilitate. And I know any person reading this will know exactly what I’m talking about — your Facebook newsfeed might read something like this:</p>
<p class="p3">“Buzzfeed has posted a video of drunk girls reacting to puppies”; “A U.S. airstrike hits a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan”; <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“J.K. Rowling says we should not pronounce the ‘T’ in Voldemort”.</p>
<p class="p3">On Facebook, everything is given the same visibility. Every post has “reaction” options and a comments section (best avoided). And everything is funneled into the currents of superfluous information, the endless monotony of cheap entertainment and engineered dopamine rushes. The abhorrence and triumphs in world news becomes inseparable from everything else, blunting our sensitivity to violence and injustice as well as our empathy for others. The war game montage plays in 1080p right above footage from the real war.</p>
<p class="p3">Of course, social media does not have to be desensitizing force and beacon for narcissistic politics. But we need to seriously reevaluate how we engage with politics and world affairs on these platforms. In particular, we should all consider why we share the articles we do and what we hope to gain by writing impassioned posts on Facebook. By looking inwards toward our own reasons for political engagement on social media platforms, we might become a bit more understanding of one another and genuine in our compassion.</p>

		<title>Colby &#039;20: Learning from the plight of Republicans</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last Thursday Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-WI, made the imprudent decision to travel up to Providence, Rhode Island for a meeting with a local nonprofit, Year Up. Unsurprisingly, he was met with hundreds of protesters <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/02/paul-ryans-ri-visit-youth-education-programs-elicits-protests/">chanting “Coward!”</a> These demonstrators were energized by various issues ranging from Ryan’s support of President Trump to Congress’ impending repeal of Obamacare. Ryan has championed dismantling Obamacare, telling constituents to expect repeal and replacement by <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2017/01/25/house-speaker-paul-ryan-slates-obamacare-repeal-for-spring/">March or April</a>. It is now March and just four days after his visit to Providence, the first real replacement bill for Obamacare was introduced Monday. Was this the day these protesters were dreading, the day dreams of more equitable healthcare finally fell apart? Not really. But Democrats would do well to learn from the experience of Republicans — who were driven to the right by populist backlash during the Obama years — to ensure that their party does not suffer the same fate at the hands of ultra-liberal partisans.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is already clear that House Republicans’ Obamacare replacement, called the American Health Care Act, is far from a sweeping success and may already be dead in the water. Ryan has been assigned the near impossible task of securing majority support from the various factions of the Republican Party. To make matters worse, Republican groups like the <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/03/07/the_reviews_are_in_paul_ryan_s_obamacare_plan_makes_everyone_want_to_barf.html">Tea Party Patriots</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Heritage_Action/status/839149103330258945">Heritage Foundation</a> and House Libertarians have already come out against the American Health Care Act for not going far enough, effectively destroying the bill’s chances in the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, four Republican Senators — Sen. Rob Portman, R-OH, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-AK, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-WV, and Sen. Cory Gardner. R-CO — all have <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/03/07/the_reviews_are_in_paul_ryan_s_obamacare_plan_makes_everyone_want_to_barf.html">come out against</a> the American Health Care Act’s cuts to Medicaid, also preventing its passage in the Senate. Ultimately, what damned this bill is not Republican incompetence but rifts within the party. With Democrats well-positioned to retake seats in the coming midterm elections, organizers like those protesting in Providence must get to work now to prevent a Democratic majority from facing the same fate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The backlash to Trump’s presidency and Republican leadership has been visceral. In Rhode Island alone, protests have become regular occurrences, with <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170120/students-protesting-trump-march-to-rhode-island-state-house">two large</a> <a href="http://turnto10.com/news/local/second-anti-trump-rally-held-in-providence">anti-Trump protests</a> and a student walk out happening in the past couple of weeks. It is still unclear whether this wave of progressive energy really is a durable political movement or a reactionary movement that will eventually fade away. Still, protests like those against Ryan’s visit suggest that liberal activism could become a sustained force in American politics.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If backlash against Trump really is maintained, it will be hard to ignore the parallels between the rise of the power of the divisive Tea Party and the grassroots anti-Trump movements gaining steam now. The Tea Party emerged out of former President Barack Obama’s election, united by clear anti-Obama messages and hardcore conservatism. The movement maintained salience with effective organizing and voter mobilization, leading to the election of far-right representatives and the emergence of the Freedom Caucus — a coalition of Tea Party Republicans — on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The rise of anti-Trump protests have a similar history, and it is not fanciful to imagine that Democrats will nominate far-left progressives during the midterm elections. As the Democratic platform <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12281022/the-democratic-party-platform">moves further left</a>, seeing far-left progressive candidates take office will become increasingly normal. Whether this is a positive or negative trend remains to be seen. But it is important for Democrats to make sure that extreme progressives don’t hijack the party like the Freedom Caucus has hijacked the Republican Party. The Freedom Caucus is openly sympathetic with the values of the Tea Party, and the 29 members of the caucus have actively opposed the broader Republican Party’s agenda. Considering just 22 Republican defections in the House would sink any replacement plan — assuming Democrats don’t cross party lines — the Tea Party and Freedom Caucus essentially control the Republican Party.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An ultra-progressive caucus within the House seems like a dream to many progressive Democrats, but it is worth remembering that such a caucus could have prevented the passage of Obamacare on the grounds that it didn’t do enough. When Obamacare was first introduced in 2009, the option of single payer healthcare — a long-standing progressive dream — was sidelined. Progressive voices calling for a government-run healthcare system were shouted down. Had Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-VT, and a large coalition of progressive Democrats maintained that single payer insurance reform was the only way to garner their votes, federal health insurance reform would not have been implemented. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Assuming Republicans will eventually find success in their larger effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, Democrats should strive to maintain party unity as activists and protests become increasingly progressive. While Rhode Island’s Obamacare-sanctioned health insurance exchanges remain competitive and well-functioning compared to the rest of the country, one-third of American counties have only one insurer in what are supposed to be robustly competitive exchanges. Obamacare was not perfect, and if Democrats regain control of Congress and the presidency, they will need to rehash the healthcare debate once again. Having the same sorts of internal divisions that hamstrung their Republican counterparts will only make such considerations even more difficult.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Mar. 3, Deep Rai, a Sikh American of Indian origin was shot in a Seattle suburb by a white man who told him to “go back to your own country.” Less than two weeks earlier, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, Indian immigrants educated in the United States, were shot at a bar in Kansas by another white man, Adam Purinton. Kuchibhotla died of his injuries. As a half Indian American with a father who immigrated to the United States from India in the early 1980s and has since obtained American citizenship, I felt chills flash down my spine upon learning of these violent episodes. The sense of security I feel for my Indian-American family and friends — immigrants or natural-born citizens — has been undoubtedly corroded.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Indian Americans perfectly fit the description of a model minority. On average, they are well educated and affluent; they are doctors and engineers and entrepreneurs. As a result, it seems to me that many Indian Americans have been lulled into believing that they are immune to the racial tensions that define so much of American politics and history. Protected in their spacious suburban homes, it is easy to forget that they, too, are categorized as the “other” by the most racially, ethnically and religiously intolerant Americans. The recent outbreak of shootings should serve as a jolting reminder that a model minority is still a minority, subject to many of the hardships faced by other disadvantaged groups.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is not to say that all Indian Americans fail to integrate fully into society or are unwelcome in their communities — far from it. In fact, Kuchibhotla’s tragic story speaks to the multicultural reality that so many Indians who have recently arrived in the United States enjoy. According to the New York Times, Olathe, Kansas, the town in which Kuchibhotla worked, is “a hub of South Asian immigrants where 84 languages are spoken in the local school district.” Moreover, another patron of the bar where he and Madasani were relaxing offered to pay for their drinks after they were verbally attacked by Purinton. After three and a half decades in the South, including several years in small-town North Carolina, my own father would struggle to think of a single instance of discrimination against him.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The violence in Kansas and Seattle reveals that much work remains in the fight to stamp out intolerance, though. Lessons abound in the wake of these shootings (not the least of which is the need to address the gun violence epidemic plaguing the country). For Indian Americans in particular, there must be a concerted effort at solidarity with other minorities. Indeed, the members of the political group “Hindus for Trump” might look with suspicion at the Black Lives Matter movement or cling to Islamophobic prejudices rooted in India’s own religious conflicts. But it is hard to ignore the parallels between these shootings and white supremacist violence against African Americans, or the fact that they may have been motivated by the misguided belief that all people with brown skin are terrorists. Only by fighting to free African Americans, Muslims and other minorities from discrimination can Indian Americans ensure their own security in American society.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition, government officials and policymakers must reverse course on their strategy of exclusion. The latest executive order banning visitors and migrants from six Muslim-majority countries fuels the belief that only people of certain faiths, nationalities and ethnicities belong in the United States. This distorted vision of a country founded on “liberty and justice for all” will only make America less safe, especially for minorities like Indian Americans. The New York Times reported that “Mr. Purinton was arrested without incident … and invoked his constitutional rights.” Let us not forget the constitutional rights that Indian Americans enjoy, too, be they recent immigrants or natural-born citizens.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Work also remains for those Americans who embrace the diversity Indians offer. One of my Indian-American friends lamented on Facebook the remarkable lack of buzz surrounding the shootings, whether on social networks or in traditional media. It is not sufficient to support a multicultural society in theory without acting to defend it. For many Indian Americans, the past couple of weeks have been tinged with sadness, fear and even a sense of isolation in a country they call home. Reminding your Indian-American friends that you value their presence and will stand up for them, as basic as it may seem, could be a powerful gesture at this time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">During Presidents’ Day weekend, just days before the Kansas shooting, I visited my twin sister at Swarthmore College. On the day of my departure, I took the regional rail from Swarthmore into Philadelphia and was taken aback by a crowd of South Asian men and women waiting for the train. If I were to generalize, I would have guessed that many of them were immigrants working as engineers or information technology professionals in the city and making their home in the suburbs. I thought about the struggles they would experience and the successes they would celebrate in becoming a part of the American fabric. In light of recent events, that process may prove more difficult than I realized in the moment. Much room for optimism remains, though, as long as we refuse to grow complacent in the face of these shootings.</span></p>

		<title>Okin ’19: What’s in an Oscar legacy?</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/09/whats-in-a-legacy/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whether it was right for Casey Affleck — who has been charged with sexual assault on multiple occasions — to win the Oscar for best actor was initially obvious to me. Regardless of his performance in “Manchester by the Sea,” his criminal allegations should have penalized him from receiving the prestigious award. Yet in articulating my opinion to a friend the next day at lunch, I was caught off guard by her valid refute: “But when did the Academy Awards become a justice league?”
<p class="p2">Immediately, I was reminded of my paradoxical childhood obsession with Roald Dahl. On one hand, my favorite author had created the wondrous chocolate factory, given a little girl coveted mind powers and allowed giants to be kind. On the other hand, he was a raging anti-Semite. Yet I cannot help but look fondly on my time in the world of Dahl’s books, where I had some of my first experiences of feeling totally transported through literature. In conjuring some of my favorite childhood memories, I do not immediately think about his hatred for Jews. In fact, I don’t think about Dahl at all; instead, I think of Charlie Bucket, Miss Honey and the Big Friendly Giant.</p>
<p class="p2">Just as Dahl’s stories remain distinct in my mind from his personal convictions, an actor’s performance can remain separate from his individual integrity. When we interact with a piece of literature or film, we are primarily interacting with that work’s world and the characters who inhabit it — not with the human being behind the art. Thus, if the Oscars explicitly seeks to recognize cinematic achievements, there is nothing wrong about assessing Affleck’s portrayal of his character as worthy of such an award.</p>
<p class="p2">From here on out, Casey Affleck will always be identified as an “Oscar-winning” actor — in articles, on social media and when casually referenced in conversations. This is what bothers me most. Perhaps the issue on hand is not even a question of whether this label should have been earned in the first place, but where the status of “alleged assaulter” will stand in the actor’s legacy. Because, whereas the former is an esteemed modifier that Affleck will have the privilege of sporting for the rest of his life — and afterwards — the latter will most likely be camouflaged by the blinds of large professional achievement.</p>
<p class="p2">When we permit professional or intellectual accomplishments to supplant one’s history of alleged crimes, the message conveyed is that these transgressions are insignificant relative to one’s talent. Look at the most powerful man in the country: if the president is someone accused of sexual assault in the <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/10/all-the-women-accusing-trump-of-rape-sexual-assault.html">double digits</a>, there is no denying that we allow alleged assailants to rise up in society. But more so, maybe if more people had considered President Trump as a multiple-trangessor of sexual assault — at least as equally as they considered him a successful businessman — he would currently be enjoying fewer prestigious titles. More generally, this is how legacy functions: We choose certain primary labels to associate with people, and they stick. The others fade in time and are ultimately forgotten by the history books.</p>
<p class="p2">By determining one’s legacy overwhelmingly by their professional achievements, we perpetuate the idea that sexual assault — and other obstructions to human decency — is insignificant relative to one’s list of accomplishments. In encouraging the notion that one’s legacy is not tarnished as a consequence of assault, we fail to prevent future cases. In determining what goes down in history, we shape the present. Affleck shouldn’t be barricaded from winning the prestigious Academy Award, as the Oscars intend to solely consider theatrical ability, not moral character. Yet, members of society — who hold the power of determining how we remember people — should be able to recognize this: While awards shows may not consider morality, we can and should.</p>
<p class="p2">Among the career achievements, net-worth rankings and high IQs of powerful figures, we must include moral character in recalling their legacy. As students, our capacity to choose what issues to spotlight in our studies allows us the power of focusing our historical lens. In doing so, we can delve into the legacy of important figures with questionable backgrounds and spotlight the points of unease, instead of disguising it with the shield of professional success. This can involve writing the essay about a leader’s lesser-known relationships with his inferiors instead of describing the more obvious success of his lucrative empire. Or maybe it’s bringing the question of someone’s ethics to the seminar table before examining the triumph of their executive style. Only in altering how we expose the past can shape how society acts in the present and future.</p>

		<title>Smith GS: Building a community for graduate students</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last week, a fellow graduate student and I stopped at a food truck on Waterman Street to buy dinner after class. When I asked him where he wanted to sit and eat, he pointed up the block and said, “that building over there.” “You mean Faunce?” I asked. “Dude, I don’t know the names of these buildings,” he responded curtly.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A few days later, I recounted this story to another graduate student and asked what he thought about it. “I don’t know the names of most of the buildings on campus either,” he said. “My uncle went here as an undergraduate, and he always wants to talk about campus and reminisce. But I can’t have those conversations with him. I don’t even really feel like I go to Brown.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I feel similarly. As a graduate student, I do not feel a close connection to Brown. This feeling manifests itself in my day-to-day interaction with spaces on campus. I don’t know the names of most buildings, or what happens inside them. I don’t know where to find the dining halls, the theater spaces or the engineering building. If I venture off of the small number of pathways I take to and from class every day, I feel lost. Brown’s campus, as a whole, feels unfamiliar. At the (frequently occurring) moments when I feel physically out of place on campus, I also feel distant from the larger Brown community.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On the other hand, I do feel as though I am a part of a graduate student community that is distinct from the Brown community as a whole. Some might say that they don’t see a problem with this arrangement. Why not let the graduate students remain a separate community? The problem with this idea is that the graduate student community is small, strongly divided by department and comprised of students at a wide range of life stages. This means there is a too-high probability that individual graduate students will not be able to find a community amongst their peers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For example, a smaller department might accept a cohort of six graduate students in a given year. If two of those students are married, and one commutes from Boston (which is often the case), the other three have to hope that they like each other. If they don’t like each other, they will have to hope that they somehow get introduced to graduate students in other departments and be invited to socialize with them. For graduate students without a socially cohesive group of peers, finding a social circle is difficult. Not all graduate students are looking for a strong social network on campus, but some are — especially the younger graduate students, like myself, who are just one year out of undergraduate and are trying to make Brown a temporary home. For us, stronger ties to the larger university community would help to establish a sense of belonging and comfort on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I do not think that the feeling of separation between the graduate student community and the campus community as a whole is a problem that is specific to Brown ­— it is likely endemic to graduate studies. But I do think there are steps Brown can take to bridge the separation. Brown could, for example, host more graduate school-wide events, along the lines of the welcome speech at Graduate Student Orientation. It would provide a sense of community and belonging to see a large number of your peers assembled in the same space. Brown might also consider creating a cluster of graduate student housing, so that graduate students could have the option to live near each other, rather than being spread out <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/10/18/grad-students-lack-campus-housing-options/">randomly around town</a>. Brown could also create a peer-mentoring program where older graduate and undergraduate students volunteer to answer incoming graduate students’ questions and show them around campus. In graduate school, where independent reading, writing and research are paramount, community building should not be overlooked.</span></p>

		<title>Mitra ’18: Diversity in law starts at law school</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On Feb. 1, I woke up to euphoric news: For the first time in its 130-year history, the Harvard Law Review had elected a black woman <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/1/31/imeime-umana-law-review/">president</a>. Twenty-seven years after former President Barack Obama became the first black president of the prestigious student-run journal, law student ImeIme Umana made history. Over the next several weeks, as the news filtered through newspapers and newsfeeds, I saw many posts celebrating her election — with good reason.</p>
<p class="p2">The announcement came amidst a backdrop of improving diversity indicators in law schools across the country. In 2016, women outnumbered men in law school enrollment for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/business/dealbook/women-majority-of-us-law-students-first-time.html">first time</a>, making up a little over 50 percent of seats at juris doctorate programs. The Harvard Law Review, a feeder for some of the most powerful positions in the legal field, recently elected its <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/9/6/law-review-inducts-most-diverse-class/">most diverse class</a> of editors in its history. And just two weeks ago, Yale announced that law professor Heather Gerken would become the first female dean of its law school, which is currently ranked the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings">best in the country</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">But the truth isn’t nearly as rosy as some news organizations would have us believe. These isolated incidents mask the fact that law schools are still falling behind in many other indicators of diversity. For instance, while women earn 57 percent of undergraduate degrees, they only make up 51<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/business/dealbook/more-law-degrees-for-women-but-fewer-good-jobs.html"> percent of law school applicants</a>. Meanwhile, the percentage of African Americans and Hispanic Americans enrolled in law school actually <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/law_school_diversity_improves_but_not_at_most_prestigious_schools">decreased</a> between 2010 and 2013. And while the overall percentages of women and minorities in law schools may have risen over the last 10 years, they still lag behind at the most prestigious institutions. Doesn’t the very fact that it took 130 years for a black woman to become president of the Harvard Law Review say something about the system in itself?</p>
<p class="p2">Moreover, whatever improvements have been made in law school admissions have not translated to progress in future employment. A November 2016 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/business/dealbook/leading-new-york-law-firms-lag-women-and-minorities-diversity.html">report describes</a> how women hold less than 20 percent of partnerships at major law firms and 33 percent of federal district court <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/marketing/women/current_glance_statistics_january2017.authcheckdam.pdf">judgeships</a>. Even more alarmingly, African Americans accounted for just <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/market_research/lawyer-demographics-tables-2015.authcheckdam.pdf">5 percent </a>of practicing lawyers in 2010 — an absolutely ridiculous figure. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, law is one of the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/05/27/law-is-the-least-diverse-profession-in-the-nation-and-lawyers-arent-doing-enough-to-change-that/?utm_term=.cef1bf61f94e"> least diverse</a> professions in the country. More research is needed to truly evaluate diversity in the legal system (particularly from an intersectional perspective), but what we know points to a more sobering reality than recent New York Times headlines would suggest.</p>
<p class="p2">We have come a long way from the days when law schools and law firms consisted entirely of white men, but we shouldn’t let recent progress lull us into a sense of complacency. In the wake of national soul-searching around issues of bias in the criminal justice system, it is imperative that the legal profession become more diverse — a process that starts in the law schools.</p>
<p class="p2">An encouraging sign is that law schools are beginning to take some action. Just last week, Harvard Law School famously announced that it will no longer require LSAT scores and would accept GRE scores instead. This move will help to diversify the applicant pool, since the GRE examination is administered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/business/dealbook/harvard-law-will-accept-gre-scores.html">more frequently</a> and in more locations each year. Other top schools have also started to discuss changing the aid structure to reflect financial need rather than GPA and LSAT scores, shaking up an outdated system that currently favors middle-class <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/02/09/study-law-school-aid-likely-go-white-students">white candidates</a>. Yet there is much more to be done to make the law school process equitable for all.</p>
<p class="p2">We should definitely acknowledge the progress that has taken place over the last couple of decades and rejoice at moments like Umana’s election. As a minority woman who intends to go to law school someday, I for one have never been more excited to enter the field. But we should also remember that there is still a long road ahead.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">With CareerLAB strategically placed in the middle of campus and the name of a leading educational institution on our diplomas, most Brown graduates feel confident stepping out of the comfort of college and into the real world. Brown has consistently been successful in getting its students employed come graduation. But with all this working in our favor, this time of year is infamous for nervous students pacing around campus, weighing internship options and inevitably comparing themselves to others. During the high-stress season of job recruitment and exam stress, students fail to enjoy all that college life has to offer and forget to pat themselves on the back for their success thus far. Instead, we set our sights on the next destination: quick and groundbreaking success, without taking the time to realize that success comes in many forms and follows many timelines.</p>
<p class="p3">Come recruitment season, lecture halls are packed with sharply dressed and ambitious Brown students hoping to secure a summer internship or job. Brown is known to attract the top names in the business — from McKinsey to Goldman Sachs — <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/09/30/brown-grads-flock-to-top-companies/">allowing students to aim high</a> in their post-graduation careers. Looking from afar, these lecture halls look like trailers for life at an Ivy League — young adults dressed in Brooks Brothers with the twinkle of a bright future in their eyes. But when you step back, you realize the hall is filled with 20-something year olds with little idea of what they’ll end up pursuing and doubts about whether they’ll make the cut. And the truth is, with only a couple spots up for grabs, most students in the hall won’t.</p>
<p class="p3">Brown has a reputation of being one of the most laid-back Ivy League schools. We’re supportive of each other, we hate cutthroat competition and we value our passions over our wallets. Right? As much as Brown lives up to its supportive reputation, recruitment season jumps out as being the most fidgety, high-strung of the year. With job slots up for grabs, we can’t help but be competitors and compare ourselves to others. A feeling of inadequacy becomes commonplace on campus.</p>
<p class="p3">So why do we have it in our heads that to win the game of employment, we have to secure the best jobs at top companies? Why don’t we spend more time appreciating how far we’ve come as students and counting our blessings? This phenomenon isn’t limited to Brown by any stretch of the imagination, and it may not even be unique to our generation. The threshold between education and employment is inevitably paved with doubt and insecurity. We all feel like sharply dressed kids auditioning for grown-up roles at some point. The transition isn’t supposed to be easy — if it were, success stories wouldn’t be nearly as inspiring. But our drive to excel can get dangerous when we become so obsessed that a brighter, more profitable future clouds our ability to enjoy the present.</p>
<p class="p3">In a TED Talk, Harvard graduate Shawn Achor argues that, during a visit to his alma mater, he didn’t notice the level of happiness among students that he was expecting. Jittery students failed to live in the now — they focused on working themselves to the bone in hopes of being happy in the future with their shiny careers and professionally-furnished apartments. But we’ve worked hard to get here. What’s the point if we don’t let ourselves enjoy our time in college?</p>
<p class="p3">Don’t get me wrong: I’m not arguing that looking to the future and working hard is a problem. But if we take a step back, we’ll notice we’re expecting a lot from grads in their early twenties. We’re being incredibly hard on ourselves for no real reason: We’ve made it this far, and falling once in a while is exactly what’s supposed to happen. Not starting from the top doesn’t mean we won’t get there. In fact, the climb might be the most rewarding part of our careers. Comparing our GPAs, resumes and internship opportunities to our neighbors doesn’t help anyone — it diminishes our happiness and keeps us from enjoying the institution we worked so hard to be admitted into.</p>
<p class="p3">Instead of looking at Brown’s reputation for ushering its graduates into employment as a source of comfort, many take it as a pressure to meet certain standards. Instead of grinning at the names of recent Brown graduates in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list, many students worry they won’t reach that level of success in under ten years. The point is, your career path will inevitably be different from your peers and past Brown graduates. Becoming inspired and impassioned by looking at other’s achievements is what college is all about, but incessantly comparing yourself to others will inevitably lead to a feeling of disappointment. There will always be a child prodigy or overnight success that will make you feel a tinge of jealousy unless you decide, right here and now, not to live in someone’s shadow and instead commit to enjoying the power of now.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hamilton: An American Musical is, without a doubt, among the 21st century’s most popular pieces of art. Since its Broadway debut in 2015, the musical has been on the receiving end of relentless adulation. Much of this acclaim has to do with Hamilton’s unconventional commitment to Americans left on the margins­ — actors of color play the roles of America’s white, slave-owning founding fathers, and the genre of hip-hop is deftly wielded as an instrument of history. In this way, the musical resonantly transposes the reality of racial marginalization onto the most primordial story of the American experience: “young, scrappy” people, freshly emancipated from tyranny, who dare to arrange their own form of government, create their own nation and, ultimately, seek out their own fortune. As theater critic Ben Brantley wrote in the New York Times, “‘Hamilton makes us feel the unstoppable, urgent rhythm of a nation being born.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But Hamilton isn’t perfect. Nor, I feel, is it deserving of the sorts of unanimous, uncritical praise that progressive urbanites have hyperactively heaped upon it in the past two years. After all, beneath the musical’s inventive lyrics and feel-good narratives lies a more unsettling truth: Hamilton is less an adroit riposte to injustice as much as it is an accommodation of it — three hours of ahistorical propaganda, faux racial redress and sugarcoated struggle meant only to alleviate the moral discomfort of the haves, without doing very much for have-nots. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For one, it doesn’t take years of research to relieve Hamilton of its historical embellishments. The musical portrays Alexander Hamilton, the country’s first Secretary of the Treasury, as a “young, scrappy and hungry” immigrant and consummate republican who exhibits an intimate understanding of the struggles of ordinary folk. But such a depiction is nowhere close to the truth. <a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=11&amp;psid=3799">Hamilton once told</a> the Constitutional Convention that “the mass of the people … seldom judge or determine right” and that society’s most privileged ought to have a “distinct, permanent share in government.” A few years later, Hamilton vigorously supported the<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1405146"> Alien and Sedition Acts</a> — specifically the articles that permitted the immediate deportation of immigrants and suppression of anti-Federalist dissent. Alexander Hamilton is scarcely the paragon of democratic forbearance that Hamilton fans want him to be.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Then there’s the more serious problem of who actually gets to see Hamilton. Premium seats at Richard Rodgers Theater, the Broadway theater which houses the production, cost $849; the remaining thousand or so seats cost around $200. And, thanks to scalpers, who resell nearly a quarter of Hamilton tickets, resale of the tickets can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/theater/hamilton-inc-the-path-to-a-billion-dollar-show.html?smid=pl-share">exceed $5,000</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These exorbitant rates are prohibitive; the only people who can actually afford to see revolutionary Americans spit anti-colonial fire are the affluent — <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/03/08/469539715/a-brown-hamilton-a-white-audience">mostly white, well-educated and sympathetic</a> to the progressive cause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Close to four-fifths of Broadway audiences are white, so Hamilton’s monochromatic viewership isn’t exactly the fault of its producers. But, for a musical whose primary selling point is the spirited preservation of marginalized perspectives, what good does it do to cast black and Hispanic actors as white guys if black and Hispanic people don’t get to see it? It is wonderful that white people are able to see talented dramatists of diverse backgrounds excel, but the essential thrust of Hamilton — that black and brown Americans are nonnegotiably integral to American history — will never fully resonate with them. Indeed, as one essayist at <a href="http://howlround.com/why-hamilton-is-not-the-revolution-you-think-it-is">HowlRound</a> — the online theater journal — observes, it is not difficult to imagine that many white viewers “walk away from Hamilton thinking that they are on the right side of history simply because they exchanged hundreds of dollars for the opportunity to sit through a racialized song and dance.” For me, Hamilton feels more like an excuse for progressives to recuse themselves from the demands of progressivism, from the task of squarely confronting historical injustice. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Just as significantly, the musical’s central premise — that representation in casting somehow makes the prejudice that undergirded the founding of America more palatable, even excusable — is disappointing. That Hamilton boasts a cast of color is commendable; that its cast must incarnate the roles of wealthy whites, and ultimately tell a white story, is substantially less meaningful. At the end of the day, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette — all utterly indispensable to American independence — are still white, and actors of color, no matter how phenomenal, cannot change that. If anything, Hamilton simply reaffirms what we already know: At the inception of our republic, white people called the shots.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the end, it’s this ineluctable whiteness that also cheapens the significance of Alexander Hamilton’s immigrant credentials, upon which the musical places appreciable emphasis. It is true that Hamilton did not belong to the hierarchy of colonial privilege; he was a self-made man who, like most immigrants, started with nothing. The musical recounts his early years as an orphan in the British West Indies, his service in the Continental Army as George Washington’s aide-de-camp and his eventual emergence as one of the country’s most influential founders. Perhaps the most famous lyric in the musical is Hamilton’s and Lafayette’s simultaneous declaration, “Immigrants: We get the job done!” Yet, while Hamilton tries very hard to tacitly rebuke xenophobia, it must be noted that he wasn’t any old immigrant. He was white, he spoke English and he was educated at an Ivy League university. In other words, he had everything going for him. As such, Hamilton — in all his gilded refinement and contempt for democracy — doesn’t represent the value of immigration as much as he does the importance of servicing the agenda of the elite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m not trying to discredit the inimitable talents of Lin-Manuel Miranda or his co-stars. As a piece of entertainment, Hamilton is unparalleled. In a time when social media can capriciously propel cultural phenomena to popularity and condemn them to obsolescence, the show’s songs and storyline have wielded extraordinary staying power. But it is the transmogrification of Hamilton — from Broadway musical to some sort of salvific opus, at least in the eyes of young liberals — that really bothers me. Sure, Hamilton is wildly entertaining; sure, it has reinvigorated interest in early American history. But to pretend that it does anything more — that it makes a contribution to the project of interracial understanding or even effectively asserts the indispensability of Americans of color — is baselessly wishful.</span></p>

		<title>Blasberg ’18: Firing Julien sparks flame</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Feb. 7, the Boston Bruins fired Head Coach Claude Julien halfway into his tenth season at the helm. Players and fans were shocked and saddened as the skipper that brought Boston its first Stanley Cup in 39 years packed his bags. Julien emerged a hometown favorite as his arrival lifted the Bruins from nearly two decades of mediocrity. The team won the cup in 2011 and made another run to the Finals in 2012. His arrival brought the Bruins back into relevancy in Boston, but after two consecutive seasons of missing the playoffs and a half season of just over .500 hockey, the Bruins’ front office decided it was time to mix things up. Since hiring Bruce Cassidy as head coach, the Bruins are 12-3-0 and playing exciting, offensive hockey in the hopes of locking down a playoff bid.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The firing caught many players by surprise, but to fans and onlookers, the move did not come out of the blue. His defense-first mantra had become less effective as the Bruins’ best defensemen grew old or left. To accentuate their defensive issues, the Bruins lacked a variety of offensive assets who could put the puck in the net. A typical Bruins game at the end of Julien’s tenure generally featured the Bruins dominating puck time but failing to score, while defensive miscues would lead to fluke goals for the opposing team. The front office got rid of Julien to spark the squad as well as a desire for a different coaching mentality.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Bruins, though, are in good company. Last season, the Pittsburgh Penguins were disappointed with a 15-10-3 start to the season and fired their head coach Mike Johnston. This change was a major catalyst for the Penguins, as they went on to finish with the second most points in the Eastern Conference en route to a Stanley Cup title.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Midseason coaching changes are high-risk, high-reward, but they often cause the affected players to play with more urgency and passion. The Red Sox’ 2015 campaign saw John Farrell miss the last month and a half of the season for chemotherapy treatment. Torey Lovullo stepped in as interim manager, and the team instantly responded, finishing the season with particularly inspired baseball highlighted by its two longest-winning streaks of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Right now, the Bruins are playing with the Penguins’ urgency and the Sox’ emotional grip. The players had an especially close relationship with Julien, and many have stated that he has been in their minds during the second half of the season. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The team’s recent results show a major difference between pre- and post-Julien hockey: offensive production. Since Cassidy took over Feb. 9, the Bruins have netted four or more goals ten times. It took the Bruins four and a half months to do so 14 times under Julien. Both Brad Marchand and David Pastrnak have emerged as serious goal-scoring threats.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Bruins recent winning habits have gone a long way in solidifying its playoff spot. For most of the season, the team was either on the playoff bubble or on the outside looking in. Now, they have a five-point cushion over the Tampa Bay Lightning for the third bid from the Atlantic Division. The nature of hockey makes any playoff series competitive, so if the Bruins enter the playoffs as hot as they are now, they have a good chance of upsetting a higher-seeded team.</span></p>

		<title>Schapiro ’19: The designated hitter is overdue for retirement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is perhaps no subject that divides baseball fans more sharply than the existence of the designated hitter. Since 1973 when the idea was first implemented, it has created a bitter divide between supporters and critics. But while each side of the debate is loud, they are not equally compelling. The DH should never have been introduced, and now that it does exist, it should disappear as quickly as possible — or, at least, should never expand beyond its current existence.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Supporters of the DH have various arguments, which boil down to two main themes: pitcher safety and the flow of the game. The pitcher safety argument says that pitchers should not hit<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— or run the bases — because they traditionally devote little or no practice time to offensive skills, which increases the risk of injury when pitchers attempt to do so. The other argument invokes game movement and excitement: it’s simply not fun, supporters will claim, to watch the pitcher strike out every time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Both arguments come down to the same basic principle: Because pitchers are not good enough — or safe enough, experienced enough, etc. — to hit major league pitching, they should not have to. Pitchers, in short, should not hit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The problem with this argument should be immediately clear. It’s not an argument about pitchers, but one about bad hitters, regardless of position. There is no reason any of the arguments given could not apply equally to a left fielder who hits as poorly as a pitcher. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Take the argument of pitcher safety. Supporters of the DH will argue that it should only apply to pitchers because they face a greater risk of injury than better hitters. This is true, but so what? All players face certain injury risks when they hit; why not let the defenders work on defense, and replace them on offense with players who train exclusively for hitting and running, and thus have smaller risks of injury? If injury risk is accepted as a valid reason to exempt a player from hitting — as it is by DH supporters — it should extend to all players. And clearly, no one wants that to happen.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Other supporters of the DH will claim that pitchers, on average, are by far the worst hitters in baseball. This is undoubtedly true, but it does not solve the problem. Anyone who advocates using the DH is advocating allowing players not to hit because they are not good enough. There is no logical reason that this should be restricted to the worst hitters in the game; indeed, anyone who truly believes in the DH should believe that the same system can be applied to every player in the game. Any argument for the DH carried to its logical conclusion will suggest that no player should be forced to play both offense and defense — a conclusion that is simply ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">All arguments for the DH face the same problem. Any player that plays the field must devote time to learning defense, which means less time to spend becoming a better hitter. Logically speaking, if one supports this argument for the DH, why not have separate players for offense and defense? The defensive players could spend all day doing fielding drills, and the offensive players could spend every waking hour in the batting cages. Better offense, better defense — problems solved! We made the game more exciting and cut down on risk of injury due to inexperience! How could this ever be wrong?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Baseball traditionalists, of course, will recognize immediately why this is wrong: it is not how baseball works. Baseball players must play offense, and they must play defense. That’s the sport. Even supporters of the DH, it seems, would agree almost unanimously that having two separate lineups for offense and defense would be a bad thing. But they can’t make that case with any legitimacy; By supporting the DH, they’re actually contradicting themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Many people are unaware of the history of the DH. It was introduced to help the American League compete with the National League for fans, sponsors and money. While the idea had been debated since the early 1900s, it wasn’t adopted by the American League until 1973, after heavy lobbying from Charlie Finley, eccentric owner of the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Somehow, it’s fitting. Besides the DH, Charlie Finley’s other groundbreaking innovations include gold uniforms, orange baseballs and an air jet that brushed home plate automatically. To increase ticket sales and turn his team into a national spectacle, he gave his players nicknames and had them grow mustaches. In Kansas City, he installed a mechanical rabbit to deliver baseballs to the umpires. Besides all this, throughout nearly his entire tenure as owner of the A’s, Charlie Finley was almost universally reviled. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sure, it’s fun to watch giant, hulking men blast home runs, and less fun to watch a pitcher strike out without having much of a chance. But that’s baseball. You field, and then you hit, whether you can hit or not. The designated hitter should go the way of mechanical rabbits and gold uniforms and become a failed relic of history.</span></p>

		<title>Steinman ’19: Free speech is not the problem on campuses</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/16/steinman-19-free-speech-not-problem-campuses/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">The debate over free speech on college campuses and in academia fits into a neat, tightly woven narrative that goes something like this: Rather than inherit the mantle of their student-activist predecessors, the free speech advocates of the 1960s, college students today choose to remain in their safe spaces and repress viewpoints counter to their own. This characterization is enormously misleading. Yet it seems to have been taken up by those on the left who may have been a part of those original student movements, as well as by those on the right who probably view those movements far more favorably now than they might have at the time.</p>
<p class="p3">Middlebury College, a small liberal arts school in Vermont, is ground zero for the debate this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/opinion/discord-at-middlebury-students-on-the-anti-murray-protests.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=EndOfArticle&amp;pgtype=article">month</a>. The American Enterprise Institute’s chapter there, with a cosponsorship from the political science department, invited Charles Murray, a conservative sociologist and author, to give a talk. Murray is the author of a 1994 book, “The Bell Curve,” which posited that differences in IQ among races were genetic and were to blame for social problems like crime and poverty, a claim that was emphatically debunked over 20 years ago. The last time he spoke at Middlebury eight years ago, Murray “insulted the black students in the audience, telling them they would be better off going to a state university rather than being over their heads at an ‘elite’ institution that they did not really earn the right to attend,” Middlebury Associate Professor of Sociology Linus Owens wrote in a piece on <a href="https://medium.com/@linusvanpelt/coming-together-and-coming-apart-5fc26d9233ed#.uu28go86f">Medium</a>. This time around, as was widely documented by the national press, student protesters shut down the planned public lecture and attempted to disrupt a private webcast frantically arranged as a replacement. Once the webcast concluded, a confrontation occurred between the protesters and Murray, who was accompanied by Middlebury Professor of Political Science Allison Stanger. In the ensuing violence, Stanger suffered a neck injury and eventually was diagnosed with a concussion. Obviously, violence of this kind is deplorable in its own right and pulls the nation’s attention away from the message of the protest. The validity of protesting Murray was twisted and lost; coming so soon after a similar protest at the University of California at Berkeley, the events at Middlebury were easily shaped to fit the narrative that college students are too emotionally sensitive to handle even mildly dissenting viewpoints.</p>
<p class="p3">Almost exactly a year ago, I wrote a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/07/the-echo-chamber-all-we-have-in-common/">column</a> expressing my fear that echo chambers — the widening gap between the news and opinions that people on each side of the political spectrum are exposed to — were eroding not just our political discourse but also our sense of reality. It’s been a year of alternative facts, fake news and a wider spread of hateful rhetoric than I could have imagined in March 2016. The murmured dissent in President Trump supporters’ echo chambers a year ago, unheard by the rest of us, is now in White House press reports and on CNN. There is no more hiding — which is why I don’t understand the oft-repeated maxim, particularly in recent months, that today’s college students are coddled. The pejorative descriptor is generally applied to us in articles and columns about the on-campus spread of trigger warnings, safe spaces, checking one’s privilege and other omens of the imminent destruction of free speech everywhere. Something is obviously wrong. Political dialogue in America is acutely, if not terminally, ill. But free speech, the availability of platforms to spread any and all ideas, regardless of merit, ideology or highbrow magnitude, has never been freer. Ideas — well-formulated and ignorant, hateful and kind — are being shared faster and wider than ever before. Free speech and expression in the 1960s was truly threatened, thanks to a limited number of news outlets and a repressive political climate. But that is no longer the case. Far from being coddled, today’s students are spending their intellectually formative years being exposed to the most extreme rhetoric — from all sides of the political spectrum — ever espoused in American politics.</p>
<p class="p3">For immigrants, Muslims, women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people and any number of other marginalized groups, engaging with news is not an impersonal activity. The average person today spends eight hours a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/technology/trump-news-media-ignore.html?_r=0">day</a> consuming media, and I imagine that figure is considerably higher for Americans. These eight hours are filled with messages from the most powerful platform in the nation, and perhaps in the world — the White House — telling them that they are subhuman. There is no discourse to be had there, no lofty, idealistic, objective exchange of ideas. And while it’s true that the First Amendment doesn’t specify that speech has to be good to be free, it also doesn’t specify that all speech deserves the legitimacy of a college podium and an introduction from a university president, as was the case at Middlebury. Listening to a speaker tell my classmates of color that they don’t belong here doesn’t make me more of an intellectual or introduce me to “bold inquiry and fearless debate,” as Frank Bruni yearned for in a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/opinion/sunday/the-dangerous-safety-of-college.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Ffrank-bruni&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0">column</a> this week.</p>
<p class="p3">Inquiry and debate are surely needed. Conservative speakers are invited to speak on campuses every day, and their talks generally go off without a hitch. Just last week here at Brown, two Republican political analysts, a Fox News contributor and a former advisor to Sen. John McCain, R-AZ, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/07/react-symposium-kicks-off-brown-arts-initiative-2/">discussed the future</a> of the Republican Party with the Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones. This evidently peaceful event was not picked up by any national news outlets, and I would imagine most panels and guest lectures hosted daily at American colleges and universities follow a similar pattern. We students confront dissenting and, yes, offensive ideas every day and react to them privately and publicly — probably more often than adults do. But when the decision comes to defend the humanity and worth of our marginalized classmates or to yield passively to the erosion of decency and acceptance, it is strikingly obvious which path is the bold and fearless one.</p>
<p class="p3">In their editorial covering the events at Middlebury, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/opinion/smothering-speech-at-middlebury.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=EndOfArticle&amp;pgtype=article">opened</a> with the same John Stuart Mill quote a student used to introduce Murray regarding all dissenters, “Truth would lose something by their silence.” In this age, with so much at risk, the world would lose something by ours.</p>

		<title>Liang ’19: Trump’s NIH cuts will harm undergraduate research</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do you do research on campus? Would you like to do research on campus? Congratulations — it just got a bit harder.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have a lot of complaints about President Trump’s new budget. For the sake of perspective, let’s skip the cuts to Sesame Street, NASA’s Office of Education, the Environmental Protection Agency, Health and Human Services and the National Endowment for the Arts, among many others. This column would be too long with cries of dismay, and I’m sure there’s no point in hammering the same ideas to the many liberals on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For now, let’s talk about the National Institutes of Health.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The NIH provides grants to thousands of institutions nationwide to support biomedical research, and it also runs the largest basic science research center in the world from its headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland. The current budget plan <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trumps-budget-would-slash-scientific-and-medical-research/2017/03/15/d3261f98-0998-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?utm_term=.d07588900db5">cuts nearly 20 percent</a> of the NIH’s $30 billion annual budget, specifically slashing all funding for the Fogarty International Center, which is <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/health/global-health-fogarty-international-center-viruses.html?_r=0&amp;referer=https://www.google.com/">designed to build relationships</a> between health research facilities in the United States and abroad. Apparently “America First” doesn’t consider the fact that we could learn something from other countries. Even scarier are the nonspecific uses of “reform” and “major reorganization” used when discussing the new budget. Trump’s policies have been volatile and unpredictable in the past ­— and now a major established (and overall successful) research institution is at risk.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s important to consider the conservative response to these kinds of cuts; many believe that the state should have no role in fields that could become politicized, science and education included. It’s a reasonable defense — no one wants television turned into propaganda or controversial science abused. And new technologies like genetic modification or stem cells merit new bioethical discussions regarding the use of public funds. But basic science (we’re talking pipettes, cell plates and centrifuging) funded by the NIH has traditionally received bipartisan support for developing health innovation since its founding in 1870 to fight epidemics of cholera and yellow fever. Now we’ve seen the respect the Oval Office has for scientific research, or the lack thereof.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trump’s “America First” policy may look good on paper for some who are concerned about ballooning government spending, but the effects of these cuts to science and health innovation will reverberate for a very long time, regardless of the political party in control. The United States risks losing ground both in scientific talent and infrastructure; coupled with tighter immigration and overall defunding, the nature of research universities and other institutions is already changing for the worse. Over 80 Nobel prizes have been awarded to NIH-funded researchers, but this science took decades of sustained funding. Imagine how four years of interrupted, decreased support will affect research in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This country’s higher education is built on the concept of the collegiate research university; Trump’s<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/trump-budget-cuts-science/519825/"> cuts to the NIH </a>will trickle down at every level. Journalists are already predicting a “lost generation in American research” if these cuts are enacted. Our current college population will be that generation. The NIH funds grants that support students who don’t get Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award funding for their summer research in Providence. During the last fiscal year alone, <a href="https://report.nih.gov/award/index.cfm?ot=&amp;fy=2016&amp;state=&amp;ic=&amp;fm=&amp;orgid=1003201&amp;distr=&amp;rfa=&amp;om=n&amp;pid=#tab2">Brown was awarded 187 NIH grants</a> totaling $74,222,324, including funding for the lab I work in. Losing the proposed 20 percent of those funds would have dramatic effects here at Brown; now think of all the smaller recipients who can’t replace that deficit with private funding. We’re the (relatively) lucky ones.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These issues are indicative of a larger problem that seems to be gripping many people distrusting of the “deep state,” and of government in general. Our current administration is expecting the impossible: American exceptionalism without support for any nonmilitary program that could shape it. With a wall to keep out the next generation of scientists who immigrate here and research programs without funding, does this country really believe it can continue its cultural and scientific dominance? Private funding may allow biomedical research in this country to continue to progress. But we shouldn’t have to rely on the generosity of the Zuckerbergs or the Gates family to ensure continued, sustained health research in the United States, especially for smaller institutions that are overlooked by large, private financiers. We shouldn’t have to argue for every dollar that, in the long run, will prevent outbreaks and support economic, social and technological prosperity. We shouldn’t have to deal with this nonsense.</span></p>

		<title>Miller &#039;19: Thayer Street — A fond memory</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Thayer Street was once a mecca for distinctive family-owned businesses, catering to the needs and tastes of the students and residents of College Hill. Turn-of-the-century clapboard homes painted in bright colors stocked clothes from the far corners of the world, while the aromas from immigrant-owned restaurants competed for the opportunity to broaden the palates of students from here, there and everywhere. How many of those students would see their first Dashiki or taste souvlaki for the first time while at college? Thayer Street represented the quintessential college mercantile community, a place to learn and enjoy new and different experiences.</p>
<p class="p2">But demographics of businesses across the United States have changed. Where a corner pizza shop once thrived, a Dominos now sits; that wonderful old sub shop has become a Subway. The distinctive boutique that sold the trendiest British “originals” is now a Lulu Lemon. And so it goes on Thayer. The colorful make-up on the street-faces of those Victorian dames can no longer hide their age. Empty buildings and closing signs mix uncomfortably with the ersatz stucco bearing the logos of all-too-familiar chains.</p>
<p class="p2">I am not in any way disparaging these recognizable names: Chipotle, Johnny Rockets and Starbucks create an enclave of Providence dining choices for even the pickiest of palates. And who could argue that the variety and prices at a CVS store are better than they were at the old E. P. Anthony’s Apothecary? The corpse of that store, which once offered handmade chocolates scooped from handsome glass-covered walnut display cases, is now buried under the Chipotle at the corner of Angell Street and Thayer. These replications of stores, from Peoria to Phoenix, come at great cost to the culture of Thayer and its local businesses. And the trend continues: Even some of the most recognizable names are being cannibalized to make way for “trendier” versions of the same ilk. Gone is Au Bon Pain, a chain too-often associated with airports and hospitals, and the late-night staple Nice Slice <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/15/nice-slice-close-thayer-street-location/">will soon meet the same fate</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">One need only look at the periphery of Harvard Square to recognize an unfortunate truth: It would be naive to think that Thayer would buck a nationwide trend. The economics of retail mercantilism pull too strongly from the mom and pop ideals of yesterday. Chain stores are not only more capable of paying higher rent as highly credit-rated tenants, but their leases also allow building owners to borrow more against their property. This “leverage” permits the owners to expand their holdings and acquire more property. As they say, “He who pays the piper calls the tune.”</p>
<p class="p2">In exchange for paying the bills, the chains require uniformity in their locations. To develop and maintain their “goodwill,” stores must be easily recognizable, and thus their store exteriors, interior layout and decor must conform to a prototype. The same is true for the food and merchandise sold. While conformity may lead to brand recognition or assure a certain level of quality, it may not blend with the characteristic individuality of Thayer.</p>
<p class="p2">The changing demographics of Thayer go beyond restaurants and clothing stores. In 2013, nine once-gracious houses <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/02/28/city-approves-thayer-apartments/">were demolished</a> to make way for a square, unadorned brick edifice developed by a family of Brown alums who saw a more efficient use for the land. But while these luxury apartments at 257 Thayer may improve living arrangements for some, their location — commandeering a single lot from Thayer — has left an entire block of the street with a movie-set façade. Yes, this building is sleeker and far from an eye-sore. But one can’t help but wonder when the movie set too will be taken down in the name of the gentrification of Thayer Street.</p>
<p class="p2">As Brown students and Providence residents for at least a few years, we must be mindful of the changing state of Thayer and its repercussions on us, Providence and its residents. Must Thayer Street conform? Must you conform to these changes? Once the eccentric texture of Thayer is gone, it will not be recreated — ever. Its quintessential college environment will be lost to growing consumer metropolitanism, looking identical to cookie-cutter establishments in thousands of cities. Shouldn’t we try to keep Thayer one of a kind?</p>
<p class="p2">So next time you want to get a burrito, a cup of coffee or a shirt, think about shopping at a local store, preferably one that has not torn apart an older building and replaced it with the universal visions of far-off corporate design teams. Thayer should not be lost to the whims of consumerism or become the ghost of a disappearing past. Let’s all do our best to keep Thayer Street the site of some of our fondest and most unique memories at Brown.</p>

		<title>Friedman &#039;19: Nice Slice — death by parking meter</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/21/friedman-19-nice-slice-death-parking-meter/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nice Slice <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/15/nice-slice-close-thayer-street-location/">announced</a> Wednesday that it will be closing its Thayer Street location April 15. The news was disappointing for me, in part because I have many fond memories of late weekend nights spent at Nice Slice. I am still coming to terms with the fact that members of the class of 2021 will probably never know that Nice Slice ever existed, despite the fact that I spent most of my Saturday nights last year on the concrete steps outside their door, eating pizza with friends from my freshman unit. But what is more disappointing to me than my newfound nostalgia is the fact that the reasons for its closing were so predictable and so preventable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Herald article reporting on Nice Slice’s closing cites a raise in property price and the addition of parking meters on Thayer Street <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/15/nice-slice-close-thayer-street-location/">as the major forces</a> behind the move. About the parking meters, Nice Slice owner Al Read said, “We’ve never recovered from this construction project. Our business has declined over the past five years.” Other Thayer Street businesses have expressed similar concerns: in a recent Providence Journal article, Avon Cinema’s owner <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160906/on-thayer-street-in-providence-is-citys-busiest-parking-meter">claimed that</a> “anti-business” parking meters are “driving away customers and destroying small businesses” on Thayer Street and that “the situation continues to deteriorate.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thayer Street parking meters arrived in late 2015, around the same time that the Thayer Street District Management Authority (effectively a Thayer Street chamber of commerce sponsored by the Providence Department of Planning &amp; Development) began <a href="http://www.thayerstreetdistrict.com/who-we-are--what-we-do.html">improving the street’s sidewalks</a> and installed BigBelly solar trash compactors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mayor Jorge Elorza proposed parking meters as a way to cover a 2 percent year-over-year spending increase in his 2015 budget proposal <a href="http://ripr.org/post/elorza-unveils-696-million-budget-proposal-fee-hikes-notax-increases">without increasing “broad-based” taxes</a>. While the TSDMA’s urban design-based improvements to Thayer Street were well-received, Elorza’s parking meters were, and remain, despised. The Providence Journal even <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/opinion/20160313/kim-clark-elorza-kills-businesses-with-parking-meters">pronounced</a> that Elorza “killed businesses with parking meters.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many Thayer Street businesses — including Nice Slice — created and signed a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/city-of-providence-remove-parking-meters-from-thayer-street-district-now-2">petition</a>, deftly titled “Remove Parking Meters From Thayer Street District — NOW!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The parking meters were so poorly received that Elorza temporarily nullified his own measure, <a href="http://turnto10.com/news/local/parking-meters-in-providence-will-be-free-throughout-the-year">offering free parking at metered spaces</a> across the city from the end of November to December last year. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Parking meters — like Thayer’s CALTHA53, which generated $37,100 in revenue last year — were implemented as a solution to “free up parking space(s) for new customers” while bolstering the city’s tax base. But the loss of the social capital that local businesses bring to College Hill is certainly not worth the arguably insignificant extra dollars in tax revenue, especially when the city’s approved operating budget <a href="http://openbudget.providenceri.gov/#!/year/default">is sitting at a healthy</a> $717.95 million, up $23 million from two years ago. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Parking meters have inevitably led to the demise of a number of Thayer Street restaurants, including SnoTea Café and Skewers, with Nice Slice being the latest victim. Generally this has been followed by consolidation by competing businesses, like Baja’s opening Baja’s Taqueria in Skewer’s former location. Often the companies that move in are national chains: Kung Fu Tea (which boasts 107 locations nationwide) moved into SnoTea Café’s former store. We will witness by CHLOE, a Manhattan chain, move into a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/28/chloe-open-223-thayer/">space vacated by</a> Au Bon Pain in just a few months. Often, these chains do well precisely because they aren’t local. As Read said, “They come in and they pose as being local and independent-minded, but they’ve got big advertising budgets, and it’s hard to compete with that.” As a local business, it’s especially hard to compete with national chains in a market plagued by parking meters and greedy landlords.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Considering the success of other chains on Thayer Street — Starbucks, Chipotle, most recently Insomnia Cookies — I have no doubt that another national chain will swiftly fill the void left by Nice Slice’s departure. But the Brown community will be the worse for it. National chains make Thayer Street look more like a bland, interchangeable suburban intersection than a legitimate college commercial district.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Elorza, by tactlessly skewing the market in their favor, is giving chains a leg up. I can only hope that Brown students have the moral conscience to nullify his mistakes, but so far, we have been patronizing stores and restaurants in accordance with the size of their advertising budgets. And that just put Nice Slice out of business.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the weather warms, we will soon begin to see the Main Green fill with students, eager to relax for a short spell before a class or a meeting. On particularly nice or free days, some will undoubtedly stay outside for hours, shirking work in favor of some much-needed relaxation. While students will no doubt be excited for the warm weather, another factor is key to the popularity of the Main Green as well: Brown has no passable indoor space for recreation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This space should, of course, be available in the Stephen Roberts ’62 Campus Center — or as any student knows it, Faunce. At most universities, the campus center is primarily a social or recreational space, holding eateries, game rooms and more. Of course, on the face of it, Faunce contains all of these things: Between the Blue Room and the basement, those boxes are technically checked. And yet rarely, if ever, does it seem that Faunce provides a space for socialization. The Blue Room is filled with meetings of student groups seemingly unaware that J. Walter Wilson is merely 100 or so feet away. The basement contains students eating, generally miffed at being forced underground by the executive boards hoarding the Blue Room. And Leung Family Gallery? Forget about it. Leung is hardly welcoming to someone with a bit of a cough, let alone to friends wishing to catch up or take a break from their busy schedules. It’s Leung, in fact, that seems to ruin Faunce from the top down: The addition of a deathly quiet study space to the building certainly doesn’t promote its use for carefree relaxation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have no problem with Leung itself, but its presence within Faunce changes the tone of the entire building. To fix this, Leung should be used differently. For a start, it could be designed to be more relaxing than the pretentious reading room it currently is. It wasn’t designed to be purely a study space, and there isn’t anything preventing students from using it for other purposes. But the addition of, say, even a single ping-pong table could go a long way in signalling that those sending glares at anyone speaking above a whisper are in the wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet while a more clear design could be beneficial, Brown has tried this before. Last year, a “poll” (or rather, a very large piece of paper and some markers) was left in Leung for student to comment on how they wanted Leung to be used. The University also seems to have tried to compromise by playing music on a few select days. This, of course, satisfied no one, frustrating those who frequent Leung to study but flying under the radar for those who do not.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the real problem is us. It shouldn’t take a sunny, 65-degree day to make us realize that we need a break. Students need an indoor space in which to relax once in a while. The only natural space for this is Faunce — so out of all the campus spaces, can we at least leave our Campus Center untouched by work? To those who want a space to study: Feel free to work as much as you like, but at least do me the courtesy of walking 100 steps to the Rockefeller Library. Read in the Leung if you like, but stop bringing your essays and your judgmental glares into our Campus Center. And to the University: You make it hard enough for us to relax already; you should at least give us a place to do it when we do find the time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The sheer number of students on the Main Green make it clear that we have both the desire and the time to relax at some point during our days here, yet the lack of space provided by the University makes this next to impossible in the winter months. It’s absurd that a university of the caliber of Brown has no general recreational space for students apart from a couple sad pool tables in a windowless room. The quickest and most effective way to accomplish this is to convert Leung. If we have to, I’m sure we could change the culture of the space. But really, Brown, make this easy on us and redo it. In the building most heavily visited by prospective students, let’s at least try to make Brown look fun.</span></p>

		<title>Johnson ’19: Empathy for Middlebury</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Headlines about the visit of controversial libertarian and political scientist Charles Murray to Middlebury College March 2 were sensational and full of click-bait. The swirling media storm, which included titles such as “‘Bell Curve’ Author Attacked by Protesters at Middlebury College” and “<a href="https://thefederalist.com/2017/03/07/middlebury-college-enabled-student-riot-charles-murrays-visit/">How Middlebury College Enabled the Riot,</a>” leaned toward harsh critiques of the student protesters. Many of those critiques are fair and can help create productive discourse between people with differing ideologies. But to progress toward that open and inclusive discourse, we need to develop a more nuanced view of the protests that does more than simply vilify the student protesters. We need to look at the incident with more empathy and respect toward the protesters’ deep-rooted and valid concerns. The prominent narratives in the media, however, fall short.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Critics of the Middlebury protesters depict the protest as uninformed because many of the protesters had not read Murray’s work. While that criticism is completely valid ­— we should never embrace anti-intellectualism — it was also a generalization: There were, in fact, students in the room who had read Murray’s material. Inspired by Middlebury Professor Matt Dickinson’s preliminary presentations on Murray’s most controversial book, “The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,” students <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/middleburys-liberals-respond-to-an-protest-gone-wrong/518652/">placed</a> critical pamphlets on every chair in the hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That Middlebury lecture room should not be portrayed as an uninformed and disengaging crowd, even though there were some who refused to directly read Murray’s writing. And can protesters really be blamed from wanting to avoid reading Murray’s controversial and offensive material? It might have been a flawed way to engage in protest, but it is also understandable. The protesters were not just stereotypical coddled liberals promoting safe spaces and denying free speech; they were protesting the presentation of pseudoscientific white nationalism, which does not merit critical reading or analysis. As the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/charles-murray">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> points out, “Bell Curve” proposes that differences in IQ are linked to race and genetics. This is an egregious theory. Instead of condemning the crowd as intellectual cowards, we should try to empathize with the justifiable anger of the protesters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another common narrative among critics is that physical resistance is a flawed means of protest. While students did not have the chance to personally debate with Murray in an open discussion, protesters had every right to assertively demonstrate and voice their opinion. Taking up space and making noise toward a speaker whose research has been used to support arguments that some humans are genetically inferior is warranted. The protest was an important means of questioning the decisions of the Middlebury administration. The event, while proposed by a student organization, expanded to include president and professor introductions — it occurred with the blessing of the college president. That deserves questioning, and not just through the “rhetorical resilience” that Middlebury administration promotes. Certainly the protest should not have devolved into violence and left Professor Allison Stanger with a serious injury, but the students weren’t in the wrong by choosing to protest. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moreover, the mainstream media and social media posts painted a grisly picture of malicious Middlebury students. In reflecting on the event, Murray himself described the protest with hyperbolic and unnecessary language. He <a href="https://www.aei.org/publication/reflections-on-the-revolution-in-middlebury/">referred</a> to the protesting audience as “intellectual thugs” and described “their eyes as crazed and their expressions as snarls.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stanger’s Facebook post, while completely understandable, also used language that inflated the narrative of violence. She claimed that the scene resembled a “Baghdad scene from Homeland” and students “had effectively dehumanized” her, yet did not mention that Murray’s work left many students feeling dehumanized as well. The violence was inexcusable, but depictions like these are counterproductive.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, commentators claim that Middlebury students rejected an opportunity to expand their views, but the talk would hardly have done so. When reading the inflated defenses and criticisms of the Middlebury protests, I stumbled across the online <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/do-you-live-in-a-bubble-a-quiz-2/">quiz</a> “Do you live in a bubble?” and took it. The quiz<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was supposed to replicate an exercise from Murray’s book, “Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010” by evaluating superficial questions, such as beer preference and varsity letter awards, to predict your exposure to average “American mainstream culture.” The culture in the quiz of course excludes diverse experiences. By taking this quiz, I confronted Murray’s discourse, but do I believe that it was a productive or enlightening experience? Not at all. Murray’s ideas are based on such insular assumptions and poor reasoning that they don’t broaden perspectives — they simply propagate misinformation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should absolutely continue the dialogue on Middlebury and its implications for free speech in other colleges. We can learn from those events and make sure that our advocacy is more understanding and effective. Yet we also need to ensure that our discussion tackles the issue with more compassion and less judgment. The political atmosphere across the country is more contentious than ever before, and we can’t afford more sensational and inflammatory media projections than we already have.</span></p>

		<title>Kumar ’17: Collaboration over caricature</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/23/kumar-17-collaboration-caricature/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Tuesday, four candidates for top Undergraduate Council of Students and Undergraduate Finance Board positions published a letter in The Herald declaring that they “will not be seeking an endorsement from The Brown Daily Herald given The Herald’s history with people of color and marginalized groups on campus.” The Herald simultaneously ran an editorial detailing the steps it has taken in recent semesters to build a more inclusive organization and to highlight diverse perspectives on campus. The stunning gap between the oppressive institution painted by the candidates and the commitment to constant improvement expressed by the editorial board reveals that the candidates have not considered the recent institutional changes The Herald has pursued. Rather, they have targeted a living, increasingly diverse organization for the sake of political expediency.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">My defense of The Herald does not rest on its importance for the “freedom of expression” that the candidates cite in their letter as a commonly used excuse for “racist messaging.” I am more immediately concerned with the reduction of this publication — representing a community of over 150 students — to a caricature. By failing to acknowledge the steps that The Herald has taken since publishing two egregiously racist columns in the fall of 2015, the candidates cast doubt on their commitment “to wor(k) as liaisons as The Herald opens up lines of communication to begin this process” of improvement. In reality, this process actually began three semesters ago, and the lines of communication are already open. It is true that The Herald may have erred since the fall 2015 columns, but the candidates fail to reference any other specific transgressions. Their statements make suggestions with no evidence. Since many Brown students already viewed The Herald with suspicion, the candidates’ public excoriation of it likely solidified or expanded their support base while accomplishing little else. It seems that the letter serves no other purpose than to win votes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In reading that the candidates’ mission is “to support students of color at Brown,” my knee-jerk reaction is to point out that many students of color are members of The Herald. Even with the understanding that historically marginalized peoples can and do contribute to oppressive institutions, it seems preposterous to suggest that The Herald’s reputation is so tarnished that it should be ostracized by the candidates. The editorial board’s response acknowledges “the pain The Herald has caused marginalized communities, particularly through the racist columns that were published in fall 2015” before pointing to the institutional mechanisms subsequently implemented to create a more inclusive culture. These improvements include revamping the newspaper’s mission to prioritize diversity, editing opinions pieces more vigorously, creating “a diversity and inclusion advocate role” and holding mandatory workshops on writing about diverse perspectives. Granted, The Herald has not articulated many of these changes to the public, besides in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/15/editorial-revamping-commentary/">editorials</a> explaining changes to the opinions section and the<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/07/editorial-a-comment-on-comments/"> website’s comments section</a>. Though even better transparency is needed, the changes already show through in the choices The Herald makes in its daily coverage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">No publication is perfect, and the editorial recognizes that “The Herald has so much more work to do.” Indeed, it is vitally important to critique this newspaper to ensure that it continues to progress. But “critiquing” implies that The Herald offers something of value, and that improving it is a worthwhile task. By ignoring the recent work The Herald has done, the UCS and UFB candidates have not provided a thoughtful critique. In fact, they veer dangerously close to portraying an alternative reality in which this publication is defined solely by the racist columns it published in fall 2015 — an unproductive move for future leaders of the student body.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Why is The Herald worthy of earnest critique? The publication is a major source of information for students and shapes campus dialogue, attracting op-eds and letters from University administration, alums and student groups and generating conversations across campus about University policy and social justice issues. The very fact that the candidates singled out The Herald and then used it as a vehicle to express their perspective reveals the publication’s unavoidable position in campus dialogue. For better or for worse, The Herald essentially has a monopoly in the market of daily student newspapers at Brown. It has existed since 1891 and shows no signs of closing its doors in the near future. Given that The Herald is here to stay, both sides — Herald staff and the historically marginalized groups who wish to improve the publication — must work together under the assumption that they share a common goal. The candidates’ flashy letter denouncing The Herald exhibits no such desire for genuine cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Like the candidates, I, too, believe that “The Herald can do better to help make the concerns and ideas of these (marginalized) groups visible.” In my role as columnist, I have personally made an effort to bring some of these issues to the table, including inequalities and injustices on the basis of regional and national origin, race, gender and class. Of course, my writing is influenced by my own identity and privilege, so I would encourage those who wish to share other perspectives to join The Herald as writers or editors. It’s important to keep in mind that — especially after the Indigenous Peoples’ Day columns — much thought goes into all of the narratives that The Herald chooses to tell. I hope that, rather than vilifying the newspaper for political gain, the UCS and UFB candidates will stick to their word and work collaboratively to make The Herald a better, more inclusive publication.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron finally appeared in the small Q&amp;A room of about 50 students, the audience would be forgiven for exhaling a nostalgic sigh of relief. He emerged in a stately fashion; his youthful facial features and composed expressions were a reminder of another, more optimistic time — one when he was still prime minister, when Brexit seemed out of the question and a Trump presidency even more so. He was the familiar face of a disappearing world order that, despite its obvious failures, operated on a set of principles that brought a sense of stability.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And yet the audience would not be forgiven for allowing this initial sense of relief to linger. After all, the former prime minister sitting before us, legs crossed and fingers interlocked in confident anticipation of student questions, enacted misguided austerity measures under the purported aim of reducing the deficit. What resulted was an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/01/senior-tories-brexit-vote-leave-attacks-david-cameron-letter-nhs-staff">underfunded National Health Service</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/education-11677862">ballooning university tuition</a> and, broadly speaking, a fiscal policy that seemed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/30/david-cameron-cut-benefits-working-poor">disproportionately hurt the poor</a>. Most significantly, he was the man who provided last year’s populist movements with their first chance at victory by calling for a public referendum on European Union membership. Despite Cameron’s controversial legacy and some of his shortsighted statements, his talk was a timely reminder of a political establishment willing to welcome open dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I went into the talk with strong opinions about Brexit in particular. Soon after the Brexit votes were counted, I wrote about my immediate thoughts on the decision. I said that “Cameron … gambl(ed) away the fate of the international system and transform(ed) an internal Tory schism into a case study in the perils of <a href="http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2016/07/tyranny-in-britain/">‘tyranny of the majority.’”</a> The misguided decision to call for this vote alone is sufficient reason to designate him as a “bad” Prime Minister — a man who will be remembered by history not for his successes, but for one single failure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the Q&amp;A with invited students before the lecture, I asked Cameron about his decision to call for a referendum despite the obvious perils in doing so. I expected a non-response or evasion — why, after all, would a former prime minister substantively answer some American undergraduate? And yet, as he shifted his gaze from the floor to the audience and then back to the floor, he offered some thoughtful insights into his decision. He explained that the people had a fundamental right to vote on the means by which they were ruled and postponing the referendum or imposing voting quotas would only have delayed the inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unconvinced as I was, I was thankful that he attempted to put forth a genuine argument. As I sat listening to his responses to other students, his approach to answering questions remained consistent. He offered praise of questions he thought were interesting or well constructed and polite disagreement with the framing of other questions. But most importantly, his responses were generally nuanced and coherent, intelligent and well-thought-out. I sympathized with some of his views and scoffed at others, but felt that the discussion taking place was always productive. Despite the obvious reasons why one might not like Cameron, there was refreshing common ground and a commitment to reasoned discussion that simply does not seem as possible in American politics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, this is chiefly a consequence of the political atmosphere in the United Kingdom compared with that in the United States — put simply, U.K. politics are operating within a more liberal paradigm today and the divides within Parliament therefore do not seem as large as those in Congress. For many Labour Party supporters, “Dodgy Dave” was the man who implemented Tory policies that targeted the poor while simultaneously privileging London’s wealthy elites. But in the United States, Cameron was a compassionate conservative — a centrist of the kind one might see in the Democratic Party establishment. His speech’s opening dig, in which he expressed relief at not having to listen to President Trump’s wiretaps, seemed to exemplify exactly this — it was safe, diplomatic, sterile and calculated “consensus” humor that would not have drawn laughs had it not come from a former prime minister.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And yet, amid Cameron’s professional championing of the liberal 21st century order, he made fatuous claims that dispelled his almost transfixing charm and aura of reason. When addressing the criticism that an interventionist foreign policy had bolstered terrorist groups, he was especially weak and unconvincing. In particular, he asked why an aggressive foreign policy would give a terrorist the right to commit murder — a rhetorical question so shortsighted that it would feel redundant to remark that it misses the point. Perhaps more significantly, he pointed out that 9/11 occurred prior to the Iraq War. We would therefore be misguided, he suggested, to blame U.S. or U.K. foreign policy for exacerbating terrorism or destabilizing the Middle East. To this I would simply respond: It’s 2017. Does anybody really believe this?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All of this is to say that the experience of having Cameron on campus induced a series of conflicting emotions. At first, I was struck by the extreme privilege of receiving the chance to hear him talk, then cautious thankfulness for his charisma, commitment to reasoned discourse and ample ability to defend his views. This was followed by a sinking disappointment at his legacy and policies. This resulted in an unsettling amalgam of gratitude and frustration. I was left both stacking my counterarguments to this capricious, “conscious” conservative and simultaneously hoping that one day our political enemies too can be so damn reasonable.</span></p>

		<title>Campbell &#039;18, Campanelli &#039;18: Don’t ostracize The Herald</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Between Sunday night and Monday morning, nearly every major candidate for the Undergraduate Council of Students and the Undergraduate Finance Board issued a statement via Facebook denouncing The Herald and stating that they would not be seeking The Herald’s endorsement. This was followed on Tuesday by a joint letter published in The Herald that repeated this position and called on The Herald to work with the UCS toward reform. Every year The Herald endorses candidates that they believe will best represent the student body in working with the University. In their rejection of The Herald, the candidates cited the two racist columns published in fall 2015 as well as the “exploiting (of) narratives of students of color and low income students.” We, as a columnist and a previous op-ed contributor for The Herald, recognize the hurt that was caused by these columns and in no way want to understate their impact on marginalized groups and on our campus as a whole. Regarding the Herald’s reporting side, s<span class="s1">ome level of error is unfortunately always present in even the most sound journalism.</span> <span class="s1">We cannot speak directly to the misquotes mentioned by the UCS candidates. Yet all news publications, from time to time, make mistakes. All newspapers misquote and print retractions. </span>We have no desire to invalidate the experiences of any UCS candidate, or of any Brown community member. Yet The Herald, as a key institution working for accountability on campus and one that has made great efforts to remedy its ailments over the last two years, should not be delegitimized in this way. As important news outlets on the national stage are repeatedly labeled “fake” by our own government, we should not allow this trend of ostracizing the press to spread to campus.</p>
<p class="p2">We need The Herald. We need a highly visible and frequently published newspaper. We need it to hold our student government accountable, present information about the administration that is not readily available or transparent and cover the diverse activities occurring around campus. In their Tuesday letter, the UCS candidates suggest that The Herald must work with them to be reformed. The Herald can improve, but this improvement should not be led by UCS. Changes to The Herald cannot be led by an organization it is meant to hold accountable because then the newspaper loses its freedom and its core purpose. The UCS, like any governing body, has the potential to stray from the desires of the students it represents. The administration has the poten<span class="s2">tial to conduct actions that harm students. The Corporation often makes decisions and rulings that counter many of the beliefs held by students on campus. We need to support a newspaper that is willing to publish articles critical of the UCS, administration, Corporation and student body because without such a newspaper, we will not only fail to hold these powerful organizations accountable but also fall into a self-reinforcing echo chamber devoid of critical analysis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Our point is not to diminish the mistakes The Herald has made in the past. The Opinions section has published very hurtful columns, and while the editorial board has worked hard to vastly improve the editing process, we understand that members of the student body may not yet be ready to forgive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But The Herald’s news serves too great a purpose to be cast as unnecessary.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The UCS candidates charged The Herald with “falsely manufacturing narratives by misquoting students” but cite no specific instances in which this has occurred. Given the current political climate, we must be wary of making such broad claims without providing any tangible evidence. The Trump administration has made the same accusations to degrade legitimate news sources that hold him and other leaders accountable. This has allowed the charge of “fake news” to be appropriated by the Trump administration and to be attributed to CNN and the New York Times, rather than to the alt-right publications for which the term was coined. Charges like these currently threaten the free press in the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The Herald is the most significant provider of news about the Brown community. With 150 members, The Herald has beats on the administration, student life, and yes, UCS. No one else covers campus so thoroughly. Who else is here to hold UCS, the administration, or the Corporation accountable? If any of these institutions transgress, it will be The Herald that alerts students. It will be The Herald that provides vital information to those who want to push back. It will be The Herald that holds these institutions to their word, ensuring that they look out for the interests of the student body. The Herald has made mistakes. But The Herald serves far too great a purpose as a news organization for us not to support it as it seeks to improve.</span></p>

		<title>Colby &#039;20: Stop overvaluing Brown athletics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Brown’s relative underinvestment in athletics represents what is both sensible and proper for such an institution. Overinvestment in sports and the selective manipulation of admission criteria by peer institutions for the purpose of increasing overall athletic success has distorted the weight top-tier universities should place on athletics. As The Herald has previously reported, Brunonian underachievement is caused by a lack of funding and institutional interest, but this should not result in any changes to Brown’s waning institutional investment in sports. If anything, Brown’s emphasis on athletic recruitment and success should be decreased in the future.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Supposedly “holistic” admission goals are already diluted by the disproportionate focus athletic recruitment receives. Athletes undoubtedly play an important role in a university, but the extent to which admission standards are altered for sports recruitment is nonsensical.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Ivy League, academic standards are systematically reduced for athletic recruitment. Under the current system, Ivy League schools evaluate applicants using an “Academic Index” number that combines students’ grade point averages and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2011/12/25/sports/25ivy-GFX.html?ref=sports">standardized test scores</a>. This is not the sole metric used in admission, but coaches consider this number in recruitment, assuming that athletes and sports teams will have considerably lower Academic Index scores than their non-athletic peers. Within the Ivy League, coaches attempt to keep the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/sports/before-athletic-recruiting-in-the-ivy-league-some-math.html">“institution-wide cohort of recruited student-athletes within one standard deviation of the mean.”</a> Academic Index score for all students. Dramatic actions are taken to ensure this is the case. Recruitment of academically successful benchwarmers who never play is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/sports/before-athletic-recruiting-in-the-ivy-league-some-math.html">one tool used to ensure the team maintains a passable academic standing</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Moreover, a worryingly large number of admission spots are actively reserved for recruited athletes. Brown currently reserves 205 spots for recruited athletes in each class, which constitute 13 percent of <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/04/27/unsuccessful-teams-reflect-institutional-athletic-changes/">each year’s cohort</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This institutionalized alteration of standards signifies a departure from what makes academic institutions like Brown truly great. Brown is not known for sports; it is known for academic leadership, research and innovation. This is why universities are first and foremost academic institutions. As such, athletes should be subject to the same admission standards that apply to all other applicants.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Adjustment of admission criteria and quotas can be a sensible way to advance Brown’s declared commitments to “encouraging diversity” and forming a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/apply">“dynamic mix of individuals that makes for the most fascinating and productive undergraduate community.” </a>However, the current system does the exact opposite. By prioritizing specific athletic activities over other equally demanding and rewarding extracurricular activities, Brown undermines these goals. It is true that sports can add value and diversity to a university community. Certainly, part of Brown’s holistic application review rewards students with outstanding talents even if they fall below average Academic Index of admits. But Brown — like the rest of the Ivy League — doesn’t offer institutionalized assistance in admission, reserved spots, reduced admission standards or expensive recruitment programs to students who might promote the university’s diversity in other ways. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yes, sports teams enhance the community in every college, but the resources dispensed to form such a community are not justified. The community spirit that interscholastic athletic competition provides would still exist without such drastic recruitment efforts. Additionally, support for athletes and attendance at games — which are both very low at Brown — would likely be enhanced in a school where teams are composed of largely walk-on and non-recruited athletes, especially considering the fact that the majority of Brown students oppose <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/11/17/majority-undergrads-oppose-reserving-spots-athletes/">existing admission criteria for athletes</a>. Brown has historically performed poorly in most athletics and this lack of success has not affected the overall community within the University. Therefore, in a worst-case scenario, decreasing the emphasis placed on recruitment can only have marginally negative effects. Still, walk-on athletes have in the past proven that they can rival recruited athletes from other institutions. Women’s rugby, with no recruiting spots in its first year as a varsity team, found themselves in “an Ivy League championship in its first season, followed by a second-place finish in 2015,” <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/04/27/unsuccessful-teams-reflect-institutional-athletic-changes/">The Herald previously reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It has been argued that sports offer unmatched opportunities to learn discipline, social understanding and leadership, and that that these opportunities justify <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2017/02/28/letter-2-28-2/">such recruitment efforts</a>. The accuracy of this claim is up for debate, but it is worth noting that no other activity at Brown has the privilege of recruiting students based on those traits. Sports may instill dedication and discipline in athletes, but non-athletic activities offer these same opportunities to learn and grow.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is by no means an argument to cease the recruitment of athletes in general. Athletes at Brown are among the most hardest-working and talented students in NCAA Division I <a href="http://www.brownbears.com/general/ncaaapr2016">competition</a>. But Brown should continue, as it did under the governance of former President Ruth J. Simmons, to shift its focus away from a disproportionate emphasis on athletics. The University can also improve the way it recruits athletes. Simmons, for example, vocally suggested that Brown raise its Academic Index average above the Ivy League’s recruitment minimum in an effort “to increase the representativeness of athletes at Brown,” The Herald previously reported. After all, sports have a role at every college and university, but current recruitment efforts considerably overvalue athletic achievement. Increasing the University’s investment in such activities would be misguided.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">As we near Passover next Monday, I am reminded of a story told each year about five rabbis living in Roman times. After the traditional Passover meal, they are said to have sat up all night recounting the story of Exodus: How the Israelites were kept as slaves in Egypt, how God cursed the Egyptians with 10 plagues and, finally, how the Israelites were redeemed and led toward the Promised Land. Baffling their students, they told and retold the tale until it was time for morning prayers, finding new meaning with every recitation. This story speaks to the power of the Exodus narrative to be constantly reinterpreted, a process which continues to this day. It is a story which has been reapportioned across literature, artwork and political rhetoric for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="p3">In particular, the Exodus narrative has long been viewed as an overarching theme in American history. In a recent column in the New York Times, David Brooks went so far as to blame the current state of American politics on Exodus’s fading relevance as an “organizing national myth.” The story, in his view, gave an order and purpose to the great movements of peoples — like Puritan colonization, westward expansion and Great Migration — that shaped American history. He then takes it one step further, inexplicably blaming social justice movements as the cause of this decline. He writes, “American history is taught less as a progressively realized grand narrative and more as a series of power conflicts between oppressor and oppressed.” There is plenty to take issue with here — namely that those grand narratives came about precisely because of oppression. Brooks carefully skirts around this omission by bizarrely implying that Frederick Douglass and Langston Hughes experienced the Exodus narrative in the same way that the Pilgrims did.</p>
<p class="p3">Still, Brooks is right about two things: Societies are most unified and functional when tied together by great national narratives, and the story of Exodus suits America. But both Exodus and American history are messier than Brooks acknowledges; both involve accomplishments to take pride in and moments of quandary and moral failure. Viewing America as an Exodus tale requires an honest historical reckoning, and an understanding that we have been sometime-Israelites and sometime-Pharaohs — an understanding that will make us stronger as a nation, not weaker.</p>
<p class="p3">In his seminal work on nationalism, “Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism,” Benedict Anderson writes that nations depend on a link to their “glorious past” in order to maintain a hope for a shared future. Shared stories can connect people who have very little in common aside from an American (or French, or Brazilian) identity. But those stories can only signify American-ness if they represent the experiences of all Americans — not just those who have traditionally held positions of power, nor just the “real Americans” of the heartland, but also the recent immigrants who came here because they saw a narrative worth retelling and contributing to. America’s story has been told both by those who have had microphones handed to them and by those who have been forced to shout to be heard above a whisper. To pretend that our national myth is a calmly told, linear fable with a moral at the end, as Brooks does, is to ignore what America has been and to underestimate what it can be.</p>
<p class="p3">In a time when we can’t seem to agree on whether or not basic facts are true, the task of constructing an “organizing national myth” seems almost too great to imagine. Religious narratives in particular are not applicable or relevant to everyone, and the American narrative does not have to be shaped by Judeo-Christian traditions. And a good argument can be made that misguided and antiquated myths — like a bygone American greatness in need of restoration — have done a good deal of harm. But just as the Exodus story is told and retold, critiqued and re-examined each Passover, deliberating on our past can teach us a lot about who we are. While exclusion and erasure dominate the national conversation, and walls are erected at our borders and around our institutions, Exodus — Biblical and American — can be one of many stories that remind us of the importance of compassion and aiding the oppressed because we were among them. It reminds us of the injustice that we’ve come from and that we are committed to fighting.</p>
<p class="p3">Brooks sees the Exodus narrative as a story that occurred in the past, ignoring the fact that the storyline is still ongoing — and its lessons hold true today with a stronger urgency than ever. The Passover story has never been confined to the past. For thousands of years, it has been traditional to tell and retell the story, and at the end of the meal to acknowledge that slavery and oppression persist around the world and at our very own doorsteps. Exodus is not about the past; it is about actively ensuring a better future for those still enslaved. As we say to close the Passover meal, next year, may we all be free.</p>

		<title>Smith GS: Turning down the cacophony</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Up until a few years ago, I began each day by reading the newspaper over morning coffee. It was a ritual I looked forward to — a pleasurable, orienting experience that left me feeling comfortable and ready to embrace the day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But these days, I do not feel this way at all when I open my laptop in Blue State Coffee to read the news. Today’s media landscape looks nothing like the single reliable daily newspaper our parents and grandparents could count on for all their information. In the age of digital media, news comes at us from all sides, and new sources are available in just a few clicks. When I look through the news, it is a disquieting experience. There is simply too much information coming at me, and I don’t know who it’s coming from — amazingly, I’ve realized that I don’t know the names of any reporters. This generally holds true for most Americans: According to a <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/07/loyalty-and-source-attention/">Pew Research Center survey</a>, only 38 percent of news readers can remember the sources every single time of articles they had read in a two-hour time span. In an age where information is increasingly politicized and contentious — and when the president can arbitrarily label a certain outlet as “fake news” — this is a terrifying statistic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We must be more discerning, active consumers of news by re-thinking our approach to engaging with media. One way to do that is by thinking about who is writing news and how it is produced — the structures and practices that reporters and news organizations use to create content. This can help readers better wade through a divisive political climate that disorients us through the sheer amount of conflicting information.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Readers can actively engage with the news in many ways. At the most basic level, we as readers need to narrow our focus and make pointed choices about where we consume content. We can select sources we trust, follow beats that interest us and pursue a wide-range of news angles and styles — from financial perspectives in the Wall Street Journal to long-form pieces in the New Yorker. My approach has been to select individual reporters and columnists with interests that align with mine. Amid the growing national skepticism around news media, this strategy allows me to forge a more personal and trusting connection with news reporters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is also a way to re-think the “echo chamber” problem. Rather than replacing a cacophony of liberal voices with a cacophony of liberal and conservative voices, I’m replacing the cacophony altogether. I’m turning the volume way, way down, and listening closely to a select group of individuals from both sides of the political spectrum.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But a consequence of seeking individual writers is a sense of familiarity. If you read the same person every week, you begin to develop a relationship (albeit a one-sided one), you understand their reporting practices, their regular sources, their repeating themes. Knowing the writer in these ways both promotes a sense of comfort when reading them and makes us more critical, participatory consumers of news.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some might argue that this approach to information limits the diversity of our perspectives. Aren’t more perspectives better than fewer? Shouldn’t we always be making an effort to get second, third and fourth opinions on a matter, so that we can understand it from as many angles as possible? To a certain degree, yes; but if we push that argument to its limit, we would still omit more perspectives than we embrace. Even if we read 20 articles written by 20 different people on the same topic, we’re neglecting to read hundreds of others — and probably confusing ourselves in the process. So should we really be striving to read more and more articles? And can we really pay attention and listen closely to each article we read with equal intensity?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now, more than ever, we need to sort through the myriad sources of news and think more carefully about the information we absorb. We need to move beyond an abstract, impersonal relationship with news and remember that news is written by individuals with unique perspectives, backgrounds and practices. It may not appeal to everyone ­— some people might get a rush from the overload of information and enjoy the process of swinging from source to source, headline to headline. For me, it’s too much. I need to be more selective and systematic. Thus far, my approach is working. I’m finally starting to feel good after reading the news in the morning.</span></p>

		<title>Vilsan ’19: Why we need the EU</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/05/vilsan-19-need-eu/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A recent article published by the <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21719188-it-marks-its-60th-birthday-european-union-poor-shape-it-needs-more">Economist</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>paints a bleak picture of the future of the European Union: Upcoming elections in the member states have the potential of reversing the freedoms EU citizens have enjoyed for six decades, and the economic climate in Europe isn’t much of a pick-me-up. Reading the article, I couldn’t help but feel anxious at the thought of the European community crumbling. Should I book a flight home for summer break before it’s too late? But no matter how many pessimistic articles I read or bleak political prognoses I watch, the European within me believes that the EU-supported harmony — made of different cultures, languages, people and experiences that constitute the continent I call home — will be enough to hold Europe together in times of economic and political uncertainty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Europe evokes a sense of community and inclusion I haven’t encountered anywhere else in the world. Yet, as governments across the continent adopt populist policies and begin to push against the European Union, the tranquil European community I grew up and fell in love with is in danger of extinction. But I’ve preserved my confidence in the European spirit, despite what projections and polling may have you believe. The Europe I know and love will persist long into the future, regardless of today’s political trends, because the EU isn’t just a short-lived bureaucratic annoyance that barks orders at an unwilling audience — it is part of the fabric of European life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The dissolution of the EU will do more than create political instability — it will deprive future generations of European citizens of the peace and community that I had the privilege of experiencing. As a teenager, I took pride in the fact that my country, Romania, was a member nation and thus committed to upholding these shared values. I remember, when I was 10 years old, Romania underwent the process of joining the EU. My fellow Romanians celebrated our integration into an organization aimed at protecting the rights that, under decades of communist rule, we were denied. My whole life I have enjoyed the freedoms associated with the EU, never feeling like a complete foreigner in the other states regardless of language barriers or cultural differences. This openness is more than just a politcal or economic fact; it has made a real difference in my life, affording EU citizens the opportunity to study, travel and develop meaningful relationships with one another.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The EU has deeply influenced European values and created work and travel freedoms for member citizens. According to Ian Manners,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>professor of political science at the University of Copenhagen, the EU functions as a “<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-5965.00353/pdf">normative power</a>” in Europe. In order for nations to join the EU, they must accept and implement certain norms, as well as adopt free trade and travel agreements. The EU has often been criticized for acting like a state and therefore interfering with the autonomy of its member nations. (It is for this very reason that Brexit happened.) Especially in today’s economic climate, the perception of foreign forces influencing national politics is quick to cause anxiety and fear. In reality, the EU functions less like an overly involved parent and more like an organization designed to keep European nations from dissolving into nationalism and war. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When it comes to preserving peace, the EU has fostered success. In 2012, the Nobel Committee <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/world/2016/05/how-valid-claim-eu-has-delivered-peace-europe">awarded</a> the EU the Nobel Peace Prize for “transforming most of Europe from a continent of war to a continent of peace.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The organization’s normative effect on policy has done more than add a cumbersome foreign presence in national governments.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Today’s political climate is not the first that can be described as nationalistic and fearful of foreign influence and dangers. It was precisely these sentiments that were responsible for the two World Wars and, arguably, the majority of wars in history. The EU was created to rise above political trends and promote shared European values of democracy, law, social justice and freedom. It saddens me as a European abroad to witness this organization be challenged by the social and political forces it was created to fight. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the current social opposition to the EU, my experience with the freedoms and values promoted by the organization have me optimistic that, while nationalistic and populist waves are temporary, the European community is here to stay. As older generations are pushing back against the EU’s norms and regulations, it is the responsibility of our generation to make our voices heard in EU politics. In last year’s Brexit referendum, the younger generation was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining, but ultimately, it was the votes of the older generation that solidified the decision to leave. Young people — who tend to be more liberal and internationalist in outlook and who must live with the repercussions of the dissolution of the European Union — understand the value of the freedoms protected by the organization and must fight to preserve them. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It isn’t often that environmentalists cheer the views of Trump administration officials on climate change. Yet, that’s exactly what happened when, earlier this month, Secretary of Defense James Mattis revealed that he does not share President Trump’s climate skepticism. As ProPublica reported, Mattis emphasized the dangers of global warming in written exchanges with several members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Climate change is a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of-government response,” Mattis wrote to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen D-NH after his Jan. 12 confirmation hearing. “If confirmed, I will ensure that the Department of Defense plays its appropriate role within such a response by addressing national security aspects.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Advocates of eco-friendly, evidence-based policymaking seemed relieved by Mattis’ testimony. Shana Udvardy, the Union of Concerned Scientists’ climate preparedness specialist, called Mattis “the lone climate change soldier within this administration’s cabinet.” The Sierra Club tweeted that Trump and his budget director “should listen to their own secretary of defense, who says climate change is a threat right now.” And National Geographic published this blaring headline in February: “Who’s Still Fighting Climate Change? The U.S. Military.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is reassuring to know that Mattis and the armed forces, well-positioned to reign in the current administration’s worst excesses, can countervail Trump’s refusal to accept climate change as a threat to human civilization. But environmental activists shouldn’t get their hopes up. Far from being a potential ally in the crusade against climate change, the American military is more interested in accommodating an apocalyptic future — one in which a sweltering planet is convulsed in climate-induced conflict — than it is in addressing the root causes of global warming. A civilian might approach the mess of climate change more intuitively, with a heavier emphasis on domestic prevention instead of unreliable treaties or last-minute emergency measures. After all, environmental policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and encouraging the adoption of renewable energy could presumably forestall any doomsday tumult in the first place. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But from the military’s standpoint, the answer to climate change lies not at the intersection of social change and public policy, but within the framework of national security. In its 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Department of Defense found that the “pressures caused by climate change” are “threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability and social tensions — conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.” And, according to the Department of the Army, these pressures in totality presage “an era of persistent conflict, which for the foreseeable future will place us in a security environment much more ambiguous and unpredictable than that faced during the Cold War.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The military’s dystopian characterization of the geopolitical future is revealing. In the eyes of the military, climate change isn’t a problem because it will irreparably harm humanity and the environment. It’s a problem because these harms, culminating in overburdened governments and violent conflict, will eventually reach Americans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This conceptualization of climate change — as a primarily national security concern, not a sociopolitical one — has indelibly shaped the military’s planned reaction to impending climatological chaos.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Consider the Center for Naval Analyses’ report, “National Security and the Threat of Climate Change.” In the executive summary, the Center’s Military Advisory Board, consisting of retired generals and admirals, warns that climate change can “disrupt our way of life” and “force changes in the way we keep ourselves safe and secure.” More specifically, the report predicts that the United States will have to “accept large numbers of immigrant and refugee populations” and “may be drawn more frequently” into burgeoning conflict zones as “weak and failing governments” struggle to maintain internal cohesion. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is worth observing here the Americentrism of the board’s prediction. The report bemoans the larger responsibility the United States must assume in maintaining international order, but other countries face burdens that are exponentially more extreme. For example, a 2003 Pentagon study forecasted that, while American agriculture will suffer marginally, rising sea levels and coastal erosion will render most of Bangladesh “nearly uninhabitable,” unleashing a “drinking water and humanitarian crisis.” By elevating American climate security concerns above those of other nations, then, the military sees developing countries and their vulnerability to climate change as a problem to be begrudgingly managed, not an urgent human concern. In doing so, the military also implicitly prizes the preservation of a privileged few over others and demands a more interventionist foreign policy. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> And, as the report shows, the military hasn’t yet devised any ground-breaking or elegant strategies to counter global warming, apart from “assist(ing) nations at risk” and “setting targets for long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.” This dearth of climate innovation is revealing. Green activists must understand that the military is more concerned with managing a planet ravaged by global warming and climate warfare — not preventing it, or encouraging any of the dramatic transformations needed to avoid imminent catastrophe. This is not to say that the Pentagon cannot contribute to the green movement by communicating strategic realities to skeptical congressmen, or by pioneering new fields of research in clean-energy technologies. In the long-term, though, the lens of “national security” cannot be the only answer to global warming.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only does such a worldview assign special importance to developed countries at the expense of poorer ones, but it also does little to prevent the conflicts and cataclysms that will ultimately arise from climate change. As such, it is unlikely that Mattis, no matter how enlightened or well-intentioned his congressional testimony, will deviate from his own outlook as secretary of defense and more meaningfully service the environmentalist cause.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Mattis’ recent comments about climate change should be taken with extreme caution. The military can’t solve all our problems, and as the brawl between sensible, science-based policy and personal whim rages on, we ought to defer to a fact we’ve long known: Only when our civilian leaders accept the reality of climate change — and not just the heads of our military — can we truly breathe a sigh of collective relief.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">I have always considered myself a champion of the importance of language. That stringing letters into a meaningful order can empower movements and fuel real-world change does nothing short of mystify me. I can typically be found declaring the power of the written word to any unlucky friend, relative or tall object that vaguely resembles a human being. But in the midst of my love for metaphors and lyrical imagery, I was neglecting something simple yet fundamental: the importance of precisely understanding a word’s definition.</p>
<p class="p2">There have been more instances than I’d like to admit where a conversation in the Ratty enters lexical territory I am unfamiliar with. What I’m more embarrassed to confess is the amount of times I do not seek a word’s true definitions — whether it in the moment or afterwards — and instead assume that a contextual guess is adequate. At best this technique is insufficient; at worst, it can threaten the very core of the movements driven by these words.</p>
<p class="p3">Whereas we can indefinitely debate over an author’s meaning via a metaphor, the intention behind the language of social movements is essential to its function. The most prominent example that comes to mind is the common <a href="http://jezebel.com/5827709/lets-invent-a-catchy-new-word-for-feminism">misconstruing of “feminism.”</a> Although the term is constantly associated in the media with a collection of strange descriptions (male-hating and no-shaving are two favorites), one who adheres to this “ism” simply concurs with the notion that all sexes are equal. And while a quick Google search will reveal that <a href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Feminism">“feminism”</a> can take many forms — from eco- to post-structuralist to socialist feminisms — the original equality-for-all sentiment of the term has provided the basis for these related movements. Thus, when we assume that surmising the meaning of words central to a movement will do, adding the newly defined word to our own repertoire, we play a detrimental game of Telephone. Suddenly, we unintentionally commit two sins: The first is stripping a word of its history and disrupting its future legacy; the second is that, over time, people engage in meaningless conversations, using the same words but obliviously talking about different things.</p>
<p class="p3">Words do change over time — as the world shifts and new people and things appear, inevitably our lexicon alters. But certain terms rely on their roots to ground and strengthen their meaning. To preserve these origins, we have to stop the chain of alterations before it begins. Whether the tool of choice is Google or an interruption in the conversation, find out the true meaning of the language you use.</p>
<p class="p3">Furthermore, if you find yourself in the position where your own lingo provokes more silence than responses from others, consider whether everyone in the room actually knows what you’re talking about. A discussion over the definition of a term could make a topic accessible to someone for the first time ever, encouraging participation in a dialogue that was once distant. Moreover, the act itself of discussing these meanings prompts us to internalize the importance of these words and their histories.</p>
<p class="p3">As we begin to formulate the arguments and slogans in support of our various causes, we inevitably jumpstart the process of demanding change. Thus, if we only have a half-hearted understanding of the words we use, we can only half-heartedly partake in our work. New Yorker writer Nora Caplan-Bricker aptly describes how dictionaries often associate negative adjectives with women — feminism is <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/should-dictionaries-do-more-to-confront-sexism">“rabid” and women’s voices are “shrill.”</a> The debate over whether dictionaries should be descriptive or prescriptive — whether they should solely reflect existing attitudes or actually guide the way we use language — is as fundamental as it is unresolved. Yet, I want to suggest that while we can argue about this tension in the context of dictionaries, there should be nothing ambiguous about its implication in our lives. As we work to combat injustice, our prescriptions for social ills hinge on our understanding of the descriptive power of our language. Progress depends on the language we use on our protest signs, in our leaders’ speeches and throughout our social media spaces. But without truly understanding the meaning of this language, our activist endeavors are slated to stumble from the start.</p>

		<title>Richardson &#039;20: Pinpointing procrastination</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/06/richardson-20-pinpointing-procrastination/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">According to my friends, I was nowhere to be found first semester and practically non-existent up until this point in second semester. No group work. No kickbacks. No parties. No drama. Apparently, when we returned from spring break, they were downright shocked to see me. I was the epitome of the student who took as long as possible on assignments, even if that meant cancelling on my friends a few too many times. Though they often wondered how I spent my time, I felt best when I invested in being a college student: a life which consists of a lot of long days and long nights.</p>
<p class="p3">A conversation with my friends stands out in my memory. Three of us were at a men’s soccer game talking about classes and the homework we had to complete before the coming week. One of my friends said, “I have four assignments due this Wednesday. All of them were assigned last Wednesday, and I haven’t started any of them.” While my group of friends started laughing, I stared at him blankly. An older man sitting behind us commented, “You need to do your work,” and walked off, disgruntled. A few nights later, around 7:30 p.m., I was talking to another friend who mentioned having a six-page paper due at midnight which he had not started.</p>
<p class="p3">Why are stories like these so common at Brown? I tend to interpret this phenomenon as a kind of destructive competitive impulse, where people strive to do better than others while doing less. Studies have shown that procrastination stems from being forced into a challenge that we feel unprepared for, which results in “self-handicapping,” or deliberately doing things that set us up for failure. Echoes of this explanation sound in my mind as I think of Brown students. I find that we have a tendency to over-achieve in everything we do. The stress created when striving to attain “good” grades leads us to procrastination. Perhaps Brown students purposely wait, even subconsciously, until the last minute so that they can provide excuses for an undesirable grade, in an attempt to mitigate the constant pressure to get a 4.0.</p>
<p class="p3">In a piece in the Atlantic about the psychological reasons for procrastination, Megan McArdle argues that a procrastinator’s tendencies are overcome only when their “fears of turning in nothing eventually surpasses their fears of turning in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/why-writers-are-the-worst-procrastinators/283773/">something terrible.”</a> When we suppress our fear of failure by procrastinating and thus make excuses for work we recognize as insufficient, we act contrary to what it means to be a Brown student. Where is the confidence and pride in our work we demonstrated on our Brown applications? Of course, getting it all done can be much harder than we ever imagined. But we were each accepted here for a reason — we have the ability to produce work that we can feel proud of, if we put in the time to do so. At a college that provides us with so many unique academic opportunities, it is important to maximize every minute of our time here at Brown.</p>
<p class="p3">This is not to say that we should be robots who solely focus on the completion of academic responsibilities — a balance that many here struggle to strike, myself included. Rather, engaging in truly gratifying activities without worrying about returning home to complete an assignment that is due at midnight is far more fulfilling than anything procrastination has to offer. Time management is not easy to master, but it is a critical tool that will be used daily, especially once we graduate from Brown. With the close of this semester approaching, I encourage you all to set aside your fear of failure and procrastinate your tendency to procrastinate: Postpone procrastination so much that all of your work is completed during the time that you usually spend putting off the actual assignments. Instead of waiting all day to start something, start it so you have all day. Reframing your perspective on deadlines is the first step in emerging from the abyss of procrastination.</p>

		<title>Schapiro ’19: Give Opening Day its due</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A few years ago, Budweiser began promoting a White House petition aimed at making Major League Baseball’s Opening Day a national holiday. After it surpassed the requisite 100,000 signatures a few days before the deadline, it was considered by the Obama White House. I was a signatory, so I received the response from Josh Earnest, deputy press secretary at the time, and — even though he seems like a nice guy on TV — a Royals fan.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“For more than a century, American presidents have celebrated Opening Day — from President William Taft’s 1910 first pitch from the stands to former President Barack Obama toeing the rubber at Nationals Park in 2010,” it read. For a White House Press Secretary, Earnest wrote eloquently on the meaning of baseball and especially Opening Day. It’s a new beginning — a clean slate, any one of the many metaphors that are available.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He went on: “While we are sympathetic to your pitch to make Opening Day a national holiday, it’s a little outside our strike zone: Creating permanent federal holidays is traditionally the purview of Congress,” he wrote. “So, it’s up to the men and women on Capitol Hill to decide whether to swing at this pitch.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Earnest is correct: While a President can use an executive order to <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2004/06/who_can_declare_a_holiday.html)">declare</a> a one-time holiday, it takes Congressional approval to create a permanent one. While he’s lived up to his promises to be wildly unpredictable, somehow I don’t see President Trump utilizing executive power to celebrate the national pastime — just this week, he became the first sitting president in 100 years not to throw out a ceremonial first pitch on Opening Day after citing a scheduling conflict. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, if Opening Day is ever to take its rightful place as a national day of celebration, it will fall to Congress to make it happen. At first glance, it probably seems unlikely: After all, Congress, as a body, is not known for its speed and efficiency or for making decisions that make a majority of Americans happy. But right now, the Opening Day holiday may be just what the country needs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Consider it for a moment: Opening Day, the first Monday of every April, as a national holiday. A day of celebration — celebration of Spring, of warm weather and the sun finally showing itself, of new hopes and old friends, of the start of a new season of a very old game. Kids — who the day is really about — could be off from school, free to watch baseball or frolic in the outdoors. Jaded veterans, who work too hard the other 51 weeks of the year, would be given a day to enjoy the spring time and, if they choose to, the ballgame. Family reunions, a barbecue or a picnic at the park, baseball on the radio, spring in the air, nonagenarians grumbling about how the game was better when they were young, which it probably was.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Just look at the history of organized baseball. Professional baseball was first played in 1869, 24 years after the sport’s initial formulation. The first federal holidays were created in 1870. That’s right: Professional baseball is older than the concept of the federal holiday itself. It’s existed for about 61 percent of our nation’s history. It’s older than the Statue of Liberty, “The Star-Spangled Banner” as our official National Anthem and the President’s desk in the Oval Office. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And baseball isn’t just old — it’s storied too. Dizzy and Daffy, Satchel, Jackie and Hank, Home Run Baker, Cookie Lavagetto, the Hondo Hurricane, Bobo Holloman, the Homer in the Gloamin’, Merkle’s Blunder, Tinker to Evers to Chance … we can list iconic moments in baseball history until the cows come home. How about the game played at Hilton Head on Christmas Day 1862, with both teams made up of members of the Union army? Or how about, 149 years later, Mike Piazza’s home <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A3hmASpDqg">run</a> after 9/11? As Josh Earnest correctly notes, U.S. Presidents have been celebrating Opening Day since the early 20th century — and baseball fans have been celebrating Opening Day since just about the first one.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So, come on — look at baseball’s history and its inextricable connections with America in the 20th and 21st centuries. It’s as American as apple pie.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Federal holidays mark events of great importance, some practical — Inauguration Day — but mostly symbolic — such as Presidents’ Day or Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Opening Day is both. It’s practical, in that there’s a very tangible reason to give the country a day off: There’s a ballgame to watch. But it’s also deeply meaningful. One need not be a baseball fanatic to appreciate the importance or novelty in taking one day in early spring each year and getting outdoors, enjoying life, spending time with family and friends and celebrating a pastime older than “God Bless America,” 23 states and the Washington Monument.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Undoubtedly, some will say that this is hardly what Congress should concern itself with these days. To them, I say: Doesn’t it seem like the country needs some unification and common ground right now? And how better to find that than baseball?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Not that this should become an urgent legislative priority, of course — spend a few days, whip some votes and see what you can do. I will admit that I’m a complete stranger to the politics of federal holidays, but, at the very least, I’m sure the Freedom Caucus has some kind of objection.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But objections can be worked out. That’s the beauty of baseball. There’s no baseball beef in the world that can’t be solved over a hot dog and a beer, cracker jacks if you’re up to it. And it’s for that same reason that right now, Opening Day is just the holiday we need.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Steve Jobs once said, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/movie/steve-jobs-the-lost-interview/id632407040">“Everyone should learn how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.” </a>I imagine when he first made this claim in 1995, it was met with laughs and eye-rolls. The reaction today would likely be different: Now, more and more people are treating rudimentary programming as a basic skill.</p>
<p class="p3">Just this week, the New York Times ran a story titled, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/education/edlife/where-non-techies-computer-programming-coding.html?ref=edlife">“Where Non-Techies Can Get with Programming.”</a> It describes programming as the “lingua franca of the modern economy,” a tool that can be used to improve productivity in almost any field. The article paints a startling picture of the pervasive role of computer science in the job market — one that should be an eye-opener for all students thinking about developing employable skills. But as we move forward in the age of technology, it is not just students that need to think strategically about learning computer science — universities need to reconsider their curricula too.</p>
<p class="p3">In the last decade, an increasing number of fields, from journalism to consulting, are becoming computational in nature. Many job postings in industries unrelated to technology now list proficiency in languages like Java as a requirement or preferred skill. Ten years from now, Python and C++ might well become the next Microsoft Office. And even if this isn’t the case, it is indisputable that computing skills have become increasingly valuable in recent years.</p>
<p class="p3">Sensing this trend, over 50 percent of college students are now enrolling in at least <a href="http://tech.co/college-students-take-computer-science-2015-06">one computer science class</a>. At Brown, enrollment in computer science courses doubled between <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/10/11/computer-science-enrollment-doubles-since-2005/">2005 and 2013</a>. CSCI 0150: “Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Computer Science” is one of the most popular courses every fall, regularly filling up Salomon 101. But even the most basic computer science courses are notorious for being time-consuming and challenging for the uninitiated and uninterested; they are not ideal for students who only want to pick up the basics of computing and apply them to other disciplines.</p>
<p class="p3">This dilemma was something I struggled with for the last few months. As a public policy concentrator, I had little interest in intense programming. But with the rise of data-driven policymaking, jobs in government and policy are increasingly relying on computing skills. I wanted to learn the basic tools so I could apply them in policy or political journalism contexts, but I didn’t know where to look. In the last few months, I have met many other students facing similar struggles.</p>
<p class="p3">So this leaves universities with a pressing question: How should they integrate programming and data science into the curriculum so that students are prepared to enter the competitive and increasingly tech-oriented job market? And how can they achieve this without compromising other skill sets and promoting a diverse array of interests?</p>
<p class="p3">Some undergraduate programs, like Harvey Mudd College, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ran-libeskindhadas/every-college-student-sho_b_7192700.html">now have mandatory CS courses for the entire student body</a>. While this model could work in other schools, it does not align with the open curriculum and admirable emphasis on academic freedom. Yet, as industries gradually adapt to the onset of the Information Age, it is time universities like Brown follow suit.</p>
<p class="p3">Brown has already made a start by offering courses like CSCI 0030: “Introduction to Computation for the Humanities and Social Sciences” and CSCI 0040: “Introduction to Scientific Computing and Problem Solving.” These courses use computing tools to tackle real-world problems in a range of other disciplines. Other departments have also developed courses that hone programming skills in other contexts, including ECON 1660: “Big Data” and LITR 0110D: “Digital Language Art I.” I would love to see other departments continue this trend and create computing-oriented courses that are specifically targeted toward other fields and require no programming experience.</p>
<p class="p3">At the same time, students — particularly those in the humanities and social sciences — should consider taking at least one computing course during their time at Brown. It might not be the most fun or casual elective, but it will probably be one of the most useful. And with the sheer variety of programming courses geared toward other disciplines (with hopefully more on the way), there is something for almost everyone out there.</p>
<p class="p3">Last year, former President Barack Obama declared that computer science is <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2016/01/white_house_computer_science_for_all_initiative.html">“a basic skill, right along with the three R’s”</a> — reading, writing and arithmetic. I don’t think that statement is true yet, but in another decade or two, it probably will be. So it is time for both departments and students to stop treating computer science as a niche skill. It is all around us, and it is here to stay. We need to make sure we’re not left behind.</p>

		<title>Liang &#039;19: Anonymous confession pages dilute campus conversation</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/09/draft-liang-column/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This spring, a wave of potential future first-years will excitedly join Brown’s online community. The Facebook group “Brown University Class of 2021 - Admitted Students” will be their gateway social media drug, with “likes” and “follows” of other groups not far behind. Along the way, some will inevitably wander into the many anonymous confession and submission pages that current students populate. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Brown Bears Confessions, Brown University Class Confessions, Brown University Confessions, Brown Bears Admirers, Brown University Memes and Brown Dank Stash of Memes for Unproductive Teens (a personal favorite of mine): Each group occupies a unique niche and attracts a certain following from students. Brown Class Confessions, for example, presents itself as representing “the unique experiences, problems and insight of people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.” Brown Bears Admirers is, in the words of a friend, a “true cesspit of thirst.” All of these pages feature anonymity and student-run administrative control. The results range from vitriol and online debates to hilarity and yes, thirst. Some of the Brown groups are better than others. The Brown Bears Admirers page, thanks to its focus on content and tip-top administrative work, is cute and pretty much harmless. Other general confession pages, on the other hand, post everything from the mundane to the downright discriminatory, and we should be weary of these<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>unproductive conversations that can be fostered by anonymous pages like these.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anonymity has always been a touchy subject in the virtual world, and it often leads to the most controversial content. Yik Yak, an anonymous forum specifically for college students, was all the rage a while back, until its creators realized the harm it was causing on campuses and beyond; app users are now tagged to personalized IDs to prevent abusive cyberbullying. Research shows that people tend to be meaner when they get to hide <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2013.813194">behind a virtual mask</a>; combine this with a character limit, and you’ve got a recipe for toxicity. That’s not even the furthest end of the spectrum: Reddit’s 4chan and Tumblr — usually thought of as occupying opposite ends of the political spectrum ­— are both rooted in anonymous commentary and often bring out the trolls from their dark hiding spots, emboldened by anonymity. I can’t imagine how many of them have posted in Brown’s online community, but I think there are at least a few.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One thing is certain: These anonymous pages, almost ubiquitous on college campuses nationwide, aren’t going anywhere. As the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/education/edlife/campus-confessions-pages-are-on-the-rise.html">reported</a>, they’re actually getting more popular. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I understand where some of these groups may be coming from: Anonymity can be used to bring light to important issues that aren’t covered in the mainstream, as seen with Brown Class Confessions. If done right, they can give a microphone to people who might not normally get a voice. But what I’ve also been seeing recently is a lot of in-fighting and bickering in the confession pages. Anonymous responses are published to anonymous posts, followed by personal call-outs and complaints. This kind of online debate is not productive, anonymous or not. These pages are becoming a central way that we communicate with other students outside our normal friend groups, and that’s a problem.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s also a deeper issue to think about when we consider the politics of the anonymous internet: Anonymous submission boards run the risk of normalizing what kind of content we believe should be shameful or hidden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anonymity is powerful, but it is also counter to progress. Are posts about mental health, financial destitution or political ideas only meaningful if confessed or secretly shared? As one poster in Brown Class Confessions wrote: “I hate that I voice my thoughts and feelings on this anonymous page more comfortably than the real people who I’ve been living with for years.” Reading a Facebook page can make us more attuned to the socioeconomic problems on campus, but it also deprives low-income students of a tangible presence because they’ve become this anonymous idea. We “like” in solidarity, but in the end, confessions just become more posts swept down in a nearly endless scroll on our screens. These issues need to be solidified and debated in a better forum so the University can become better attuned to fixing them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should work on taking the most important content and using it to develop real face-to-face conversations and solutions. These pages and their contributors need to engage in more meaningful ways, not only with the students that frequent the spaces, but also with those who don’t, like the administration and general public. We also need to double down and consider what this media is good for and what it will always fail to do. Otherwise, we risk cementing in our minds that some topics really only should be talked about anonymously. And that would be a shame.</span></p>

		<title>Johnson ’19: A more diverse Spring Weekend</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Spring Weekend, the entire Main Green grumbled of lip syncing and poor vocals. Fetty Wap disappointed students who needed a solid chorus to stabilize their swaying mass. This year, we can hope for stronger performances. But our student body, even in its spring stupor, craves more than just musical capability. We care about the artist behind the voice and what she represents. We care about who we see elevated on stage. Spring Weekend is not only a chance to relax to the soundtrack of great artists but also an opportunity to celebrate diversity, one of music’s many gifts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the music industry, diversity is still a major concern. The corporate distributing world faces the same social barriers that run through almost every other industry. A 2016 U.K. study found that women make up only <a href="http://www.ukmusic.org/equality-diversity/uk-music-diversity-taskforce-workforce-diversity-survey-2016/">30 percent of top music industry executives</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Likewise, black, Asian and ethnic minority groups make up around 20 percent of entry-level jobs in the industry. That number <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/09/upper-reaches-of-music-industry-a-mans-world-diversity-study-finds">drops by half </a>when looking up the executive ladder. The music world is also <a href="http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/can-music-industry-tackle-diversity-problem/">not an exception</a> to gender and racial pay gaps. At the performance level, the 2015 Billboard Hot 100 list hit a record low in diversity the same year artists boycotted the Grammys for the overwhelmingly white list of nominees. And in 2013, <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/black-artists-top-singles-chart-2013/">not a single black artist </a>earned a No. 1 Hot 100 single.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In our microcosm here on campus, we can hold the industry to a higher standard. The Brown Concert Agency has the ability to conscientiously feature diverse voices. Of course, there is no lack of talent in any demographic, so the BCA can prioritize diversity and inclusion in their choices without compromising musical integrity. Each spring carries the potential for challenging our whitewashed pop culture. Spring Weekend lineups have progressively become more diverse, leading to the fantastic lineup this year. This year’s program features three solo-act women of color — Princess Nokia, Empress Of and Erykah Badu. Princess Nokia is a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/explore-princess-nokias-feminist-dream-paradise-in-her-new-music-video-815">vocal advocate</a> for the queer community, and her song “Young Girls” was called a “feminist paradise” with its female Utopian music video. <a href="http://www.flaunt.com/content/music/cherry-glazerr">Cherry Glazerr</a> are self-proclaimed feminists who do not follow gender norms, and with their description of female friendships as “beautiful and intense,” they complement Princess Nokia’s music. And Young Thug defies the hypermasculinity often perpetuated by male rappers — in his 2016 Calvin Klein campaign, he <a href="http://www.complex.com/style/2016/07/young-thug-says-there-is-no-such-thing-as-gender">said</a> “there’s no such thing as gender.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This year’s lineup demonstrates an increased attention to diversity in music. Ten years ago, the Saturday concert featured <a href="http://www.setlist.fm/festival/2007/brown-spring-weekend-2007-4bd667c6.html">four bands</a>, none of which reflected the diversity of our student body and nation. The Saturday set list five years ago was more diverse, but still <a href="http://www.setlist.fm/festival/2012/brown-spring-weekend-2012-63d66667.html">fell short </a>of showcasing a range of different voices and perspectives. This improvement is not just true of Brown: Across the Ivy League, spring concerts have grown more inclusive. While this year’s Slope Day at Cornell is overwhelmingly white, Princeton Lawnparties exclusively features black hip hop artists and rappers and Columbia’s Bacchanal features Mykki Blanco, an artist who identifies as transfeminine. Our student bodies are pushing for inclusion, and spring concerts are making progress.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a period when the University is investing millions to support diversity and inclusion, the lineup for this year’s Spring Weekend offers a timely signal of the campus commitment to these ideals. The BCA’s choices shows that student action can catalyze progress in all spheres of campus life. The lineup exposes more students to diverse artists, providing a space for students to make memories with musical styles they might not listen to themselves. Moreover, the BCA is bringing more attention to these deserving performers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not only does this year’s lineup feature more artists of color and gender non-conforming artists, it features more genre-bending artists. Erykah Badu is a rapper, singer and dancer, crossing borders between performance types. Aluna Francis and George Reid quite literally fused names and styles to become AlunaGeorge. Princess Nokia fuses hip hop and rap while incorporating her Puerto Rican and Taino heritage. The lineup all together is an innovative melange of artists who defy simple categorization in identity and genre. We are guaranteed two entire days free of labels and boxes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And on Spring Weekend later this month, we will be immersed in that liberating environment. Even without understanding hip hop history or particularly liking rap as a genre, a diverse and inclusive space lets us learn. Exposure to different musical styles is one more way to expand our understanding of different perspectives. Thank you in advance, BCA, for this celebration.</span></p>

		<title>Miller &#039;19: When politics are in (Teen) Vogue</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/miller-19-politics-teen-vogue/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bright magentas, canary yellows and cerulean blues that line the pages of Teen Vogue present a glossy tableau of the latest in fashion, color and style. Yet, Vogue’s younger sibling has begun to emerge from its cocoon of teen bliss. Since 2016, two new monochrome colors have spread over its pages. Today, sophisticated columns in black and white challenge teens to confront and expand their views. Despite criticism, Teen Vogue’s political coverage plays an important part in the broader political and feminist discussion of our time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Upon its creation in 2003, Teen Vogue’s founding editor-in-chief Amy Astley described its mission to the New York Times:<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/12/teen-vogue-politics/510374/"> “We are going to do what we do well, which is fashion, beauty and style.” </a>For many years, the magazine stuck to that formula, focusing primarily on clothing, makeup tips and interviews with celebrity heartthrobs. But, after a 2016 editorial shake-up led to the promotion of Elaine Welteroth, the youngest and second African-American Condé Nast editor, Teen Vogue amended its mission to include providing sophisticated yet readable commentary on a broad range of social and political topics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most famously, Lauren Duca’s article in the Dec. 10 issue, <a href="http://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-is-gaslighting-america">“Donald Trump is Gaslighting America,”</a> likened President Trump to a psychological abuser targeting the American people. The article garnered <a href="http://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-is-gaslighting-america?">30,000 retweets</a>, including some from journalists on National Public Radio and CBS News. Duca was then invited on Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s show, where he berated her for covering both politics and fashion: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/12/28/tucker-carlson-delivers-sexism-for-fox-news/?utm_term=.f67fbc729d44">“You should stick to the thigh-high boots … You’re better at that.”</a> These comments, deeply sexist and uninformed, echo the sentiments of many others who believe women and their magazines should stick to traditional “women’s” topics, such as beauty and fashion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are many critiques levelled at Teen Vogue’s change in focus. Some are already clamoring that Teen Vogue’s activist bent is “brainwashing” malleable adolescents in the midst of formulating their own political views before reaching voting age. Others criticize the juxtaposition of articles entitled “The Syrian Town That Was Chemically Attacked Was Just Bombed Again” and “Selena Gomez and The Weeknd Just Became Instagram Official,” arguing that the contrast may seem inappropriate in a fashion journal for teens and inadvertently trivialize serious issues. Many fear that the teens reading these commentary pieces cannot discern the difference between an op-ed and an news story aimed at objectivity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet, all of these criticisms miss a fundamental fact: Teens nowadays have to navigate through an extremely politicized landscape. It is nearly impossible to escape politics and current events, and Teen Vogue is only providing its readers with the tools to better understand systemic issues. Teenagers will undoubtably play a vital role in future election cycles — 50 percent of eligible young voters between the ages of 18 and 24, or about 24 million youths, voted in the 2016 election. By 2020, <a href="http://civicyouth.org/quick-facts/youth-voting/">many of Teen Vogue’s readers will be of voting age</a>, and they must be ready to make informed political decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Teen Vogue’s decision is especially admirable when placed in the broader context of women and teenagers in politics. It should not be surprising that a magazine known for promoting celebrity fashion to young readers is seen by many as incompatible with a serious journal. In part, this reflects the antiquated view that teens and women are not, and should not be, interested in politics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But these notions were the very same ones used to undermine women’s empowerment in the twentieth century. Just as we have largely acknowledged that women have a major role to play in this country, we should realize that the same applies to teens.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In that respect, Teen Vogue’s stand is indicative of a wider trend encouraging teens to be informed and contributing citizens. Teen Vogue’s digital editor Phillip Picardi affirms this view: “I think young people, and perhaps particularly young women are so wildly underestimated by the world at large, and I want us to be a platform that challenges that idea.” Teen Vogue sees itself as providing a platform for its readers to gain a stronger voice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just as we must view Teen Vogue as more than just a fashion magazine, we should see its readers as informed political citizens hoping to educate themselves further on contemporary political issues and actively contribute to today’s complex narratives. But Teen Vogue’s editorial board must maintain vigilant oversight. As a start, the magazine should more clearly delineate its political opinion sections from glamour ideas, so that they do not underplay major issues. As long as Teen Vogue continues to use credible sources and produce relevant and thoughtful political content, it will serve as a powerful new tool to engage a nascent group of readers. Let’s take Teen Vogue’s new breadth as a serious opportunity to educate our next generation of teens.</span></p>

		<title>Cardoso ’19: The precarious state of Brazilian democracy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This past week, Eduardo da Cunha, the former president of Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies — the lower house of its national legislature — was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39442005">sentenced</a> to 15 years in prison after he was convicted on corruption charges relating to his involvement in Brazil’s gargantuan grafting scandal, Operation Lava Jato (translated as Operation Car Wash). This fitting conclusion to da Cunha’s sensational fall from power provided an almost surreal context for former President Dilma Rousseff’s Monday lecture “The Challenges for Democracy in Brazil.” Indeed, it was da Cunha that accused Rousseff of malfeasance in the first place, having instigated the impeachment <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/eduardo-cunha-brazilian-politician-impeachment-dilma-rousseff-expelled">proceedings</a> against her in late 2015. His conviction almost immediately prior to Rousseff’s lecture, though, is not just a humorous bit of irony — rather, it portends dark things for the health of Brazil’s relatively nascent democracy.</p>
<p class="p2">To the casual observer, Rousseff’s cries of a “political coup” may have seemed like sour grapes — the bitter rationalizations of a politician seeking to vilify her opponents and protect the legacy of her party. But upon deeper inspection, there is really no clearer way to describe her ouster than as an institutional coup d’etat based entirely in political factionalism.</p>
<p class="p2">Firstly, Rousseff found herself among the very few of Brazil’s political elite that were not implicated in Operation Lava Jato, which involved breathtaking corruption and grafting through Brazil’s state-owned oil company, Petrobras. As a result, the investigation of politicians implicated in the scandal proceeded, unabated, under her watch. While many in Rousseff’s own party have been implicated in the scandal, including her predecessor and mentor Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, her political opponents have made it clear that they intended to impeach her so that her vice president, Michel Temer — a member of another political party and under investigation himself — could put an end to the probe, saving himself and most of the others implicated. Indeed, in the Chamber of Deputies, 303 of its 513 members were under investigation for corruption, as were 49 members of the 81-member Senate. Of the 65 members on the impeachment commission in the Chamber of Deputies, 38 voted to impeach Rousseff, and of those, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-brazil-impeach-20160328-story.html">37</a> were under investigation for charges related to the Lava Jato scandal.</p>
<p class="p2">In case their voting patterns did not signal their intent clearly enough, some members of President Temer’s cabinet have elucidated their motivations. Senator Romero Jucá, president of Temer’s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/brazil-minister-romero-juca-quits-leaked-call-160524060204543.html">caught</a> on tape suggesting to Sérgio Machado, the former president of the Brazilian oil and transportation conglomerate Transpetro, that “a change in government” would result in an agreement to “staunch the bleeding” posed by <a href="https://www.financierworldwide.com/recent-corruption-scandals-in-brazil-and-anti-corruption-compliance-trends-for-2015/#.WO1gD9LytPY">Operation</a> Lava Jato, in which both were implicated.</p>
<p class="p2">With this in mind, Rousseff’s <a href="https://www.publico.pt/2016/08/29/mundo/noticia/estamos-a-um-passo-do-golpe-de-estado-diz-dilma-1742597">claim</a> that Brazil was “one step from an actual coup” no longer seems like hyperbole. But while her impeachment was, by any metric, profoundly and disturbingly anti-democratic, the aftermath of her departure presents problems of its own.</p>
<p class="p2">Rousseff’s Workers’ Party has ruled without interruption since 2003, when da Silva was first elected. The Workers’ Party has implemented and run on extensive social welfare programs which have been credited with helping to significantly reduce extreme poverty, hunger and HIV rates in Brazil. It was on this platform that Rousseff was reelected in 2014. However, her successor, Temer — who is not a member of Rousseff’s party and is, unbelievably, currently banned from <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2016/08/brazil-dilma-impeachment-case-study-hypocrisy-160812113243389.html">running for president</a>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>despite ascending to the position as Rousseff’s vice president — has begun to implement <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/13/brazil-approves-social-spending-freeze-austerity-package">severe austerity</a> measures. This is all in spite of the fact that Rousseff ran on exactly the opposite platform. Following the Senate’s approval of his budgetary amendment, which caps federal spending for the next 20 years, protests <a href="http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/movimentos-sociais-protestam-contra-a-pec-do-teto-na-av-paulista.ghtml">erupted</a> across Brazil. Shockingly, even members of his own party have called for his resignation. Ronaldo Caiado, a leader of Temer’s political coalition, stated publicly that he should <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/world/americas/brazil-protests-senate-austerity-michel-temer.html">resign</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">While reasonable people can certainly disagree over the wisdom and efficacy of Rousseff’s policies and even her decisions, which, in fact, were fairly divisive in Brazil, it seems indisputable that her impeachment was a product of corruption and political tribalism. Rousseff’s lecture was aptly named — Brazil’s democracy faces several sinister challenges, indeed.</p>

		<title>Bornstein ’18: Don’t honk if you support equality</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/bornstein-18-dont-honk-support-equality/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Eat a hamburger!” “You girls just made my day!” “Put a shirt on, pervert!” “I can see your cootch through your shorts!” These remarks and many more salacious ones have been directed at me and my teammates on the women’s cross-country team — often accompanied by wolf whistles, honking and leering out the car window. Once a driver even touched himself as he idled alongside my teammate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In my day-to-day life, I have not yet felt the direct impact of women being paid 80 cents on the dollar. Never in the classroom or the workplace have I been made to feel inferior because of my sex. Only when I am running do I feel unequal — frustrated that I cannot run after dark or on a wooded trail alone. My neck is getting pretty sore from looking over my shoulder for 65 miles a week.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Getting catcalled can ruin my whole run,” says Alexis Van Pernis ’18, a middle-distance runner. “In a group, it matters less because we’ll often laugh it off and take comfort in the fact that there’s strength in numbers, but when I’m running alone, it makes me very aware of how vulnerable I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The past 50 years have revolutionized athletic equality for women. In <a href="http://running.competitor.com/2017/03/news/kathrine-switzer-return-boston-marathon_162927">1967</a>, one of the first female finishers of the Boston Marathon had to fight off the race director who tried to rip her number off once they saw a woman on the course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Five years later, Title IX outlawed discrimination on the basis of sex in “any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance,” especially athletics.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Despite these strides for female athletes, sexually-aggressive language needs to be placed higher on the agenda of women’s issues — for athletes and non-athletes alike. This behavior, which in the past has been normalized as “locker room talk,” has moved from the shower room to the campaign trail to the White House. It may just be anecdotal, but my teammates and I have noted that the frequency of verbal attacks has risen along with President Trump’s political status and the media coverage of his misogynistic comments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These trends galvanized the women’s marches in Washington, New York Boston and dozens of other cities this January. But we need to do more than stand in solidarity on Beacon Hill and cheer on Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, as my teammates and I did. We in the crowd were just preaching to the choir — one that doesn’t ogle at women in sports bras. Media coverage of the unprecedented turnout at the marches masked the need for policies to protect women when we do not have strength in numbers. We have been taught to keep our wits about us, to counter these offenses with silence because retorting or approaching the heckler could easily escalate the verbal abuse into a physical altercation. The lack of a political or personal voice for women’s safety leaves us without recourse in these daily assaults. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The National Organization for Women’s top issues include reproductive rights and justice, economic justice and ending violence against women. But even the latter is focused on domestic and sexual violence, not its verbal and gestural precursors. This issue is particularly salient for those whose day-to-day travel and activities take them down unpopulated routes and make them feel unsafe. This past summer, three women were killed mid-run; while random homicide is very uncommon, fear of it is not. According to a survey conducted by Runner’s World magazine, <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/running-while-female">43</a> percent of women experience harassment while running, compared to only 4 percent of men.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The long-term solution could be donating to organizations, like NOW or Emily’s List, so that more women who understand this plight can be elected to Congress and enact legislation to promote gender equality. But if the Equal Rights Amendment wasn’t passed under former President Jimmy Carter, I doubt it can succeed under Trump. And even a federal amendment stating that “equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged … on account of sex” would be powerless against these anonymous, day-to-day harassments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For now, we need a grassroots solution — one that starts with America’s schoolchildren. Sexual respect must be taught alongside sexual education as early as elementary school. Young adults should learn to differentiate between a compliment and a lewd remark — even if their president cannot. Sexual harassment is of course inherently about sex. But at a deeper level, it is about boundaries, respect and feeling safe where we live, work and run. Studies in the United States and abroad have <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/spring-fever/">demonstrated</a> that teaching physical boundaries at all levels of schooling can ingrain a sense of sexual respect that continues into adulthood. Comprehensive and accurate sex education programs that teach the importance of consent, communication and respect equip students with the tools and confidence to discern what <a href="https://www.coe.int/t/dg3/children/1in5/Source/PublicationSexualViolence/Gordon.pdf">constitutes</a> harassment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thus far, sexual education is only <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-policies-on-sex-education-in-schools.aspx">required</a> in 24 states and Washington, in varying levels of detail and adherence to “medical accuracy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Similarly, only half of all states require any kind of sexual assault education in schools, often leaving it up to the parents or relying on lessons in female self-defense — this policy only normalizes these incidents. U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-VA, summed up the cursory approach by <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/08/09/487497208/to-prevent-sexual-assault-schools-and-parents-start-lessons-early">saying</a> “there’s a traditional skittishness about sex education in the K-12 system.” But even the most limited sex education programs may find it more comfortable to teach the importance of respectful, safe interactions with strangers on the street, than those with intimate partners in the bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many of us heard of the language of consent for the first time our freshman year at Brown. Colleges across the country have now taken up the call of consent — but the middle school boys leering out the school bus window won’t receive this talk for five more years, if at all, and that might be too late. It might be too much to ask our current state legislatures to mandate teaching consent in middle or high school, but it shouldn’t be too onerous for educators to reinforce the elementary school adage, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.”</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer shocked the country Tuesday by downplaying Hitler’s use of chemical weapons during the Holocaust and referring to Nazi concentration camps as “Holocaust centers.” Though he later attempted to backtrack on his comments, it is disconcerting to hear the official mouthpiece of the Trump administration engage in Holocaust denial. In light of reports that 100 gay men have been sent to prison camps in Chechnya, Russia — remember, homosexuals were persecuted alongside Jews and other minorities during the Holocaust — there is reason to fear that history is repeating itself in the worst possible way. These alarming developments highlight the challenges associated with, but also the urgency of, maintaining a robust collective memory.</span></p>
<p class="p3">I’ve been thinking a lot about memory lately, in particular the differences between individual and collective memory. My grandmother passed away over spring break. Overnight, she was transformed from a person I could call and chat with into someone whom I could only access through my memories. This change had a strange effect: In my mind, my grandmother was now defined by everything I had ever experienced with her or known about her. Rather than interacting with a single version of her in the present, I pictured in my mind each of her past versions, all rolled into one. Reflecting upon everything she had accomplished over the course of her life, I came to admire her and miss her more than I could have imagined based on any one moment while she was still alive. By remembering my grandmother, I have kept her as a vivid and important part of my life.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since I’ll be graduating in just over a month, I am confronted with a rush of memories from my time as an undergraduate. Many come from my two study abroad experiences, which I look back on as some of the highlights of my time in college. As an undergraduate study abroad peer advisor in the Office of International Programs, I often recount stories of my junior fall semester in Paris to students interested in applying for the program. But as time passes and the distance between then and now widens (I haven’t been in Paris since January 2016), I feel a growing anxiety about the validity of my memory. All of the details that I treasure from that period of my life — the streets I walked, the food I ate, the people I met — grow increasingly blurry. Occasionally, I find myself wondering if I really spent five months in Paris. The only evidence that I did are a few documents and photographs, my memories and the memories of those who were around me.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If my individual memory can grow fainter after just a few months, then it is no wonder that the collective memory of society is so weak. More than 70 years after the end of World War II, the number of Holocaust survivors dwindles with each passing day. Certainly, their individual memories of that terrifying time remain strong even despite their old age. I still remember sharply the night of the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, which affected me only in that I was in the city at the time. I can only imagine what it means to remember living through the torturous experience of the concentration camps and losing family members to the genocide carried out by Hitler and his cruelest of regimes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Without the testimony of these survivors to inform today’s society of what happened in the past, how can we hold ourselves — and our leaders — accountable to keep the Holocaust and other historical wrongdoings in clear view? On Sunday, two days before Spicer’s comments, far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen denied France’s responsibility for the arrest of nearly 13,000 Jews in the Vel d’Hiv roundup of 1942. This denial contradicts both historical evidence and official French government policy, but none of that mattered to her supporters. Just as we have seen lies presented as “alternative facts,” revisionist history represents a clear and present danger to the prevention of future injustices. We must remain vigilant in setting the record straight over and over again: Millions of Jews and other minorities during World War II were taken to death camps, not “Holocaust centers,” and the French government did indeed play a central role in collaborating with the Nazis’ murderous campaign.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To ensure that the Holocaust is never repeated, we must strive to make collective memory as powerful as individual memory. The challenge is to incorporate the history of society into each person’s conception of their own past — even if that history happened decades before we were born. By educating ourselves about the Holocaust through history classes, Anne Frank’s “The Diary of a Young Girl,” films and museums, the women and men who perished at the hands of Hitler can be transformed into members of our own family. In turn, their lives and deaths can become almost as valuable to us as those of our own grandmothers and grandfathers. Such an undertaking requires a huge amount of energy and empathy. But at a time when we find ourselves teetering on the precipice between remembering and forgetting, we must push ourselves to hold onto the past as if our lives depend on it.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Before I left to study abroad in Granada, Spain, the Office of International Programs stressed the social and cultural differences that exist overseas. At the time, I figured the most significant differences I would observe would be regional holidays and specific dialects, which I could quickly learn and pick up. But when I arrived, I learned there were some distinct attitudes and practices that were not as easy to adapt to.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As a Brown student, I came to study abroad in Spain with a certain set of values surrounding the importance of diversity, respect for cultural differences and tolerance for all types of individual identities. But after spending a few months out of the College Hill bubble, I’ve learned that while such values exist in universities abroad, they are not always expressed in the same way as they are at Brown — especially because there is less racial and class diversity in some study abroad institutions, including my own. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This seems to be most apparent in terms of colloquial phrasing. In my anthropology class, when learning about Chinese medicine, my professor’s PowerPoint included a slide that described a Chinese emperor using terminology that I found completely offensive. Shocked and disgusted, I looked around the room to see how the other students were reacting. To my surprise, no one reacted to this phrasing, and the class continued as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This put me in a difficult situation, because if I pointed out the charged implications of the term, I risked overstepping the authority of the professor and asserting my own values over hers. At the same time, if I said nothing, I would miss out on bringing awareness to how the term cou</span>ld be seen as disrespectful.</p>
<p class="p3">I ended up talking to the professor after class, and she told me the phrase in question was meant to be interpreted differently in Spanish, providing me with a somewhat unconvincing explanation. This incident made me consider the ethical quandaries faced by Brown students studying in countries where perceived attitudes, in and out of host institutions, do not necessarily align with the values inculcated at Brown. As Brown students, is it our responsibility to prevent the perpetuation of stereotypes abroad? And if it is, how can we go about doing so while being mindful of the local context and without straying into ethnocentrism?</p>
<p class="p3">It seems ironic to be discussing diversity and tolerance abroad while the world’s eyes are on the Trump administration as the United States grapples with what those values mean at our own doorstep. Throughout my time in Spain, U.S. politics have drifted into many of my interactions with others. I can think of several cases where locals I have interacted with aggressively asserted their political views about President Trump and American politics. Here, I found it particularly difficult to navigate the situation because on the one hand, I wanted to be open to perspectives and hear the other party out, but on the other hand, they were not being open or receptive to my ideas about my own country. Again, I struggled to strike a balance between my own views, developed over a lifetime of American citizenship and three years at Brown, and the views of my hosts, whose experiences require open-mindedness to understand.</p>
<p class="p3">Ultimately, my goal is not to generalize these personal experiences to Spain, Europe or study abroad programs as a whole. Students can and should make an effort to learn from the values and attitudes prevalent in other countries — that is, after all, why we decide to study abroad. But away from the Brown bubble, students abroad can face unique ethical tensions regarding the place of our values and how they are expressed on a global scale.</p>
<p class="p3">When studying abroad, we need to bear in mind our position of privilege as Brown students and our relative ignorance of values in local contexts. That said, we also can’t abandon or set aside the values and critical analyses we spend years developing at Brown. We shouldn’t shy away from engaging in two-sided conversations about our co<span class="s1">ncerns and beliefs, because learning from each other is the only way to correct many persistent misconceptions, even our own. There could be tension in balancing these principles — as in my case — but that is simply part and parcel of living and learning abroad.</span></p>

		<title>Klein ’20: How to fix the NBA’s losing problem</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of every NBA season, the inevitable discussion surrounding the tactic of “tanking” emerges. For those who are unaware, NBA teams with no hope of reaching the playoffs “tank” — lose games on purpose — in order to secure a better position in the NBA draft lottery. The flawed lottery system, in which the worse a team’s record is, the higher its chance of getting a top pick, creates this phenomenon. The team with the worst record in the league has a 25 percent chance of getting the number one pick, the second worst team has a 19.9 percent chance, the third worst team has a 15.6 percent chance and so on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem with this system is that once a team knows they have no hope of reaching the playoffs, they will begin to tank. Tanking does not mean players playing badly and losing on purpose. Jobs are on the line and players have too much pride and incentive. Teams will rest their better players or hold them out with “injuries,” and bench players will get more playing time so the team’s performance will suffer. For example, the Lakers shut down Timofey Mozgov and Luol Deng on March 15 for the rest of the season, even though both players have massive contracts. The Phoenix Suns, in their Tuesday night game against the Sacramento Kings, played 33-year-old guard Ronnie Price — who averaged 1.0 points per game on .167 percent shooting in 14 games — for 19 minutes. A look around the league’s basement-dwellers reveals similar tactics across the board.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And why wouldn’t teams employ this strategy? The NBA is a star-driven league, and stars are found at the top of the draft. The worst thing to be in the NBA is mediocre. The Oklahoma City Thunder rose to prominence thanks to high draft picks, such as Kevin Durant in 2007, Russell Westbrook in 2008 and James Harden in 2009. Their success would not have been possible without losing first.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the reign of Sam Hinkie as general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, tanking came under fire. Purposefully losing games season after season, Hinkie stockpiled assets above all else. Though the losing eventually cost Hinkie his job, the fruits of his labor have ripened. The 76ers now have the unfairly talented — albeit oft-injured — Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons alongside Rookie of the Year contender Dario Saric and a host of other advantageous pick swaps. Philadelphia is widely considered to have one of the brightest futures of all the current non-playoff teams.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The tactic of tanking puts fans in an awkward position. In many cases, it’s better for their teams to lose, but it is not much fun to root for a tanking team. The Lakers won five consecutive games toward the end of the season — and this upset Lakers fan. Tanking is a no-win situation. The fans don’t get to see their team’s best players, and the joy of short-term victory is tainted by long-term loss. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How can this be fixed? A number of theories have gained attention in recent years. One popular proposal is the “wheel,” in which teams would cycle through a certain series of picks, getting the first pick once every thirty years — thirty teams, thirty picks on the wheel — and one top-six pick every five seasons. The issue with this proposal is that it would be easy for bad teams to lose fans. A team could come in last and not have a top pick for another four seasons. As fans of the Brooklyn Nets know, it’s hard enough to wait two seasons — four would be an eternity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sports personality Bill Simmons popularized another possibility, which he calls the “Entertaining-As-Hell-Tournament,” a single-elimination tournament held after the end of the regular season for the eighth seed in the playoffs. While this certainly is a more exciting and intriguing idea, there are problems with its implementation. Scheduling would be an issue — a week-long tournament held after the regular season and before the playoffs would be a hassle for waiting fans of playoff teams. The biggest issue, though, is that this tournament simply wouldn’t matter very much. The NBA playoffs have less parity than other major sports’ postseasons, since it’s easier for stars to dominate the proceedings. A tournament for the honor of being obliterated in four or five games by the first seed isn’t intriguing enough for this to be sustainable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I suggest a far better option: A tournament among the lottery teams for the first pick. This tournament could run concurrently with the first round of the playoffs, eliminating the long waiting period. Fans would be far more invested in the possibility of taking the first pick, as there is a lot more at stake than a lowly first-round exit. Teams would no longer tank in the regular season, since seeding matters. Imagine the drama of a tournament championship next week — Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets versus Hassan Whiteside of the Miami Heat battling it out to play alongside potential number one pick Markelle Fultz in order to form a title contender.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As long as there’s no more Ronnie Price playing big minutes on a languishing, lackadaisical Suns team in front of a bored arena, it’s a win-win.</span></p>

		<title>Krishnamurthy &#039;19: Better elections for a better UCS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Late last month, the Undergraduate Council of Students announced the winners of its annual elections.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The results were a startling indictment of student-directed democracy at Brown. Five UCS races — for the positions of president, vice president, chair of student activities, chair of student wellness and chair of campus life — <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/24/unopposed-steele-18-ucs-president-akasaka-18-wins-ufb-chair/">went uncontested</a>, while no one at all ran for the chair of academic affairs. And only 22 percent of the student body voted, a precipitous decline from just two years ago, when nearly half of undergraduates cast their ballots. To put this into context, Haiti in 2011 <a href="http://www.idea.int/">mustered a greater proportion of voters</a> — that too, a year after a catastrophic earthquake ravaged the whole country. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thankfully, while this year saw historically low participation in UCS elections, the democratic process doesn’t evaporate overnight. Indeed, it is eminently possible to rejuvenate broad interest in UCS contests and enhance voter turnout — but it will take a dramatic overhaul of the elections process to achieve any meaningful progress. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At first glance, it may seem puritanical to take issue with something as mundane as the bureaucratic configuration of UCS races. Yet democratic participation is the bedrock of student government, which is, in turn, indispensable to the cohesion and contentment of the student body. As early as 1927, school administrators recognized that <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/42834264">“under student government, the student comes to feel that the school is his school, its ideals his ideals.”</a> And the eventual result of student government is a crop of students well-versed in the practice and discourse of self-determination, who can unify their school communities in common cause and facilitate the performance of democracy as adults.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To be clear, the suggestion that UCS elections are in need of substantial reform is not a critique of the students newly elected to lead UCS. By all accounts, they are talented individuals who care deeply about this university and are committed to supporting undergraduate life. But they deserve better than noncompetitive coronations. No self-respecting democratic tradition should capitulate to complacency and accept the indignity of uncontested elections. Studies have demonstrated that candidates without any challengers are more likely to perform poorly as legislators and represent their constituents ineffectively. Further, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/23053266">it becomes impossible for voters</a> to hold incumbents and their policy agendas accountable if there are no alternative candidates to choose from. After all, the biggest threat to democracy isn’t populism or tyranny — it’s apathy, on the part of citizens who don’t care enough to run for office and leaders who don’t do enough to prevent apathetic viewpoints.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To encourage more students to run, UCS ought to implement several core reforms, and lowering the barriers to declaring one’s candidacy should be the priority. According to Article 5.2 of the UCS Elections Code, candidates for UCS must “submit a petition with the signatures of 400 registered undergraduates” — <a href="http://www.brownucs.org/join-ucs/">Undergraduate Finance Board candidates</a> need 250 and aspiring UCS general body members need 100 — <a href="https://ucsbrownuniv.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/section-iii-ucs-election-code1.pdf">“to qualify for the ballot.”</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mandating that interested candidates collect such a large quantity of signatures — even to join the general body of UCS — is entirely counterproductive. Presumably, the whole point of this stipulation is to get candidates to demonstrate their sociability by either tapping into existing networks of friends or meeting new people. But 400 is a big number, and the process of getting that many signatures eventually devolves into rote mindlessness, not useful socializing. And it’s unclear how getting hundreds of people to sign a piece of paper handed to them in the Ratty offers even the slightest indication of a candidate’s commitment to UCS or the Brown community. Besides, petitions that call for specific, feasible actions that garner public attention are most worthwhile — not when they endorse something as nebulous and complicated as a person running for office. For all these reasons, UCS should abolish the petition requirement; it merely rewards potential candidates who have a lot of patience (and free time) without seriously testing their ability to make intellectual or organizational contributions to student life. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Next, UCS should allow more student groups to endorse candidates and get involved in public discussions about candidates’ positions. Currently, all student organizations are permitted to endorse UCS candidates, “with the exception of individual Greek houses” and athletic teams, <a href="http://www.brownucs.org/elections2017/">as the UCS elections webpage notes</a>. I’m no frat boy, but this rule feels strangely undemocratic, considering that UCS often passes legislation that can affect life in Greek houses. Here’s a good example: In 2005, UCS called on the University to regulate and reintroduce beer kegs to campus — a move Greek houses supported — which were banned in 1991. Their defiance was immortalized as the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/02/16/ucs-aims-to-bring-kegs-back-on-campus/">“keg stand.”</a> Nice. Moreover, I’m a little fuzzy as to why athletic teams can’t have collective perspectives on UCS candidates either. What’s the institutional difference — between, say, the baseball team and the debate team — that prohibits the former from issuing an endorsement but allows the latter to do so? And who says student-athletes necessarily can’t have a good reason to endorse candidates? Maybe they prefer UCS representatives who understand their specific experience of juggling various curricular and competitive obligations. That’s a perfectly reasonable position, worthy of encapsulation in an endorsement. We must not forget that the positions taken by UCS can affect all students, no matter their affiliations outside of class. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Finally, UCS should extend the timeline of the elections season. This year’s election lasted eight days. Candidates first got to start campaigning after the candidates’ meeting on March 15; the results of the election were announced on March 23. And the UCS debate happened on March 19, just two days before the voting period began on March 21. These timeframes are much too short for students to understand candidates’ positions, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Restrictive_Appendix_Post-2010.pdf">hear the debate and cast their ballots in a clear-headed, thoughtful fashion</a>. This saturation of election activity in two weeks is all the worse with view to the fact that many students reach the peak of midterm season in the weeks preceding spring break, and students are unable to get meaningfully involved. So that the process of democracy can unfold at a more reasonable pace, UCS seriously ought to spread all these events out, perhaps throughout the whole month of March. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is ultimately the prerogative of UCS to consider reforming well-entrenched bureaucratic mechanisms: I can only recommend solutions; I can’t implement them. But a commitment to reform — to reflect, self-assess and continually seek out a broader audience of undergraduates — is an enduring UCS tradition. And now is the perfect time to build on that past, at a time when the Brown community and the country at large face so many concurrent challenges. Three years ago, former UCS president Todd Harris ’14.5 expressed a similar sentiment. He expressed hope that candidates participating in UCS elections would be able to “make UCS a more general body,” and <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/03/21/students-hope-ucs-election-prioritizes-community-engagement/">“make sure that we’re still bringing folks in and not just making it kind of a closed group.”</a> Fulfilling this vision is a profound, ongoing mission; reforming the elections process is the perfect place to start. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Political discourse has a language problem. Though it’s easier than ever to share ideas and engage in conversation, almost any prolonged discussion about national or global issues will involve some semantic ambiguity and misunderstanding. This is a result of both the newfound ease of sharing language on the Internet and our general affinity for using morally-charged words that we don’t truly understand.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For example, I was recently discussing the merits and weaknesses of consumer capitalism with a friend who was utterly bent on “smashing capitalism” and its reign of tyranny. It took about 20 minutes of debate before we realized that we were basing our arguments on entirely different notions of capitalism. My friend was not using capitalism as a term to describe free markets and the private ownership of productive capital — as I was — but instead to encompass historical injustices and the privileging of certain groups. As soon as we recognized this discrepancy, we were able to find common ground on the important part: the actual policies and worldviews that shape lived experiences.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The entire basis of our dispute was centered on our respective failures to articulate exactly what we meant by capitalism. And though we were ultimately able to push through our conversation and come to a sort of agreement, this was possible only by chance — and a mutual desire to procrastinate and try the bruschetta in the Ivy Room.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In another scenario, we may have well abandoned the conversation altogether, each of us leaving the interaction believing that the other was either misguided or stupefyingly naive. This is the danger of masking our arguments under the banner of complex political and social ideas. If we had simply stated our beliefs about the free market on the one hand, and the moral failures of a Western economic system that relied heavily on exploitation on the other, we may have circumvented disagreement altogether.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This issue is particularly pernicious today. The advent of the Internet and social media allows us to converse with one another on an unprecedented scale and easily circulate complicated, academic terms like “cultural appropriation,” “white privilege” and “Western imperialism.” Moreover, greater access to digital academic literature seems to have allowed intellectual political language to funnel parts of its thesaurus into the vernacular.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But these words — phrases like “capitalism,” “imperialism,” “neo-colonialism” and “privilege” — often mean entirely different things to different people. Moreover, these phrases are often understood to encapsulate specific political convictions, when in reality they are far more nuanced than people often believe.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Does being a proponent of capitalism require that one oppose social services and welfare? Does neo-colonialism describe physical meddling in other countries, or is it capacious enough a term to include international aid and cultural influence? There are no universal answers to these questions, and so their overuse and oversimplification undermines the vigor and sincerity of political debate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Beyond encouraging political polarization and neutering public discourse, this trend has induced political apathy by distancing people from tangible issues, allowing them to camouflage in the comforting shade of intellectual language and jargon without any clear grasp of the arguments behind the words.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Furthermore, these words are too often used as invectives to discredit opposition because of the emotional and moral value they are seen to possess. Much of political language has become moralized in a way that muddies our arguments and the coherence of our discussions. They are often no more substantive than a vapid contention that someone is either “good” or “bad.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If someone is dubbed a “neo-liberal,” for example, this is too often a synonym for having condemnable views about Western intervention. Or if someone else claims that they want to fight against “statism,” this only indicates that they disagree with people who are keen on a large government. In either case, words like “statist” and “neo-liberal” serve as a cheap replacement for an actual, active criticism or argument.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These tendencies have had a pernicious effect on public discourse and genuine political debate. We are removed from the possibility of engaging with one another in a thoughtful way because we talk past each other with imprecise language and the use of complex, loaded and often empty words. This is truly a pity.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That is not, of course, to say that these words do not have an important function. They can be entirely helpful if they are coupled with a mutual understanding of what they mean and how they are being employed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m an optimist when it comes to political discourse. I believe that when all the facts are laid out, the arguments are properly constructed and the words are defined, people will generally be able to reach some sort of common ground. It is essential to use precise language and abandon buzzwords when discussing politics, because doing so can help us reach greater mutual understanding, if not agreement. As political polarization continues to undermine the strength of public discourse, a bit more thought about the catch-all political words we use could go a long way. I think our classes, communities, public spaces and democracy would be better for it.</span></p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To many community members, the Swearer Center for Public Service — home to over 100 student-run community programs — is probably among the lesser-known parts of the University, but its relative obscurity might belie the sweeping implications of its recent reorientation. Last year, the Swearer Center began to implement the provisions of its long-term strategic <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/special-programs/public-service/sites/brown.edu.academics.college.special-programs.public-service/files/uploads/Swearer%20Strategic%20Plan%20FINAL.pdf">plan</a>. The plan places a premium on combining academic learning with community engagement, pairing all Swearer Center programs with relevant “community partners” and establishing long-term relationships between students and the communities they serve. These changes were intended to address pressing concerns that have chronically plagued Swearer Center programs — volunteer turnover, elitism and program redundancy — and the Center should be <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/25/changes-to-swearer-draw-mixed-reactions/">commended</a> for recognizing and seeking to address these issues. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, the broader reorientation is a case study in how not to implement an ambitious reform program. Indeed, Swearer Center administrators have demonstrated an almost cavalier disregard for the effects of their changes on the established programs under their supervision. A lack of transparency, an inflexible commitment to “best practices” and an unwillingness to cooperate with student community fellows have created an atmosphere of anxiety and uncertainty certain to discourage student community engagement. While the purpose of the Swearer Center is to help Brown students engage meaningfully with the Providence and Rhode Island communities as effectively as possible, its patronizing and rigid approach to modernization undermines not only its own objectives but the efforts of the students working in it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perhaps the most glaring issue with the Swearer Center’s efforts so far has been its inflexibility in adopting what it considers “best practices.” These reforms are often well-intentioned and, in fact, seem poised for success with many programs, but the Swearer Center has all but rejected the extenuating circumstances of certain programs that may demand modification or even obviate the need for changes at all. That there is no paucity of examples only underscores the center’s unaccommodating approach to modernization. For example, the Swearer Center has <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/12/swearer-balances-strategic-plan-community-partnerships/">clashed</a> with community fellows over geographically centralizing certain programs — that is, moving the community population to a single location and working with it there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This arrangement may seem logical, but, upon further inspection, actually evinces what is, at best, ignorance of the conditions of the communities served or, at worst, rank classism. Requiring certain community populations to travel to centralized locations is often unworkable and expensive, which makes the program functionally inaccessible. Indeed, as The Herald has <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/swearer-center-strategic-plan-incites-conflict/">reported</a>, this has been the case for certain programs like the Outdoor Leadership Environmental Education Program, whose current model of traveling to the students served, rather than the other way around, leaves both the program and its community partner, the Met High School, content.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even more notoriously, the Swearer Center has demonstrated a similar unwillingness to consider the concerns of the Brown Refugee Youth Tutoring and Enrichment program. The cornerstone of BRYTE’s engagement model is one-on-one, in-home tutoring. Yet, the Swearer Center demanded that they replace this model with a geographically localized model, citing <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/swearer-center-strategic-plan-incites-conflict/">issues</a> like liability and effectiveness. However, this disrupts the pedagogical model of a program that has seen extreme success. Ultimately, the Swearer Center’s obstinance forced BRYTE to seek alternative <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/swearer-center-strategic-plan-incites-conflict/">sponsorship</a>. Fortunately, it has since partnered with the Alpert Medical School, but the Swearer Center’s willingness to abandon its largest tutoring program demonstrates a dangerous and unsettling reluctance to cooperate with its student liaisons.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Equally problematic is the Swearer Center’s willingness to make decisions without consulting student leaders — decisions that frequently pose serious obstacles to programs’ futures. For example, the Swearer Center, in an effort to gradually phase out the current crop of community fellows and replace them with Bonner <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/24/bonner-fellows-carve-new-path-swearer/">fellows</a> — members of a program that trains students in the type of community engagement espoused by Johnson and the Strategic Plan — has instructed several programs to reshape their leadership structures and cut community fellow positions, often with minimal consultation with existing community fellows. This type of opacity alienates students, foments distrust among community fellows and contributes to an atmosphere of anxiety and uncertainty. BRYTE is not alone in experiencing this type of neglect. As a volunteer with the Swearer Tutoring and Enrichment in Math and Sciences program, I’ve been able to observe myself the consequences of this lack of transparency. Budget cuts in fall 2016 have made even the most basic forms of community engagement beyond in-class tutoring, like workshops and holiday parties, impossible. Despite my deep involvement with the program, Swearer Center has neglected to explain to me or my fellow volunteers why the funding has been cut or where it’s been diverted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It goes without saying that this type of reluctance to be transparent is not conducive to a healthy working environment and is profoundly patronizing. Johnson has noted that <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/swearer-center-strategic-plan-incites-conflict/">while</a> the Swearer Center tries to incorporate the voices of students whenever possible, sometimes, “what students want contradicts best practices in the field.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This, however, both is inconsistent with what some community partners have expressed — recall that the Met High School was perfectly content with its arrangement with OLEEP, yet this did not stop the Swearer Center from intervening and does not address the fact that students are often not consulted when these decisions are made the first place.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Actual attempts by the Swearer Center to include student voices in its decision-making process have been hollow and superficial. For example, the Student Advisory Committee, which was established by Johnson following his arrival and is staffed by student participants in Swearer Center programs, is ostensibly charged with assisting the administrators in developing and implementing policy. However, according to several students involved, participation on the committee is wholly futile. As The Herald has reported, committee members have resigned in protest over the SAC’s lack of agency and frustration with the adminstrators’ disregard for the input of its members. Ultimately, rather than providing the Swearer center with a valuable source of student input, the SAC merely highlights the Center’s reluctance to seriously engage with students over what are often legitimate concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">None of this is to say that the Swearer Center’s plans for engaged scholarship or long-term student-community relationships are inherently destructive. The Swearer Center is right to address past problems such as insufficient volunteer commitments and community engagement neophytes trying to independently address community issues without the necessary skills or resources. To oppose these goals is to subscribe to a brand of institutional conservatism that is just as corrosive to the success of Brown’s community engagement as the Swearer Center’s fumbled reform efforts. But the sclerosis of the Swearer Center’s vision for reform and its divisive, alienating approach to implementation will surely continue driving out established programs at the expense of Brown’s volunteers. Perhaps most tragically, its reckless and tone deaf reorientation will ultimately disadvantage the very communities that the Swearer Center claims it assists, and for this, its administrators deserve the harshest opprobrium.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I still visibly flinch when I think about the day after the election. Like many others at Brown, I was simultaneously numb and furious. But the worst moment of the day wasn’t when I heard that former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had unexpectedly lost Florida, or when I saw the New York Times alert on my phone announcing President Trump’s victory, or even when I forced myself to sit through Clinton’s heartbreaking concession speech. It was heading down to the State House that morning for my part-time internship, knowing all the while that our government would never be the same.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That day, for the first time since I arrived in Providence, the sight of the State House dome didn’t fill me with adrenaline; I walked down the historic hallways feeling claustrophobic and disillusioned. The prospect of a government job had lost its charm, and all I wanted to do was run in the other direction. But a couple of hours later, I heard my coworkers comforting each other: “It’s moments like these that remind us why we do what we do. Because in four years, we’re still going to be here and our work is still going to matter.” And then, someone else told me a few days later: “You’re too young to be this jaded. We need our young workers to stay passionate and engaged for the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In the months since the election, these ideas have been echoed time and time again, often as trite platitudes before a barrage of doomsday predictions about the Trump administration. Yet, there was something about these moments — and frankly, my emotional vulnerability in the days following the election — that kept the words at the forefront of my mind.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It might be a cliche, it might be overused, but it is true nonetheless: Now more than ever, it is vital that millennials who care about government and public service find their way into those sectors. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/the-outsiders-how-can-millennials-change-washington-if-they-hate-it/278920/">Evidence</a> suggests that our generation is one of the most service-minded, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/06/28/diversity-defines-the-millennial-generation/">diverse</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/03/24/millennials-are-significantly-more-progressive-than-their-parents/?utm_term=.f009c8037664">progressive</a>. We’re more willing to catalyze large-scale change, and more likely to believe in the importance of government work as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2014/10/08/millennials-like-government-work-but-dont-stay-long-survey-finds/?utm_term=.3fa8788ff855">whole</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, we are also part of the generation least likely to pursue public service. Even before the election of Trump, younger workers were less than thrilled by the prospect of a government-related job. The percentage of the federal workforce under 30 dropped by 7 percent over the course of 2014, resulting in the lowest under-30 federal employment rate in over a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/millennials-exit-the-federal-workforce-as-government-jobs-lose-their-allure/2014/12/15/ea3d4418-7fd4-11e4-9f38-95a187e4c1f7_story.html?utm_term=.17">decade</a>. In <a href="https://dupress.deloitte.com/content/dam/dup-us-en/articles/millennials-in-government-federal-workforce/DUP-1450_Millennials-in-govt_vFINAL_12.2.15.pdf">2015</a>, millennials made up just 24.5 percent of government employees, as opposed to 33.7 percent of the corporate world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More significantly, we simply don’t see <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/allstate/when-it-comes-to-politics-do-millennials-care-about-anything/255/">government</a> as the best venue for substantial change anymore.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is not enough data to assess the federal government’s generational makeup under Trump. Yet, given that just 37 percent of young voters voted for <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/11/21/how-millennials-voted/">Trump</a>, it is safe to say that many millennials who would have pursued jobs in government are having second thoughts. These misgivings actually seem to permeate partisan lines: After conservative experts <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2016/11/young_people_are_rethinking_careers_in_government_service_they_shouldn_t.html">criticized</a> Trump’s credentials during the campaign, many young Republicans are also doubtful about working in the public sector. Trump’s budget cuts could also further reduce millennial employment in all levels of government and government-funded organizations, dissuading many from even considering these <a href="https://policy-perspectives.org/2017/02/16/the-hidden-consequences-of-the-hiring-freeze/">positions</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">These considerations have been prevalent at Brown: Many students are rethinking their entire career plans in light of the election, wondering if they would be able to make a difference in the political arena or if they would just be <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/03/seniors-rethink-careers-due-trump-admin/">complicit</a>. Since November, I have heard many friends — people who have spent years believing they were going to work in politics — articulate how they have given up on government and policy altogether. Now, I can understand wanting to avoid the federal government at all costs: Many of us would find it difficult, if not impossible, to stomach the idea of working under a Trump administration and implementing his capricious <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/04/07/epa-staffer-leaves-with-a-bang-blasting-agency-policies-under-trump/?utm_term=.4c53ccb76aa1">policies</a>. But state and local governments, non-profit organizations, campaigns, research institutions and many others are all contributing in their own way to the movement against regressive policies. Many of them are simultaneously expanding their employee base to respond to the unique challenges of the current presidency. Their work — in a period of unforeseen adversity and frustration — holds the Trump administration accountable and ensures that in four years, the (hopefully) new administration will have the platform and tools to pick up the pieces. We can’t let the skills and experience needed to oversee the reestablishment and growth of progressive policies lapse over the next four years. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Brown students — particularly those concentrating in the social sciences — increasingly re-evaluate their career choices in the wake of the election, it is understandable that the public sector might not hold the appeal that it once did. But we shouldn’t abandon it just yet. There are many other venues to enact governmental change in the long term, and there’s no better time to do it. Progress is, after all, more than just immediate change.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As “Girls” came to a close this Sunday, I couldn’t help but think of the first time Lena Dunham’s unapologetic nakedness graced my screen. While Venus of Urbino may have prompted nervous laughter and blushing the first time I saw it in a high school art history class, my first reaction to Dunham’s nudity was personally revolutionary. Though I was in awe of both nude forms, the latter stirred a reaction that can only be caused by an immediate visceral connection to something. As I watched a protagonist eat cereal in her underwear, brush her teeth without a top and video chat a friend from the toilet, I began to realize how different this show was going to be from any other I had experienced. Dunham’s character, Hannah, was not baring it all on account of preparing to have sex or going skinny-dipping or marching on the streets to make a statement — she was naked because in our lives, sometimes, we do things without clothes on. And from that beginning, I knew the show was going to be ground-breaking in its honesty and rawness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One day, after a lengthy and self-indulgent speech about the importance of an episode centering around Hannah’s three-day affair with a stranger, the unlucky friend subjected to my monologue finally cracked: “Stop overthinking it!” But how could I not? From abortion to addiction, coming-out to career choices: The vast scope of topics covered by “Girls” is paralleled in size only by the quantity of criticism the show has received. Reaching past the blogosphere and into the likes of the New Yorker and the New York Times, the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/white-girls">conversations about the show’s lack of diversity</a>, extent to which Hannah is representative of <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/girls-lena-vs-hannah">Dunham</a> and advancement of feminism — <a href="https://mic.com/articles/23205/lena-dunham-girls-is-white-girl-feminism-at-its-worst#.bKHWL00DZ">or the advancement of white feminism</a> — is everywhere. “Girls” has proven to be something worth “overthinking.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Hannah’s literal nudity in mundane moments was what initially spoke to me, I am primarily left appreciating the characters’ willingness to expose themselves, metaphorically speaking. In baring more than just tattoos and flesh, true nude forms — composed of personality warts and the scars of bad decisions — were exposed in “Girls.” Among the show’s commentary, what has interested me the most is the noted absence of any obviously likable main character. To simplify: Marnie is uptight, Jessa is careless, Shoshana is strange and Hannah is melodramatic. All four are coated with membranes of narcissism that are as impenetrable as they are familiar to us viewers. After years of being primed to latch onto the token smart or charming or perfect heroine of a story laden with admirable men, I left the first few episodes of “Girls” feeling disoriented. Maybe, I thought, I don’t “get” Hannah. Regardless of her personality quirks, she’s probably a good person. Wrong. And that is not to say Hannah is a “bad” person either; rather, the show simply does not work on this binary. Perhaps the argument is that even fictitious lives are far too complicated to fit under a standard of “this or that.” Regardless, the characters vacillate on a continuum, and often the question of general decency is not at the crux of any of the central quartet’s decisions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The truth is, I find “Girls” so easy to identify with because I’m not sure if I would be a likeable protagonist in my own story. Among embodying every unpleasant quality of the “Girls” girls at different moments, I have additional sour attributes that would probably pan out grossly on screen. But the show seems to argue that it’s fine — it’s real — to not be someone that others seek to identify with. Instead, Girls says, live a life of choices where you can identify the you in yourself. This is not an excuse to do whatever you want without regard for others: Instead, the show preaches acting via your own intuition rather than in accordance with a feeling of being watched.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All this said, Dunham’s show will not make it on the list of ones I watch over and over in times of stress (which also happen to be the times when watching TV is the last thing I should be doing). As appalling as this sounds after my lengthy ode, let me explain: While the Office’s jokes and Gossip Girl’s drama will always be as entertaining as they are distracting, the aforementioned sentiments of relatability I find in the “Girls” characters will prevent me from ever re-watching the series for hours on end. This is partially because I would prefer more mindless diversion during finals period when a binge is in order. But mainly, I am confident that I will be graced by reminders of the “Girls” girls for the rest of my time at Brown and afterwards. Being human, we are peculiar and make unwise choices ­— no one is exempt from having moments of being severely unlikable. As one tearful character says to another during the series’ penultimate episode, in a moment that seems to encapsulate the show’s entire premise: “We were all just doing our best.”</span></p>

		<title>Steinman &#039;19: Code can’t cure all</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Pre-roll advertisements on YouTube, the ones that play before your desired video, are generally understood as one of the most annoying types of online advertisement. Sometimes it is because they are disproportionately long for the video you’re trying to watch, or because the advertised product is grossly incongruent with the content of the video, like news coverage of a terrorist attack or natural disaster. Disapproval of pre-roll ads is near universal: It is estimated that 94 percent of viewers click the <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/63277-pre-roll-video-ads-is-it-any-wonder-why-we-hate-them">“skip ad” button</a> when they are given the chance. As such, it feels strange to defend them. But as inconvenient as they are, it is the advertising money that keeps independent YouTube broadcasters afloat. Unlike television advertising, ad placement on YouTube is not determined by the advertisers themselves or by a network, but by an algorithm delivering content to more than a billion users every single day. And on a website whose founding slogan in 2005 was “Broadcast Yourself,” the makeup of that algorithm has dangerous implications for free speech.</p>
<p class="p3">Understanding the sheer size of YouTube’s operation underscores the importance of what this algorithm does. Every minute, another 400 hours of content are uploaded; it would take a 24/7 staff of 24,000 to watch and monitor every new addition, a job I would wish upon no one. With <a href="https://blog.google/topics/ads/expanded-safeguards-for-advertisers/">“thousands of sites”</a> signing on as advertisers each day and 1.7 billion so-called <a href="https://blog.google/topics/ads/how-we-fought-bad-ads-sites-and-scammers-2016/">“bad ads” </a>removed in 2016 alone, the lines of code that govern ad placement on YouTube are responsible for an almost unthinkable number of decisions that, combined, curate the content that eventually reaches viewers.</p>
<p class="p3">Last month, YouTube, which is owned by Google, changed this algorithm, pulling ad dollars from all “potentially objectionable content,” resulting in a wide range of YouTube stars, from a progressive radio host to a firearm review channel, who watched their funding disappear overnight. The New York Times described the move as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/arts/youtube-broadcasters-algorithm-ads.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">“abrupt” and “vague”</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— while Google billed it as “expanded safeguards for advertisers.” To be sure, advertisers deserve the absolute right to choose what type of content they attach to their brand and reputation, as seen with the mass exodus of advertisers from <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/02/21/advertising-boycott-breitbart/">sites like Breitbart</a>. The rationale behind that boycott, and many others, is a guiding principle of web economics: For website owners, advertisers and sponsored content are power. Without advertiser money, it is hard for anyone online to gain traction as a writer, musician, comedian or artist, which is why the flow of YouTube’s advertising dollars is so integral to its function.</p>
<p class="p3">In late March, the Wall Street Journal reported that major brands like Pepsi, Walmart, Starbucks, General Motors and FX Networks were suspending advertising from YouTube or from the entire Google universe in response to their ads <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-youtube-has-continued-showing-brands-ads-with-racist-and-other-objectionable-videos-1490380551">appearing on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>controversial videos</a>. A company with a conservative CEO might well have valid objections to its advertisements appearing on a left-wing political talk show, and a company whose leadership believes in gun control might feel the same way about the firearm channel. Similarly, it is good to see companies like Google taking some measure of responsibility for the extremism that can flourish on their platforms. But these are personal, human decisions, not ones to leave up to an algorithm. Whatever your feelings about gun control, the testing and reviewing of weapons for informational purposes is not hate speech, and no reasonable human judge could mistake it for hate speech. Misclassification on that scale can only be the fault of erroneous computer programs which, despite increased sophistication, can never take offense at any kind of speech, and so must rely on overly broad and occasionally bizarre metrics to weed out hate. Once code is made political, the ramifications are enormous, both in terms of attracting an increasingly partisan and divided user base and in terms of redefining the boundary between fact and opinion.</p>
<p class="p3">This reliance is dangerous and dystopian, portending an increasingly plausible future in which an algorithm can decide what is good or bad for us to view through basic capitalism. As the disturbing saga of the so-called<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cleveland-police-hunt-suspect-after-facebook-live-killing/"> Facebook Live murder</a> that played out this week demonstrated, we are in completely uncharted territory when it comes to the ethics of online shareable content. But handing control of our standards of decency over to artificial intelligence will only plunge us further into the dark.</p>

		<title>Oke ’20: Why isn’t Providence learning from its troubled history with lead?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hard to imagine that just two miles away from the lavish neighborhoods of College Hill, the threat of lead exposure is about to skyrocket in some of Providence’s poorest areas. Following the Flint, Michigan water scandal, the presence of lead in Rhode Island’s pre-1978 homes and vacant buildings has raised some questions around the state’s recent push to increase local property values by revitalizing older buildings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As recently as 2014, Brady Sullivan Properties — a New England-based real-estate developer — acquired $4 million in tax credits for the renovation of several former mills located <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160909/providences-us-rubber-complex-bouncing-back-as-lofts?start=2">across</a> Rhode Island. The U.S. Rubber Lofts project in the Valley and Olneyville neighborhoods — which have some of the lowest median family <a href="http://www.point2homes.com/US/Neighborhood/RI/Providence/Olneyville-Demographics.html">incomes</a> in the city — seeks to convert the old factory complexes in the area into 302 “loft-style apartments,” with one, two, three and four-bedroom <a href="http://bradysullivan.com/downloads/brochure_usrubberlofts.pdf">units</a> available for residents to lease.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite how appealing the project sounds, it’s important to note the overwhelming effect of gentrification ventures like this have on the existing residents of Providence. The city has a lengthy history of renovation efforts that have <a href="https://oralhistoryacrossthetracks.wordpress.com/2016/03/22/integrated-or-segregated/">disproportionately</a> harmed its <a href="https://blogs.brown.edu/ethn-0790d-s01/2014/11/12/forgotten-fox-point-an-examination-of-the-expansion-of-brown-university-and-the-development-of-the-cape-verdean-fox-point-community/">minority</a> and low-income populations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These ideas have returned to the state agenda in recent years. Since his campaign in 2014, Mayor Jorge Elorza has promised to “revitalize (Providence’s) neighborhoods,” and began the process with his EveryHome program in October 2015. Last year, there were almost 800 properties registered as abandoned in Providence, and the six-year plan was intended to either rehabilitate or demolish up to 600 homes in the <a href="http://www.rhodeislandhousing.org/filelibrary/Mayor%20Elorza%20unveils%20his%20plan%20to%20address%20more%20than%20500%20vacant%20properties%20in%20the%20city,%20WPRI,%2010-13-2015.pdf)">city</a>. It aims to replace them with new, affordable houses for people previously displaced by foreclosures, housing projects and other local changes. Yet these plans, much like the Brady Sullivan project, have not always lived up to their promises.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brady Sullivan has a rather concerning history of exercising dangerous and irresponsible practices on multiple occasions: In August 2016, the company was fined $139,171 by the Environmental Protection Agency for not following federal lead paint removal regulations during a restoration project in Manchester, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160909/providences-us-rubber-complex-bouncing-back-as-lofts?start=2">New Hampshire</a>. In May 2015, a subcontractor hired by Brady Sullivan to do a demolition job was found to have left an inhabited building contaminated with arsenic, cadmium and lead. After discovering that the contractors failed to adequately notify the tenants placed at risk by this oversight, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration then imposed a $19,600 <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/state-feds-discuss-criminal-investigations-linked-asbestos-brady-sullivan-site#stream/0">fine</a> on the company.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Lead exposure in the low-income communities of Rhode Island is nothing new. Before the use of lead paint was banned nationally in 1978, most New England homes contained significant amounts of lead that continue to show up today. This explains why most cases of childhood lead poisoning in Rhode Island are a result of exposure to the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/568bdd5ddf40f37b33197bdd/t/58bd9bc2d2b8577d9d986f6f/1488821188445/RIAHH+Lead+Brief_FINAL.pdf">dust</a> from lead paint.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, the ubiquity of old homes in Rhode Island is most certainly not the sole cause of this state’s alarmingly high rate of lead poisoning in young children. Since 2010, the drinking water in Providence, Cranston and North Providence has exceeded the federal lead standard six times. Almost 13,800 homes in the state receive water through lead-infested pipes that are too expensive for the average low-income resident to replace on their <a href="http://wpri.com/2016/04/11/providences-other-lead-problem-its-tap-water/">own</a>. A study conducted by the University from 1993 to 2005 showed that 48.6 percent of children from Providence, Pawtucket, Central Falls, Woonsocket and Newport had been poisoned by lead. In these neighborhoods, children are four times more likely than the national <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2010/11/lead">average</a> to be diagnosed with lead poisoning. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These facts should not just concern local parents or tenants — they should enrage us all. How can we sit idly and watch Rhode Island’s government “struggle” to find funding for clean water pipes, yet simultaneously award an out-of-state contracting company millions of dollars in tax credits? What good will these fancy new apartments do for those living in poverty, or in single-parent homes, or in houses that have been deemed unfit by federal standards for habitation?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Not only should we members of the Brown community hold elected officials accountable for this disdainful attack on underprivileged neighborhoods, we must also stand in solidarity with the residents of Providence in their fight for a healthy living environment. In no way am I calling upon every Brown student to disproportionately take up public spaces, or even to get involved in every single local campaign. But paying attention to local news, raising awareness of current events that affect the rest of the Providence community or simply acknowledging the University’s role in the displacement of minorities in the area are small acts that can have a big impact. When the state government’s lack of concern for the well-being of its constituents is so blatant, what choice do we have but to open our eyes and take action?</span></p>

		<title>Colby &#039;20: Internship inequities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">The conclusion of spring semester is, for many, a joyous moment. For others it signals an impending deadline to find a summer internship. Even with this deadline mere weeks away, for many Brown students, summer internship prospects remain uncertain. The emphasis that recruiters place upon experience gained through internships means that the hunt for such opportunities begins as early as freshman year. After all, students who begin looking for jobs as seniors will have a tougher time than students who have significant experience under their belts by the time they graduate. But, as it turns out, there are substantial inequities at all stages of the internship placement process, which have long-term consequences for students’ future employment and educational prospects.</p>
<p class="p3">The benefits of internships are clear; they provide needed experience and connections and help a student’s career trajectory. Sadly, many of the most worthwhile internship opportunities are also the most prestigious and competitive, and only seek experienced applicants, such as rising juniors and seniors. The experience these internships demand can often only be acquired through earlier internships and as a result, many underclassmen face a high-stakes internship search. Even with the increased importance of such internships, college career services admit that placement of these underclassmen is comparatively difficult. Diana Seder, Associate Dean and Director of Career Services at Claremont McKenna College admits, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2013/09/26/land-an-internship-after-freshman-year-of-college">“(Freshman) are the young ones, the low men on the totem pole.”</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As such, internship placement for younger students is exceedingly difficult. This reality means that nepotism plays a worryingly large role in initial<span class="s1"> internship prospects.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though Brown assists students in their search for a summer internship through CareerLAB, for many freshmen, this is not enough. CareerLAB’s continued emphasis on “networking” often feels more like an emphasis on nepotism. While networking through telephone interviews and cold emailing through BrownConnect can help students hear about opportunities, they don’t meaningfully increase the chances of finding an internship. Underclassmen around the country are still stuck, unable to acquire internships because they lack experience and cannot get it. As such, networking often means turning to family to obtain initial job experience. This broader trend has been confirmed in the Guardian’s reporting of a study by the Debrett’s Foundation that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2015/sep/17/keeping-it-in-the-family-is-nepotism-a-barrier-to-graduate-jobs">“found seven in every 10 young people aged 16-25 use family connections to get their first job.” </a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But because of the internship system, those who lack familial connections to an industry are stuck without opportunity. As Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, eloquently says, “America’s current internship system, in which contacts and money matter more than talent, contributes to an economy in which access and opportunity go to the people who already have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/opinion/breaking-a-cycle-that-allows-privilege-to-go-to-privileged.html">the most of both.”</a> Presumably, internships exist for the purpose of developing a highly trained workforce. But if internships only go to a privileged few, then their benefits to the economy and to society are dramatically reduced.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Even if inequities in internship placement were diminished, the pervasiveness of unpaid internships also decreases the economic mobility of less privileged students. The shortage of paid internships means that students who come from different socioeconomic backgrounds must either resort to unpaid work — all at the large cost of a summer’s wages — or find paid work in fields totally unrelated to their concentration. Brown offers <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/index.php?q=link">Summer Earnings Waivers</a> for students on financial aid and grants to help cover the costs of unpaid internships, but these opportunities are limited and cannot be used for more than one summer. Frankly, universities have a limited ability to help students trying to find paid internships — there’s only so much funding to go around. Therefore the responsibility lies with companies to offer more paid opportunities — or at least provide stipends — for students to learn and gain work experience. The government should take regulatory steps to make sure the benefits of internships are equitably shared. But, if left unchecked, our flawed internship system will continue to reward the wealthy at the expense of the less privileged. As the Guardian noted on a study by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty commission found,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2015/sep/17/keeping-it-in-the-family-is-nepotism-a-barrier-to-graduate-jobs"> “less able, richer children were 35 percent more likely to become high earners than their brighter, poorer peers.”</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There are companies that commendably attempt to include underprivileged underclassmen in their internship programs. However, these programs can only patch a broken system, not fix it. For example, Morgan Stanley hosts networking events and internship programs specifically for historically underprivileged groups. Their “diversity internship” only admits students from underrepresented communities that are hurt by existing internship inequities. Still, these programs don’t do enough to repair what is a deeply flawed internship industry that perpetuates economic inequality. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As it exists today, the summer internship system symbolically represents the inequality of opportunity that prevails throughout the United States. Unfortunately, the internship placement system is just one component of the American economy that reinforces and broadens inequality. But it isn’t something we should put up with. As we get older, join the workforce and enter positions of influence, we should remain cognizant of the internship system and all the harm that it does — and make an effort to reform it.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">Almost all young people, especially college students, have a form of technology on their person at all times. Whether that be a cellphone, laptop or tablet, all are used to sending messages, calling friends and possibly having a video conversation. All of these usages are perfect for communicating quickly, but I worry this ubiquitous aspect of technology is destroying personal interactions.</p>
<p class="p2">I don’t like the idea of neglecting face-to-face interactions just because technology allows us to. Every day, I see personal interactions that have been changed because of technology. For example, I walked into a cafe yesterday and observed the majority of occupants scrolling through their social media accounts, Skyping a friend or aimlessly searching Google instead of talking to the person sitting right in front of them. It’s estimated that nearly 10,000 interactions within Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr happen per second, while 2,600 Skype calls are placed and around 44,000 gigabytes of internet traffic are used every second. Without a doubt, technology, especially its mobile-friendly forms, has an increasingly pertinent space in the lives of many people.</p>
<p class="p2">It’s true that new technologies offer more convenience and speed than their predecessors. Attending class while sick in bed has become quite simple if the lecture has been recorded. We can order what are now viewed as necessities — Lyfts, videogames, food or clothing — and expect a delivery within minutes or a few days at the longest. As much as I support these very practical uses of technology, I am against the culture of erasing personal interactions and the growth of impatience that I believe it produces.</p>
<p class="p2">There’s an added layer of intimacy during in-person experiences. Being able to clearly see a loved one’s laugh lines, or hug them or “accidentally” bump into them when they say something off-color is priceless and simply not available while communicating through modern-day technology.</p>
<p class="p2">These technologies have gained popularity as they allow conversations to occur almost instantly. In a time-sensitive situation, a quick phone call or email can change the entire outcome. Because of this, there is both a pressure and a need to communicate as quickly as possible, thus fostering a culture of impatience that I don’t think would exist if technology wasn’t such a powerful force in daily life. As technology makes communication increasingly efficient, responses to emails, texts and missed calls are somehow required within a minute’s notice, even on “off-days” that were previously agreed <span class="s1">upon. In light of this, some students refuse to check or respond to emails from their Brown account over the weekend, while others view this as unmannerly and unprofessional behavior. This difference of opinion can be attributed to the fact that boundaries between business and personal are consistently blurred, all in the name of being flexible and possessing a willingness to go above and beyond. These qualities are important, but they are next of kin to impatience. Consistently demanding and expecting immediate responses crosses into dangerous territory if and when it interferes with life, thus normalizing impatience in every situation we encounter.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Technology has broadened our ability to communicate. Often times, technology is the only way to globally communicate with individuals who may not be reachable otherwise. I am by no means discrediting or diminishing these resolute predicaments. But technological capabilities seem to be overstepping their bounds. I find technology most helpful when it enhances personal interactions instead of erasing them. Yet this is not what’s happening. The more technology advances, the further we stray from face-to-face contact — Facetiming replaces phone calls, which replaced in-person interactions. More technology means less physical presence and more voids that need to be filled. Then, the cycle continues: We ignore our immediate surroundings, as I observed in the cafe, in order to absorb technology-ridden business, and then we rush through the absorption of that business while staying connected and neglecting the connections right in front of us. Striking a balance between an online and offline presence has proven to be difficult, but it can lead to a more fulfilling life, one that does not end in becoming a robot waiting for the next email that needs a response.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">When I was younger, I was an idealist; I assumed voters, when given the chance, would only select the best and the brightest to lead them. I looked up to authority figures, especially ones as powerful as presidents, because I assumed they must have done something right for millions to elect them into positions of power. Doesn’t it seem logical — and profoundly comforting — that people would elect someone who is eminently qualified to lead them?</p>
<p class="p3">Unfortunately, the current political climates in many countries would suggest otherwise. Recently, we have seen voters support politicians who are charismatic, but lack expertise or experience and are not well-versed in the subjects they talk about. This pattern bodes poorly for the future of democracies around the world. Former President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/barack-obama/president-obama-attacks-trump-s-wall-anti-intellectualism-rutgers-commencement-n574361">called</a> this phenomenon the “strand of anti-intellectualism” in his address to Rutgers University students. He, like myself, was baffled by the common practice of electing candidates who can be less knowledgable and experienced than citizens themselves. After all, as Obama put it, “It’s not cool to not know what you’re talking about.” With this sentiment, we should take steps to improve our education systems to ensure that the scourge of anti-intellectualism — the rejection of expertise, experience and evidence — doesn’t permanently harm our democracy.</p>
<p class="p3">We must remain aware that anti-intellectualism in our politics manifests itself in a variety of ways. Even in our highly intellectual societies — dependent on constant innovation, scientific advancement and unthinkable technological sophistication — we elect individuals that are often unqualified and unprepared to lead. In other words, we elect anti-intellectuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At some point, we stopped valuing intellectualism, and worse yet, we began to demonize intellectualism and glorify ignorance by electing politicians who deceitfully associate themselves with everyday people. Don’t get me wrong; there’s genuine value in electing someone that’s actually in touch with the daily realities of voters. But politicians who feign humility may be elitist leaders who cater to the problems of their elitist friends, and that doesn’t make for a good leader either.</p>
<p class="p3">Second, political commentators inadvertently facilitate anti-intellectualism by making light of unqualified leaders without making it clear that being unqualified isn’t just a laughing matter — it’s a threat to the democratic system. A recent segment on “Last Week Tonight” with John Oliver mocked the presidential candidates in the upcoming French presidential election. Though I spent the majority of the segment chuckling to myself, when the comedy routine stopped, I couldn’t help but realize I was no longer laughing. It’s good that outlandish claims by politicians provide a lot of easy fodder for late-night television. But when citizens fail to hold their elected officials responsible for the positions they espouse and the things they say, and instead make a joke out of such positions, they end up normalizing the ridiculousness.</p>
<p class="p3">Third, once elected, anti-intellectual rhetoric can turn into damaging policies. Throughout U.S. presidential election cycles, we have witnessed candidates reject the existence of climate change, despite the fact that the scientific consensus points firmly in the direction of global warming. Here’s the problem: Hearing high-ranking politicians denying climate change will lead to at least a portion of the average voter population denying it too.</p>
<p class="p3">So how do we get people to value intellectualism in their lives and value experience over being an outsider? After all, more often than not, outsiders are just that: outside of the system, unaware of what makes the system work and what it takes to change it. I understand that, often, receiving a good education requires a degree of privilege that many are not afforded. Thus, to combat anti-intellectualism in our politics, we need to prioritize teaching<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>voters and future politicians how to separate fact from simple narratives and deceitful campaign promises and instead value learnedness and lived experiences. A good place to start is to change school curriculums so that children from a young age understand that knowledge is a virtue not only in theory but also in practice. Further, we have to dial back our emphasis on wild aspirations and teach kids that dreams require knowledge and skill they have to work for. This culture of impulsive dreaming has serious implications for the quality of our leaders and candidates. Instead of seeking positions of power on a whim, people must be motivated to learn about policy, law and current events themselves before becoming leaders. As a society, we must understand governance isn’t a game, and aspirations of higher office come with enormous responsibilities.</p>

		<title>Steinman ’19: What sustainable investing can do</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/21/steinman-19-sustainable-investing-can/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">It’s been three and a half years since the Corporation voted “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/10/10/divest-coal-expands-goals-new-name-2/?">no</a>” on a divestment proposal submitted by the group then known as Brown Divest Coal in October 2013. When the class of 2017 leaves Brown in a few weeks, they will take with them the last institutional memory of the original manifestation of Brown’s divestment movement, a movement to rid the University’s endowment of all investments linked to coal. Brown Divest Coal restructured itself as Fossil Free Brown a year after the Oct. 2013 vote and extended their proposed negative screen to include oil and natural gas. It continues to exist nominally under the emPOWER umbrella, yet the energy behind the divestment movement is all but gone.</p>
<p class="p3">Despite this stagnation, divestment remains the focus of the conversation around the link between the Investment Office and environmental sustainability, particularly in the environmental activist community. Symbolically, divestment is a powerful move: It sends an institutional message that profiting off the continued use of fossil fuels is egregious and unethical. The further rationale behind divestment is that if it spreads widely enough, it can send shock waves through the fossil fuel economy, making hard-to-reach reserves — which tend to be the dirtiest to burn — suddenly unprofitable. Though I support divestment for its symbolism as a rallying point for environmentalists, there is more that can be done to demonstrate a positive commitment to a carbon-free future. In fact, some of these alternatives are arguably more powerful than divestment, whose effectiveness has been hotly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/01/27/is-divestment-an-effective-means-of-protest">debated</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">This is where sustainable investing comes in. Generally defined as investing that takes into account both fiscal performance and environmental considerations — though the balance between the two can vary widely — sustainable investing is a way to make strides in the direction of a fossil-free future. It provides a positive incentive for businesses to prioritize the environment in their practices. From the investor standpoint, it is a way to profit from sustainability and potentially engage in shareholder advocacy, the practice of using one’s status as a shareholder to lobby for a corporation to become more sustainable.</p>
<p class="p3">Though the Investment Office is deservedly focused on the size of the endowment, there is no need for an absolute trade-off to exist between financial success and environmentalism; a belief in this trade-off ultimately harms both sides. There is a strong case to be made that corporations now aligning themselves with the goals of the environmental movement — efficiency, resource conservation, clean technology and avoidance of fossil fuels — are best positioned to outperform down the line, as resources become depleted and the shift toward renewable energy (whether driven by the market, activism or policy) gains traction.</p>
<p class="p3">In December, the Advisory Committee on Corporate Responsibility in Investment Policies, which makes recommendations to the University on “ethical and moral responsibility in investment policies,” released a proposal to President Christina Paxson P’19 suggesting two things: the establishment of a Climate Investment Task Force and the further promotion of the Brown University Sustainable Investment Fund. BUSIF in particular strikes me as an exceedingly underutilized resource; with no minimum giving requirement, a donation to BUSIF is invested in the Parnassus Endeavor Fund, a portfolio whose companies must “offer outstanding workplaces and must not be engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing or refining of fossil fuels” — in other words, they are divested from fossil fuels, according to Parnassus’ <a href="https://www.parnassus.com/parnassus-mutual-funds/endeavor/investor-shares/">website</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">I know of recent alums who have decided not to donate money to the endowment until the University divests from fossil fuels, and I respect that commitment. But it’s a missed opportunity for both the sustainability-minded alums and for Brown. Making a donation to BUSIF sends a stronger message than withholding a donation to the endowment, and it actively increases the share of the endowment that has essentially been divested. While a primary reason given for the rejection of divestment in 2013 was the fact that Brown owns very few stocks directly and has most of its holdings in funds, we can be more selective about the funds we choose. And for what it’s worth, Parnassus Endeavor performed within the top percentile of funds in the large growth category over the past one, three, five and 10 years, according to <a href="http://beta.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/parwx/quote.html">Morningstar</a>, Inc. BUSIF is not just a fund for idealists, it is a remarkably strong investment.</p>
<p class="p3">I’m not calling for environmentalists, whom I count myself among, to give up their work. But when domestic climate policy is at a standstill (if not in full-fledged retreat), innovative ways to drive change are more needed than ever. We need to look for ways to drive the private sector toward sustainability, especially when the public sector is actively ignoring it. Rather than viewing divestment as the only solution, we can broaden our understanding of the different ways to invest in environmental sustainability and bring closer the dream of a carbon-neutral economy.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, Ivanka Trump came under fire from an unlikely source: Librarians <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ivanka-trump-librarians-national-library-week_us_58f4c2b4e4b0b9e9848d001f">across</a> the country took to Twitter to criticize her for a tweet commemorating National Library Week. The first daughter wrote that, “This #NationalLibraryWeek, we honor our libraries and librarians for opening our eyes to the world of knowledge, learning and reading!” It seemed like a harmless enough post — until people realized that it came on the heels of President Trump’s proposal to dramatically slash funding to public libraries.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are so many concerning elements in Trump’s proposed budget — notably the terrifying funding cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and a simultaneous increase in defense spending — that many other reductions have flown under the radar. But as observers are increasingly pointing <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-trump-arts-endowment-ent-0317-20170316-column.html">out</a>, the Trump administration isn’t just going after oversight agencies like the EPA; it is also brazenly targeting agencies that focus on culture. In fact, Trump’s budget proposes to completely <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/with-elimination-of-nea-and-neh-trumps-budget-is-worst-case-scenario-for-arts-groups/2017/03/15/5291645a-09bb-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?ut">eliminate</a> funding for four independent cultural agencies: the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The IMLS is a 20-year old agency that <a href="https://www.imls.gov/imlsat20">provides</a> support to 35,000 museums and 123,000 libraries across the country. Of its $230 million budget, $214 million is generally <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/economy-budget/328084-trump-budget-devalues-libraries">funneled</a> directly to state and local libraries. Because the IMLS provides them with so much technical and financial support, thousands of libraries and their members will be harmed if the agency’s funding is dissolved.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now, it should come as no surprise that Trump wants to decrease funding for libraries. In stark contrast to former President Barack Obama — who was often referred to as the “reader-in-chief” and regularly published reading lists to inspire admirers like me<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— Trump has so far given no indication that he has ever picked up a book for leisure. The one book Trump recently <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-trump-book-joke-20170417-story.html">claimed</a> to have read and liked? “Reasons to Vote for Democrats” by Michael J. Knowles, a 256-page satirical book mostly filled with blank pages.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Regardless of Trump’s personal reading habits, the debate over federal funding to libraries is a perennial one. Many Republican lawmakers have previously tried to roll back funding to agencies like the IMLS, including U.S. Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, R-WI, in 2015. But the scale of Trump’s proposal is unprecedented: No previous president has tried to get rid of funding for the agency altogether.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, given the Trump administration’s myriad troubling policy proposals, the funding cuts to libraries are understandably low on many Americans’ list of priorities. Yet this move raises concerns regarding how the Trump administration views the importance of community spaces, arts and education.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a world where American children spend more time sitting in front of a screen than with books, libraries are <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/04/07/library-users-and-learning/">receiving</a> fewer visitors by the year. But they still serve an important purpose in communities across the country. They play a critical role in the education system, allowing students of all ages and backgrounds to gain access to a range of resources — not just books, but also computers, tablets and information tools like research databases. Crucially, they address the needs of low-income families, providing a more level playing field for those who would not otherwise have access to many books and educational materials. They can also instill a lifelong love of books in young children — a trait that is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/07/22/does-reading-fiction-make-you-a-better-person/?utm_term=.0114cfee015f">associated</a> with higher levels of empathy and lower levels of stress, among other indicators.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And the benefits of libraries extend beyond access to books and resources. They are also community-building hubs, offering a central public space for citizens to congregate, discuss and engage with each other. Libraries have even been <a href="http://connect.ala.org/files/2139/LBTA%20Libraries%20%26%20Civic%20Engagement.pdf">known</a> to build civic engagement by providing visitors with the tools to make more informed voting decisions and learn more about policies that affect them. For all of these reasons and more, public libraries still merit at least some federal funding.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Trump’s budget cuts will stack the odds against public libraries, many of which are already struggling and rely on federal assistance. The Providence Public Library is no exception: It has <a href="http://www.provlib.org/news/providence-public-library-receives-530000-imls-grant-create-high-impact-workforce-development">received</a> numerous grants from the IMLS — most recently a $530,000 grant last year — to implement community programs for teen workforce development and digital literacy. While the Providence Public Library does have other sources of funding, it will still have to make up for the imminent drop in federal grants. I only hope it can <a href="http://www.provlib.org/news/providence-public-library-planning-transforming-renovation-its-downtown-building">move</a> forward with its programs and expansion plans despite the setback.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I realize that, with all of Trump’s reckless policy decisions in recent months, the rollback of federal assistance to public libraries isn’t the most pressing or alarming of issues. But as someone who grew up relying on public libraries for my daily intake of books, I am genuinely horrified at the prospect of a world where another child might not have the same opportunity.</span></p>

		<title>Liang ’19: Cheating and U.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This spring <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/education/students-accused-of-cheating-return-awkwardly-to-a-changed-harvard.html">marks</a> the fifth anniversary of one of the largest cheating scandals in recent Ivy history: the Harvard Government 1310 case, where nearly two percent of the entire undergraduate student body had individual cases brought against them for plagiarism on the take-home final. I wish I could say Brown is better, but recent events only seem to confirm that academic dishonesty remains a major issue on campus. In fact, a Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/11/14/poll-majority-of-students-do-not-cheat/">poll</a> from the same year as Harvard’s cheating scandal found that as many as one-fifth of students admitted to cheating as described by our current academic code.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the Herald also reports, 49 students were <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/17/u-addresses-academic-code-violations/">charged</a> with academic code violations in the past academic year; more than half of those violations occurred in the computer science department, which uses software to track plagiarized code. As a result, the standing committee on the Academic Code is planning to almost double its members. I personally witnessed the fallout of a cheating scandal this semester during an Introductory Biochemistry midterm. Stories abound about cheating incidents in the economics and physics departments, especially in larger introductory classes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Academic cheating, as defined by the University, has and will always happen in college, and I doubt it will ever go away. In fact, with the onset of new technologies like Turnitin.com built into Canvas, more and more cases will arise as other departments gain access to rigorous tools comparable to the computer science department’s current coding trackers. This isn’t to say that more people will cheat … just that more will be caught. But this technology, while useful from the perspective of professors, fails to address the institutionalized issues that lead to these incidents in the first place. We have to evaluate these problems from the perspectives of both students and administration if we are going to change anything.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For students, it can be difficult to find out precisely what cheating is. The Academic Code <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/sites/brown.edu.academics.college.degree/files/uploads/Academic-Code.pdf">states</a> that cheating can, among other concepts, involve, “engaging in collaboration or unauthorized assistance on assignments.” There is so much nuance in how this statement can be interpreted: For example, is someone cheating if they bounce off ideas for a proof with a teaching assistant? A group tutor? A friend? Is all homework supposed to occur in an isolated bubble, without so much as breathing in the direction of another student? What about open-book, “collaborative” exams like the ones in ENGN 0090: “Management of Industrial and Nonprofit Organizations”? Anyone walking in the Ratty can overhear conversations of “can you help me with this problem …” or “what do you think about …” — which I think is indicative of Brown’s especially collaborative learning environment. The issue is figuring out where to draw the line.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Professors need to do better in helping us figure out that line. Faculty are encouraged to elaborate on their personal standards for academic integrity, but I’ve seen many a syllabus that simply says, “refer to Brown’s Academic Code,” which in itself is confusing enough. Because this student community views collaboration as implicit, each professor needs to spell out in writing or in class what constitutes acceptable behavior, especially with regard to assignments that routinely involve collaboration (like homework or short responses). The computer science department already does a great job of clarifying its policies, constantly reminding students of the Academic Code and CS’s interpretation of it —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it’s time other departments step up as well.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, academic integrity is fundamentally a group responsibility. Students should have as much input as professors, if not more, in defining what that means. I am firmly in support of developing an interactive honor code that permeates campus conversation, rather than an online summer tutorial or a week dedicated to emphasizing academic integrity, two suggestions that were raised in the recent Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/17/u-addresses-academic-code-violations/">article</a>. Studies show that students behave better when engaging in a system of moral reciprocity, rather than a system where they just get lectured. As the standing committee prepares to double its numbers, why not accept students among those new members? I imagine a student committee on academic integrity or even a judicial board that makes decisions on punishments, similar to groups described in a recent Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/04/how-to-stop-cheating-in-college/479037">article</a>. Who better to teach would-be transgressors about the line between acceptable and unacceptable collaboration that those who have lived it? If students themselves are engaged in the system of academic investigations, they will start a trickle-down effect where the entire student body becomes aware of their responsibilities as members of this community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown, for all its stereotyping as a happy-go-lucky school, is not immune from the pressures of academic perfection and the burdens that fuel desperate cheating. In fact, our laissez-faire approach, both in the open curriculum and written discussions of the Academic Code, is perhaps the largest disconnect between administrators and the student body in expectation and follow-through of learning objectives. I have no doubt that given the opportunity, the student body will come together and develop a more rigorous (and clearer) set of language to discuss the nature of plagiarism, illegal collaboration and academic policy. The only question is when.</span></p>

		<title>Johnson &#039;19: The misogyny factor</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/24/johnson-19-misogyny-factor/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Wednesday, Fox News finally dismissed the host of “The O’Reilly Factor” after years of silencing sexual assault allegations with settlements. Bill O’Reilly earned Fox News $446 million in advertising revenue over a span of two years, a figure that dwarfs the $13 million the company paid to address women’s complaints about the host<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html?_r=0"> for more than a decade</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is therefore unsurprising that the reason Fox News dismissed O’Reilly 13 years after the first public allegation against him is precisely because of money. After a New York Times expose and demonstrations by the women’s rights <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/bill-oreilly-protest-fox-news-sexual-assault-lawsuits-protest-demonstration-585289">group Ultraviolet</a>, over 50 companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/opinion/bill-oreilly-and-the-upside-of-corporate-cowardice.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">pulled their ads </a>from O’Reilly’s segment. Forcing O’Reilly out of the network had nothing to do with respect for women’s rights in the workplace; it was an economic calculation and a business deal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is the second time this year that a highly visible figure at Fox News has left amidst claims of sexual assault. Robert Ailes, former chief executive officer and chairman of Fox News, left the company last summer with a $40 million exit package after being accused six times. After his departure, a former network booker revealed that the company was aware for more than two decades that she had been <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/20/media/fox-news-sex-harassment/">harassed by Ailes</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another host filed a lawsuit against Ailes and O’Reilly, and Fox News responded by <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/20/media/fox-news-sex-harassment/">calling her an opportunist, not a victim</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As more victims came forward with allegations after Ailes left the network, Fox’s responses were to deny the charges and to pay whatever was needed to keep the women silent. Though after the Ailes scandal Fox News stated that it will not tolerate behavior that “disrespects women or contributes to an uncomfortable work environment,” their response to O’Reilly’s scandal clearly negates those claims. Every response revolved around money — how much profit the old men made the company, how much money could be spent to settle lawsuits and how much would be lost when companies pulled their advertisements.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And Fox News continues to facilitate sexual harassment. O’Reilly’s successor, Tucker Carlson, believes Democrats <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/9-times-bill-oreillys-replacement-tucker-carlson-showed-off-his-sexist-cred_us_58f7a169e4b0de5bac43429c">made up the term “sexual harassment”</a> and made light of the outrage surrounding President Trump’s boasts of sexual assault. He also called Hillary Clinton “castrating” and this year’s “A Day Without A Woman” protest an “attack on white men.” Hiring another sexist host shows just how little the Fox News image relies on truth or respectability. How is O’Reilly’s absence from Fox News any sign of progress when the network hired a replacement so blatantly misogynistic?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need to keep holding powerful corporations like Fox News accountable, even if their priorities lie nowhere near equal rights in the workplace. It can be easy for the left to label Fox News as an uncredible, right-wing news outlet and never engage with the network. But we need to pay attention to the internal politics within the corporation as well as the politics it spews on television. As a public audience, we cannot let money cover up the network’s glaring systemic sexism. Instead, we can use our consumer power to manipulate network decisions. Though O’Reilly’s departure involved an estimated <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/20/media/bill-oreilly-millions-payout/">$25 million payout</a>, it was spurred by the New York Times investigation and the ensuing protests. However stagnant Fox’s 1950s style sexism stays, we can’t stop protesting. Recent events have proved that this works: In a matter of days, United Continental Holdings lost $225 million in market stock value after mass public outrage over their <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2017/04/11/united-stock-falls/100325694/">violent removal of a passenger</a>. Coalition can cause change, even when profit still defines success from a corporate perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> That definition of success can shroud misogyny and explains in part how we elected Trump, another top-tier executive accused of sexual harassment. Trump’s fake gilded brand name appealed more to many Americans than the superior qualifications of his opponent, a Yale-educated lawyer, senator and secretary of state. The released Access Hollywood tape that captured Trump’s brags of assault did not impact the result of his campaign. Instead, Trump’s wealth and celebrity gave him immunity from the ramifications of his harassment; in his own words, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women">“When you’re a star they let you do it.”</a> The illusion of success allows too many hateful sexual offenders to remain in power, and the trance that a few executive males hold over a large portion of our country is revolting. Money is, depressingly, still power. But as O’Reilly’s departure signifies, our public outrage has power, too.</span></p>

The marijuana-centric celebrations of 4/20 indulgently highlight inequities and entitlement while staging an exclusive takeover of public spaces. I’m reminded of this every year, and 2017 was no different. The last thing I want to do is take a gratuitous hit on a ritual that many seem to enjoy, but the stakes are higher than people seem willing to acknowledge. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">First, consider the (hazy) image that graces the Main Green at twenty minutes past four. Hordes of Ivy League students lazing about basking in possession of an illegal substance, enjoying its effects with carefree and shameless sentiment. Students seem to be more bemused by this image than they are critical of its reflection on passive entitlement. Indeed, I did not have to be anywhere near any type of green (Main or otherwise) to know through Snapchat and other social media how my friends spent their afternoon. The broadcasting of this lawlessness is irksome, as it gloats at the unearned privilege of non-punishment with relative cheer. Such flippant acknowledgment laughs in the face of serious injustice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It isn’t difficult to be persuasive about the inequities highlighted by 4/20. Over the course of the day’s activities, the Providence Police are nowhere in sight. But in Rhode Island, possession of up to one ounce of marijuana is “a civil violation, punishable by a $150 fine, no jail time and no criminal record,” and possession of one ounce to one kilogram is a <a href="http://norml.org/laws/item/rhode-island-penalties-2">misdemeanor</a> “punishable by a maximum of one year imprisonment and a maximum fine of $500.” A 2016 American Civil Liberties Union report showed that though the rate of drug use for black adults and white adults in the United States is similar, “a Black adult is 2.5 times more likely to be arrested for drug possession.” The report <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/every-25-seconds-human-toll-criminalizing-drug-use-united-states">showed</a> that Rhode Island has some of the worst racial disparities for drug-related arrest numbers: “Blacks in Rhode Island were arrested for drug possession at almost three times the rate of whites in 2014.” This <a href="http://www.riaclu.org/news/post/black-rhode-islanders-almost-three-times-more-likely-to-be-arrested-for-dru">disparity</a> illustrates more egregious disproportionality than do arrest rates in Ferguson, Missouri, according to FBI <a href="http://riaclu.org/issues/issue/the-school-to-prison-pipeline-disproportionate-arrest-rates">data</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2">My classmates are very conscious of their privilege, including the systems that enable them to celebrate 4/20 unpunished. I think that’s a good thing. But this criticism generally only goes as far as saying something along the lines of, “Oh yeah, that’s messed up, I think weed should be legal.” It does not dissuade anyone from celebrating the existence of our protected enclave at Brown, which to me illustrates a hard limit to a social critique of such systems. People complain that activism at Brown is more performative than substantive — well, here’s exhibit A. (And, of course, that’s not to mention the questionable ethics of supporting an underground industry that can rely on violence and exploitation of people, as drug trafficking so often does.)</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In addition to projecting entitlement, the celebration of 4/20 undermines the intentional creation of safe and inclusive common spaces at Brown. Some students are made uncomfortable by the idea of sharing the Main Green with illicit drug use. This might be the case for a variety of reasons — physical discomfort based on health or preference or a feeling of social exclusion among those who choose not to partake. Furthermore, some religious traditions (including groups within Islam, Buddhism and Mormonism, among others) prohibit the use of marijuana and other intoxicants. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Again, I understand and sympathize with the counterargument that the day’s ritual is short-lived and easily-avoidable, thereby justifying the enjoyment and sense of community it brings to its participants. My response to that is twofold. First, that community is a continuous commitment built on a sense of mutual respect that this has the clear potential to breach. A one-day blip in inclusivity undermines ongoing community-building efforts. And second, that it isn’t ideal for an event that elicits some of the highest levels of community spirit at Brown to be centered around substance use. Similar <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/04/14/tisch-17-kaufman-17-spring-weekend-not-everyone/">cases</a> have been made in the past regarding the inclusivity of Spring Weekend, drawing upon further reasons why substance use in community settings is exclusionary. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We should respect that our common spaces are meant to be enjoyed by all and understand that they can put a spotlight on ugly manifestations of privilege. Changing this might take a joint effort, but it’s surely the chill thing to do.</span></p>

		<title>Friedman &#039;19: Time to revisit our AP exam policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Congratulations to the 2,722 students — of a record 32,724 applicants — <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/30/u-admits-record-low-8-3-percent-applicants-class-2021/">admitted to Brown for fall 2017.</a> It is no surprise that Brown (which accepted a record-low 8.3 percent of applicants this year) and the other Ivy League universities have become increasingly selective over the past decade, as many Ivies are refusing to increase their class sizes despite rising domestic and foreign demand for an elite undergraduate education. It is also no surprise that Ivy-hopeful high school students continue to engage in a brutal arms race to take the highest possible number of Advanced Placement courses, both to improve their weighted GPAs and to look more appealing to elite universities. The number of high school students participating in the AP program has steadily increased over the last 60 years. Yet, despite its pervasiveness in the admission process, AP classes are increasingly being dismissed by elite universities for course credit.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many universities are now reconsidering their AP credit policies in light of renewed debate over the rigor of the AP program. Hakan Tell, associate professor of classics at Dartmouth, told the New York Times in 2013, “The psychology department got more and more suspicious about how good an indicator a 5 on the AP Psych exam was for academic success.” As a result, Dartmouth began requiring students requesting credit to take a condensed Psych 1 final. The results: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/education/dartmouth-stops-credits-for-excelling-on-ap-test.html">“Of more than 100 students who had scored a 5 on the AP exam, 90 percent failed the Dartmouth test.”</a> According to the Wall Street Journal, the biology and chemistry departments at Penn have expressed similar concerns that “students who used their AP scores to skip introductory courses fared worse in upper-division classes than those who took the full sequence at Penn because they weren’t as well-prepared.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Colleges reacted differently to the findings. In 2014, <a href="https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2013/02/dartmouth-issues-statement-clarifying-advanced-placement-decision">Dartmouth</a> began refusing to count AP credits across the board for graduation. <a href="http://www.admissions.upenn.edu/apply/freshman-admission/externalexamcredit">Penn</a>, on the other hand, still accepts AP credits for class credit if the student earns a 5 on the AP exam. Harvard is still using the “advanced standing” system it established before the recent wave of studies, but public statements by Harvard administrators seem to contradict actual university policies: Although William Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions at Harvard, called AP tests among the <a href="https://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/harvarddean-part2/">“best predictors”</a> of success in 2009, Harvard still refuses to accept any APs unless students have taken a minimum of eight AP classes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Brown was an early proponent of this trend: It is one of the few schools that has traditionally refused to provide class credit for APs outright. According to Brown’s website, “Advanced Placement exam scores are not eligible for course credit.” Though students may <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/policies/advanced-placement">“enroll in higher-level courses … AP credit will not increase your course credit total.”</a> In other words, students have to stay at Brown for the full four-year term, even if they could meet graduation requirements early by utilizing AP credits. The Herald has criticized similar Brown policies that prevent accelerated graduation in the past, thus far to no avail. In preventing students from graduating early despite possessing AP course credits that fulfill graduation requirements, Brown maintains the strictest AP credit policy in the Ivy League. Though Brown is definitely not alone, it seems counterintuitive that the Ivy League’s supposedly most progressive university enforces the Ivy League’s least progressive course credit policy. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is obvious that this policy levies unfair financial burdens on low-income students, as The Herald’s editorial (<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/10/13/editorial-remove-barriers-early-graduation/">“Remove barriers to early graduation,” Oct. 13, 2016</a>) stated last fall: “Taking an extra year to earn a degree of equal merit and hiring appeal is a luxury that some students cannot afford.” We live in an era when college is becoming less and less affordable, and the value of a college education — relative to the debt incurred to acquire it — is being called into question. According to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/09/news/economy/college-not-worth-it-goldman/">CNNMoney</a>, the average student leaves college with $34,000 of debt, which is 70 percent more than it was 10 years ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Coupled with Brown’s policy that prevents accelerated graduation, the University’s current AP policy basically mandates that all students must pay the University $272,424 within four years ($68,106 annually) in order to graduate. This requirement strains the financial aid system and is unfair to low-income students who shouldn’t be forced to take extra classes to satisfy a purely administrative requirement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is also hypocritical for Brown to place such a value on APs in the admission process while simultaneously dismissing them in the academic process. This can create unprecedented amounts of stress for high school students: In New Jersey’s West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District, for example, 68 percent of AP students <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/26/nyregion/reforms-to-ease-students-stress-divide-a-new-jersey-school-district.html">“reported feeling stressed about school ‘always or most of the time.’”</a> Yet, despite the amount of attention the APs receive at the high school level, the curriculum is almost trivialized at the college level. At elite universities, the AP system has become just another proxy for admission, not a legitimate way to earn credit for college classes. Brown, Harvard, Dartmouth, Duke and other universities that maintain similar policies have, in a way, perverted the original intent of the AP curriculum — to give exceptional high school students a chance at more challenging coursework — by acknowledging it exclusively in the admission process.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Brown’s policy also runs against the open curriculum and the idea of a liberal education. Accepting APs would allow for more flexibility in selecting courses, which is one of the main reasons why students choose Brown in the first place. According to Brown’s website, “the open curriculum ensures you great freedom in directing the course of your education.” This seems facetious in light of the underlying fact that the “academic journey” of many Brown students is hampered by its restrictive AP policies.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is clear that the AP system is in need of profound change to better prepare high school students for college-level classes. But since the College Board has been unsuccessful in revising the AP curriculum in the past, universities must adapt to the current reality. Given the many advantages of accepting AP curricula for course credit, Brown should ease its AP course credit policies so that its academic requirements are as liberal as its ethos.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the wake of the 2016 election, numerous articles were written placing at least part of the blame for Hillary Clinton’s defeat on America’s urbanites — simply for living where they do. City-dwellers, the logic went, were essentially self-gerrymandering, diminishing their political impact by living in high-population states like New York or California with fewer Electoral College votes per capita. This evaluation correctly assesses the structure of the Electoral College but fails to adequately consider the impact of cities on our political culture. As many of us graduate and look to move out into the real world, most of us become the exact educated liberals addressed in articles that criticize young, urban Democrats such as “Go Midwest, Young Hipster.” This argument — which urges young liberals who seek to have political impact in elections to move to rural areas that aren’t already blue — should not sway any of us.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The main basis for this position is accurate: High-density areas are represented poorly in an electoral system that starts every state with at least three votes. A New York voter has one-fourth of the electoral power of one living in Wyoming. Yet, the fact that we live within a flawed system is no reason to ignore the myriad benefits that cities bring to society.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Firstly, cities offer many incontrovertible and relatively apolitical benefits to their residents. High density allows for efficient and accessible public transit, which both lowers the environmental impact of those living there and increases access for those who want to forego driving. Apartment buildings are far greener than homes. Cities are job creators, as a single block might hold numerous small businesses. Politics cannot change these realities. Regardless of what this or any other administration does, regardless of even your own politics, the positive impact city-dwellers make to the environment and the economy are inherent simply to living there.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yet more importantly, the argument that liberals should move away from cities to have their votes count ignores the fact that cities are liberalizing forces in American politics. Yes, now it seems as though liberals are flocking to cities to be with like-minded individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But why are cities liberal in the first place? This, too, can be seen as inherent to urban life. Exposure to people who have other viewpoints is one of the single most impactful determinants of a liberal perspective. Cities themselves — by exposing their inhabitants to a greater diversity of people — work to make their inhabitants more understanding and tolerant. The fact that liberal people go to urban areas isn’t the whole picture; living in an urban area can make people more liberal. If we want America to become a place more accepting of different identities, we should be promoting migration to places with high density and diversity, not discouraging it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Finally, when choosing a place to live, the electoral power of a place crosses so few people’s minds that the discussion is more than a moot point. Is the system slanted to give more power to those living in small states? Yes, absolutely. Should we demand that young people hamper their job prospects by moving to a small town where the economy centers around a single industry, rather than trying their luck in New York or Los Angeles? Of course not. Should we blame this problem on liberals looking for a nice place to start their lives? No. If you really need to place blame, New Hampshire — which worked to create a system where small states have considerable power during the drafting of the Constitution — might be a decent place to start (though at this point you’d be better off looking toward the future). </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Young Americans are steadily becoming more urban. Of all the things that could stop this trend, the Electoral College doesn’t have a chance. If you want to move to a rural area after Brown, that’s fantastic: Don’t let me stop you. But rather than repeatedly trying to game the current electoral system by convincing more young progressives to find small towns in Indiana appealing, we should focus our efforts on making the system more representative of a future — and increasingly urban — America. If a system doesn’t work for a nation with cities, it’s better to reform the system than to do away with cities themselves. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With Commencement just 31 days away, many of my fellow seniors find themselves in the throes of a full-blown existential crisis. Last September, I wrote myself <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/09/kumar-17-a-pep-talk-for-senior-year/">“A pep talk for senior year,”</a> in which I found cause for optimism despite “a general sense that the world into which we were born is dissolving and morphing into something new and terrifying.” Nearly eight months later, the global political landscape has changed dramatically, but the tension between hope and despair feels more palpable than ever. How can we react to the challenges assaulting us from every direction without yielding to negativity?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The first possible reaction is fear. Still unsure of my post-graduation plans, it would be dishonest of me not to admit to feeling an occasional twinge of crippling anxiety over my uncertain future. Perhaps I will have to move in with my parents due to a sluggish job market; perhaps my professional career won’t reach the heights of my academic career. This personal fear is magnified by political upheaval around the world. Will North Korea instigate a devastating nuclear war? What does the future of Russo-American relations hold? Will we remain powerless to save innocent civilians in Syria or persecuted gay men in Chechnya? If you only read the news, the world can feel very scary indeed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But there’s no point in succumbing to fear — it’s the least productive of reactions and no fun whatsoever. We’re talking about our lives, after all, and we have to battle to make them as fruitful and secure as possible. The second reaction, then, is anger: indignation at a federal government that threatens to undermine the success of science and medicine, fields that have worked magic for the quality and quantity of life; rage at the terrorism that continues to leave many stricken with fear and the armed conflict that destroys families and societies; disgust with political leaders incapable of putting aside their party loyalties for the greater good.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Anger is useful when it can be channeled to productive ends, as it was during last <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/23/advocates-march-science-rhode-island/">Saturday’s March for Science</a>. But it’s important not to misdirect this anger toward scapegoats like immigrants, people of color and religious minorities. We should throw our righteous indignation at the decision makers, not at marginalized people who bear the brunt of their damaging policies and rhetoric. Nor should we automatically hold those on the opposite side of the political spectrum in contempt. When anger slips to hate of the other, we become uglier as individuals and as a society.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Last week, a French police officer, Xavier Jugelé, was shot dead while on duty on the Champs-Élysées. The Islamic State quickly claimed responsibility for the attack, in which two other police officers were injured. On Tuesday, Jugelé’s partner, Etienne Cardiles, delivered a moving tribute during a ceremony attended by French President François Hollande and presidential candidates Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. Amid personal memories of Jugelé and remarks on the indispensability of police officers to democratic society, Cardiles <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2017/04/25/je-souffre-sans-haine-l-hommage-vibrant-a-xavier-jugele-tue-sur-les-champs-elysees_5117289_1653578.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_campaign=Echobox&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook#link_time=1493131713">spoke unwaveringly</a> (in French) about rejecting hate: “This hate, Xavier, I don’t have it … because the general interest, the service of others and the protection of all were part of your upbringing and your convictions, and because tolerance, dialogue and temperance were your greatest weapons.” In Jugelé’s life — as in Cardiles’, too, despite his grief — there was no room for hate. He was too preoccupied with the hard work of serving others to consider despising them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Indeed, service is a far better reaction to today’s challenges than hate. Whereas the latter can only be destructive, the former is always creative. By identifying what we can do best to help others, we can mend the rifts that divide us and enrich our own lives. At Brown, this spirit of service is everywhere, from the staff members who keep our facilities clean and safe to the faculty members and administrators who have stepped up in recent months to defend the future of higher education. And of course, this spirit is best embodied in the students, be they entrepreneurs or social justice advocates, artists or scientists. The work that the Brown community performs every day in the service of others is the very opposite of the hate that Cardiles so eloquently rejected. It is love in action. With the strength of this love, the only logical reaction can be hope. Stronger than fear or anger, this hope is powerful enough to eclipse hate altogether.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Negativity is such a weighty burden. Fear is crippling. Unchecked anger is blinding. Hate is suffocating. When I pass through the Van Wickle Gates on May 28, I intend to shed that weight — for a lighter, brighter future.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inspired by the mother of the protagonist Sam in “Transformers 2,” my dad proudly paraded through Keeney on orientation day with my baby shoes around his neck (or “baby booties,” as Sam’s mom calls them).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I took my first steps in these tiny red shoes. They flew with me across the Pacific from Toronto to Beijing when I was barely two. Sixteen years later, my dad carefully packed them into his suitcase to Providence. Barely aware of their existence, I sensed that this pair of palm-sized mementos held more sentimental value for my parents than for me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Growing up, I had always relied on my parents for advice. A trivial dilemma: what shoes to wear to prom? Or a major one: which university to attend? Involving my parents in every step was like a game of trust-fall. I openly embraced new risks, but only when assured that a safety net would catch me if I really “fell.” I expected my parents to right my wrongs before I hit the ground. This was the thinking that accompanied me as I first walked through the Van Wickle Gates.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Coming from Beijing, I had never watched a single football game, let alone the Super Bowl, and I initially thought Greek life was a secret society for history majors. Being international on top of being an already lost freshman was not easy. In the first months of college, I constantly dialed those familiar digits for advice like a natural reflex, looking for detailed analyses of the pros and cons of joining a certain student group or for lengthy discussions of the correct course choices to support my career plans.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet it was not long before these “consulting sessions” with my parents became a one-way monologue. I labored to explain how “shopping period” worked, what “S/NC” meant, why the Sci Li was not exactly for sciences and the many other aspects of Brown undergraduate student life that my parents were not involved in. They could not judge a course based on a mere five-word title without having sat through the professor’s passionate (or bone-dry) lecture. They did not feel the exhilarating chills down my spine as clever ideas bounced off one another in my seminar discussion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Having received his MBA from a top Canadian university, my dad was among the first batches of Chinese students to study abroad. But that was still 25 years ago, in a different school and with a considerably less diverse and liberal student body. The picture he painted of his own college life ultimately failed to match mine. I was the one experiencing every angle of Brown firsthand.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Without the safety net of my parents’ guidance, I began treading the waters on my own. Despite my initial reluctance, I realized that if there was one place to start crafting my own path, Brown was that place. I also realized I was not alone in these foreign waters because every one of my fellow classmates was in her own process of self-discovery.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I took eight different classes in eight different departments during my freshman year. I learned the steps of the waltz in Sayles Hall and danced until my toes went numb. I tutored refugee children from Somalia alongside local volunteers. I received my bid from Kappa Delta, a national sorority with 120 years of history.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> And then there were the not-so-easy decisions. After spending numerous nights covered in oil paint and combing through the RISD course catalogue for four semesters, I found I was not that passionate about painting anymore. At some point between reading Balzac and Faulkner, I realized that I enjoyed books for leisure more than for an English degree. I tried out investment banking one summer despite my parents’ initial insistence that I was not fit for the industry. Yet looking back today, weeks from graduation, I could not be happier with my economics and art history concentrations, knowing that I made these decisions based on my own experiences.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During these four years, I have come to terms with the fact that my parents cannot and will not hold my hand every step of the way. College is a time for growth and self-discovery. It is also a painstaking process of letting go, for us students and for our parents. Sometimes we tread slowly and cautiously, and sometimes we stride forward with confidence. While I know that my parents will always support me unconditionally, I am now confident enough to walk out of the Van Wickle Gates in the direction I choose to take.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After all, I have outgrown those “baby booties.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Making your way to the top of College Hill is not always easy. In the fall of 1982, fresh off his flight from Islamabad, Pakistan and totally alone, Syed Ejaz Husain ’86 MD’90 trekked up the uneven cobblestone sidewalk with his suitcase encasing all of his belongings for college. The young international student’s bus driver told him buses didn’t go up the hill and left Syed at the intersection of North Main and Waterman on a hot summer day. When the sweat-drenched, overdressed and mustachioed 19-year-old finally arrived at Faunce House, he asked fellow students for directions before finding his new dormitory, Everett Hall. Once he settled in and oriented himself within the campus, he embarked upon two intertwined journeys. The first: navigating Brown as an international undergraduate student; the second, and perhaps more daunting: living in the United States, which he would soon call his permanent home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Syed’s small world grew magnitudes during his time at Brown, thanks to the welcoming and collaborative atmosphere Brown is still famous for today. That is not to say that Brown was not competitive at the time — in fact, alums often point out that Brown’s admissions were more competitive than Harvard’s, certainly validating a certain t-shirt still sold in the Brown Bookstore today. Brown was the place to be, but it was still quite easy to be out of place at Brown. Though both Brown and the United States have seen immense social, academic and cultural progress over the past decades, many students, international or not, still feel similarly out of place.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perhaps what helped Syed jumpstart his journeys most during his time at Brown was his friendship with his freshman-year roommate, Andy Lazris ’86, a bright young history buff eager to take full advantage of Brown’s open curriculum. The two bonded immediately, though they came from entirely different cultural and social backgrounds — Syed from conservative and nascent Pakistan and Andy from progressive New Jersey.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The two developed a unique relationship that combined traditional friendship and mentorship. Though the two young men shared similar interests — most notably medicine — their levels of preparation for college were vastly different. Primarily educated in Pakistan and England, Syed found that his study methods and unfamiliarity with the liberal arts hindered his ability to explore new subject areas while still successfully completing the rigorous pre-medical curriculum Brown offered. Andy, on the other hand, relished the opportunity to delve into history and challenged himself often by taking upper-level courses as an underclassman. The contrast exemplifies Brown’s commitment to nurturing personal academic interests — students may pursue whatever they wish to study. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Syed concentrated in biology and Andy in history, though both eventually attended medical school in the following years. Though the two continued their strong friendship in the years after college through email and phone calls, the now-practicing physicians reunited in person in the fall of 2013, when it was time to drop off their own children at Brown: myself and David Lazris, both graduating this year in the class of 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One generation later, a new friendship began to develop. But our journeys are very different. Instead of spending days cooped up in the upper levels of the Sci Li (we now only spend hours there) or spending most of our evenings at the East Campus Dining Center, David and I have been able to branch out. David is on the crew team and performs medical research during his summers, while I have served as the science editor for The College Hill Independent and work in an organic geochemistry lab. David concentrated in history while I chose to concentrate in geochemistry. David and I both pursued the pre-medical curriculum, and we took many classes together as our fathers did. Like our fathers before us, we have been able to bond over the difficulty of classes and our satisfaction with being able to pursue the subject areas toward which we are most drawn. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When David and I meet up, we often find artifacts from our fathers’ friendships in our own. We relay our respective fathers’ stories to one another and find much-needed humor in the nostalgia that we ourselves will hopefully feel one day. We also find comfort in knowing that we share experiences relatable to those of our fathers — stressful exam periods, excitement for Spring Weekend and awe for Professor Ken Miller ’70 P’02, who taught his famous biology course even then.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So much has changed since then. Brown <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and America are different. Yet, like always, Brown students are ready to engage in debate and discussion, all while focusing heavily on furthering their own liberal educations. From one generation to another, Brown continues to foster critical conversations and challenge us to embark on our own journeys with confidence and knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And when we depart from thy friendly protection,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And boldly launch out upon life’s stormy main,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We’ll oft look behind us with grateful affection,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And live our bright college days over again.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In high school, I started a Tumblr account with the username, “peoplecartographer.” I titled the blog “Atlas” and wrote a short description: “A collection of maps. An exploration of the world.” My posts featured maps I found online — including a map of terms used in the United States to refer to water fountains highlighting Rhode Island’s peculiar preference for “bubblers” — accompanied by a paragraph of my analysis. Though I concluded this “Atlas” during the summer after my freshman year here at Brown, geography has remained one of the most important tools I use to make sense of the world. Reflecting upon the geographies specific to Brown brings into focus both the immense privilege and the weighty duty attached to our undergraduate experience.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Starting small, consider the geography of our jewel-like College Hill campus. Many of my friends know how much I love to lie on the grass on the Main Green, flanked by Sayles Hall, University Hall and Faunce House, feeling the Providence sun’s warmth on my cheeks or meditating in the trees’ cool shade and then posting a photo on Instagram with the hashtag #BrownUniversity. The Main Green is the heart of campus, the origin of so much of the university’s life. It hosts orientation events and commencement ceremonies, Spring Weekend concerts and quiet vigils, protests and celebrations. Students, administrators, faculty and staff members cross paths with people whom they may never meet otherwise and walk in the footsteps of all those who have animated Brown through the centuries. On a campus that extends from the Jewelry District to Ives Street and for a community with roots all over the world, the Main Green is a point of unity — geographically and spiritually.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the pristine and functional condition of the Main Green doesn’t come easy. In fact, it requires sustained effort throughout the year. Facilities workers salt and plow the sidewalks when it freezes and snows, build and dismantle stages and rows of chairs for special events and aerate and seed the lawns each spring. Despite the wear and tear of harsh winters and repeated trampling, the Main Green is ceaselessly renewed and cherished by the Brown community. And just as we acknowledge the efforts that have produced today’s Main Green in all its shimmering glory, we must never forget the labor of the slaves who built University Hall or, in more recent decades, the student activism that has used this space to shape the more inclusive university we attend today.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, the geography of the Brown experience extends far beyond the Main Green. From my hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, I have flown into T. F. Green Airport at the beginning of each semester. I have ventured by train to New York and Philadelphia and interned in Boston during the summer. I have studied abroad in Paris, and then again in London, and explored nearby cities like Brussels and Vienna. Each member of the class of 2017 has her own story of movement and wanderlust: coming to the United States for the first time as an international student, transferring to Brown from another college or volunteering in the Providence community. The local, national and global mobility available to Brown students thanks to the University’s alumni network and study abroad opportunities is stunning.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rather than disconnecting us from Brown, time away from campus contributes immeasurably to our education. I carry with me at Brown all of the places I have visited and all of the lessons I have learned from them: lessons about my own capabilities and limitations, about the way people in other states and on different continents live, about language and cuisine and class and politics. The challenge now is to put all of those lessons to work in the service of society. Just as protecting the Main Green from chaos and decay demands hard work, so too will constructing the future to which we aspire require great sacrifice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As we look beyond College Hill, the task before us is made even more daunting by the fact that we will no longer be tethered to Brown. When we first marched through the Van Wickle Gates at Convocation, it was as if we were sketching the first line on a map of our undergraduate journeys. During our four or more years here, we have filled in this map, sometimes hesitantly, often boldly. As we pass through the Van Wickle Gates once more, we may feel as if we no longer need this map that we have so meticulously drawn.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the personalized Brown geographies we have created will never be obsolete — we are merely turning to a blank page in our atlas. From the Main Green we will travel to San Francisco and Cape Town and Hong Kong and our hometowns and as-yet-unknown destinations. We will chart new maps. And surely, from time to time, we will flip back to the page labeled Brown, to reminisce and celebrate the special place to which we belong and to which we owe the unique privilege of serving the wider world.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>David Lazris: Brown in a quarter century</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/05/16/david-lazris-brown-quarter-century/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1982, an incoming freshman from New Jersey met his roommate, an international student from Pakistan. In their initial conversation, Andy Lazris ’86 and Syed Ejaz Husain ’86 MD’90 both quickly acknowledged that neither of them drank, but they agreed to begin college anew, attending a frat party on Wriston Quad that night. Pretending to drink from their cups but actually pouring their beer on the floor, they soon realized Wriston was not their social scene and left to spend the night talking in their room, quickly becoming friends. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Twenty-one years later in 2013, Syed and Andy reacquainted on Pembroke Green, both dropping off their children to meet their own college roommates at Brown. Syed’s daughter Fatima and I awkwardly sat over a Meeting Street Cafe brunch as these two friends relived their glory days.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While tied together by their room freshman year, their relationship went beyond simple friendship. Both Andy and Syed came in with intentions of entering medicine, Syed already guaranteed admission to the Warren Alpert Medical School through the eight-year Program in Liberal Medical Education. As Syed was new to America, he sought help in how to study, prepare for studying medicine and adjust to life in another country. My father convinced Syed to work at Brown over the summers cutting onions in the basement of the Ratty, while my father cleaned and painted boiler plants for Brown with local Providence residents. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both Fatima and I entered Brown with the same intention of studying medicine. Yet to be “pre-med” in 1982 was vastly different from what it meant in 2013. Both Fatima and I were told that scrubbing boiler plants would probably not meet medical school admission requirements; instead, we were pushed to do medical research at academic institutions. This is not to say that the older generation did not work as hard<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— Syed would wake up before sunrise in order to save study spaces for Andy and other friends on the 12th floor of the Sci Li so they could study throughout the weekend. In the same space of the upper floors of the Sci Li, Fatima and I have met many times to delve into subjects like organic chemistry and seek advice from each other about anything from summer employment to plans for the weekend. Though generations apart, in both ours and our fathers’ experiences inclusion and collaboration superseded the competitive nature of the pre-med track. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As with their focus on inclusion, Brown students have always prided themselves on fostering a socially progressive and forward-thinking campus community. This past fall, the election seemed over when talking to students on campus, with Hillary Clinton the clear projected victor. We envisioned an era of progress continuing through her presidency and a brighter future ahead. Yet as the results trickled in Nov. 8 and news organizations predicted a Donald Trump victory, an eerie and disturbing silence permeated campus. Walking home that night, I did not see a single person on the street. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 1984, the Brown campus was similarly optimistic about Walter Mondale’s prospects of defeating incumbent Ronald Reagan. When the results were announced, there was a similar shockwave sent through campus, with students bewildered by the massive margin by which Reagan won. In both generation’s college careers, America voted for a president whose beliefs ran counter to the Brown norm of social progressivism. Thirty-two years later, Brown students’ commitment to social progress remains an important and distinctive part of the university’s culture. The policies and candidates have changed, but Brown remains on the forefront of pushing for increased equality in the political and social spheres.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thirty years later, Andy and Syed are still in constant communication, whether it be about politics, medicine or their children. Their friendship has flourished, though Syed lives in Iowa and my father in Maryland. As I look forward to my future, I cannot help but look back at their past. Though different in many ways, Brown and the inclusion, collaboration and social advancement it upholds are still prevalent on this special campus.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Daniel Murage: A friend and a book</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have often been asked what my favorite book is or asked friends what their favorite books are. This is always a curious question, mostly because it offers an opportunity to learn about what the other person cares about without having to make them feel uncomfortable. In this same fashion, I will give you an account of my favorite book.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice,” is the first sentence of “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel García Márquez. The first time I read this sentence in June 2015 my hopes and goals were solidified — I was now certain that I wanted to be a writer. Later that summer, I read half of “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” But I haven’t gotten to finish the book yet — every time I open it, I reread half of the story twice, sometimes thrice, then end up going to the beginning and starting all over again.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My journey with Márquez did not begin in 2015. During the first week of my freshman year, my roommate, Eduardo, mentioned that his favorite book was “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” and he recommended that I read the book in Spanish. That semester, I took an introductory Spanish class. Three years later, I started reading “One Hundred Years of Solitude” and enjoyed it immensely.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But why am I not able to bring myself to finish reading “One Hundred Years of Solitude”? Every time I read the book, I have always enjoyed it to such an extent that I dread having to finish it, as I may not have a story to look forward to! This semester, I decided to get a first-edition copy of the book. It arrived in the mail three weeks ago. It is rugged, a bit torn and smells of old paper, but hey, it’s a first-edition book! I hope that this will be motivation enough to finish reading it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And just like my relationship with my favorite book, I have been hesitant to come to terms with the fact that I’ll be leaving Brown. Brown has been my home. I have made great friends, established relationships with mentors and received numerous opportunities for personal and academic growth. For these, I know that I will not really be leaving Brown — I hope that the friendships I have made and the connections that I have fostered at Brown will continue to thrive past College Hill.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And as I come to terms with leaving Brown and reflect on how Brown introduced me to my best friend and my favorite book, this connection has always made me wonder: If I had decided to leave Brown after that first week of my freshman year, how would my life have turned out? Would I still be friends with Eduardo? Would I be inspired by Márquez? Would I want to be a writer? Would I be narrating or writing about this incident somewhere else?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am not sure. But what I am sure about is this: During my first week at Brown, I met Eduardo, who shared stories of his life with me. Eduardo became my best friend, and his favorite book became the kind of book that I hope to someday write. During my first week at Brown, I gained friendship and purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Over four years here, I have met wonderful people and been afforded numerous opportunities. I have learned, and I hope that I have inspired. And if I am lucky enough, just like Eduardo, I hope that I, along with the rest of the class of 2017, will have set someone else’s life on a different path.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homesickness has plagued me for longer than I would like to admit. One of my only memories from pre-school is crying by the classroom door after my mom dropped me off for the day. Once<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>my parents went back to Pennsylvania after visiting me during family weekend of my sophomore year of college, I got in my bed and sobbed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During my first semester at Brown, I remember asking a junior who was in a group project with me when Brown would feel like home to me. “Around Thanksgiving break sophomore year,” she said. It was oddly specific and further off than I had anticipated, but I was hopeful and excited to develop some sort of place attachment to the university where I’d chosen to spend the next four years of my life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thanksgiving came sophomore year and, indeed, some friends had begun referring to their dorm rooms as home. When friends would send me texts saying they were studying at home, I had gotten into the habit of replying, “Wait what?! Do you mean New Jersey or like Harkness?” For a lot of my peers, home now meant not only where they were from but also spaces at Brown. Not for me, though. I tried adding some Pinterest-recommended “homey” touches to my dorm room, but neither pictures of my family and high school friends nor the plant in my window sill that I named Buddy (RIP) could give me that meaningful connection with Brown that many claimed to have. For me, home was still in Pennsylvania with my mom, dad and brother whom I continued to count on for a space where I could be myself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But eventually the day came. When I said “home,” I meant Brown, not the blue and white house in Pennsylvania where I had grown up. I first said it on Dec. 14, 2015. I remember the exact day because, naturally, I posted a photo on Instagram to commemorate the moment with a sappy yet witty caption, and also because it had been something I had wanted to feel for the past two and a half years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In those years before I was capable of calling Brown home, I had known home to be much more than a physical place; it was, more importantly, a feeling. Brown is my home because of the people I have met here who have provided me with a sense of security in becoming who I aspire to be — a writer, a historian, a wannabe comedian, a mentor and a friend.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So, if you were to ask me about my home now, I would tell you about the intersection of Charlesfield and Thayer, the location that defaults to “Home” on my phone’s map app.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or I would mention sitting at a sticky table in the front cave at the Ratty with Maddy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or studying and watching strange YouTube videos in J. Walter Wilson with Kelsey and Baylor.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or 195 Angell Street and the Herald staffers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or my mentors’ offices in Peter Green and Sharpe Houses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or Unit 18 in West Andrews.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or the basement of Faunce with Lauren.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’d tell you about Brown.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You bend down to tie your laces. You think the shoes are funny-looking. They are made of cowhide, and you have never worn ones like these before. <i>You are traveling to America! Better wear something nice!</i> You giggle at their old-fashioned ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You stand up and twist the door knob. Light cascades into the room you are about to leave. You turn your head to the three of them. You say <i>Ma, Grandma, Grandpa, bye for now</i>. They say, <i>best of luck in America, call us if you need money</i>. Your heart warms but then sinks. You are about to leave them behind to fly solo on this one-way trip across the Pacific Ocean, with a return ticket purchased only for an unknown point in the vastness of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet this is not the time for tears. You pucker up the edges of your lips, wishing that their last image of you be your smiley creases. You close the door of the familiar Confucian East behind you, and you open another into the wild Anglo-Protestant West. In this prestigious, elite and freethinking institution that was not originally built for people like you, you will stop speaking the language you have known for your whole life, and you will adopt a foreign tongue to help yourself thrive.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After 24 hours, dragging along 100-pound bags and flying 6,800 miles, your eyes are bloodshot. At the first mingling event, you meet some of your classmates — hundreds of them. They are busy getting to know each other, and you aren’t sure you even speak the same English as they do. You manage to squeeze a sentence out, <i>can I join your group? I don’t want to be left alone</i>. You are a little self-conscious, and they just smile.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Language isn’t the true barrier. Culture is. It is a chiffon scarf softly covering your eyes. It is gentle and at times almost invisible. Yet its existence makes every decision slightly more effortful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On your way to class, there is this three-story house with a vast backyard where little blond children throw balls at each other. On your way home after a late night at the Sci Li, there are these lights that keep every shop on Thayer Street illuminated at 2 a.m. On your food trips, there are the gigantic soda cups at Johnny Rockets and the humongous popcorn bags at Eastside Marketplace. You wonder why a family here needs such huge spaces when children in another neighborhood not far away play by the curb. You wonder if it is a waste of energy to keep buildings lit all night. You wonder if the food here makes you fat. You are a little concerned.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The new iPhone comes out, and it is all the buzz in your dorm. Neighbors jump up and down with their new toys, gathering together taking selfies. You also need a new phone; your current one is in a sorry state. You are a little self-conscious as you listen to their laughter, and you swear that you will get one, too. You tutor algebra. You watch people swim. You peel avocados at Andrew’s. You chop salads at Jo’s. At this rate, next year, perhaps, you will have a replacement, too. <i>It’s the waiting that makes a possession more valuable</i>. You tell yourself that that is true.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before you came, you were indoctrinated with the idea that your place of origin makes you inferior in America. You were told that America is not the post-racial country it aspires to be. Heads pop out of a passing car on Hope Street and yell <i>chink</i> at you, and so that is confirmed. You shrug it off. You are only a visitor, and therefore you don’t count in their demographics, right? It is their ignorance anyway. You are self-conscious, but they just laugh and drive away.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You feel foreign, utterly foreign.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While you are working to get a new phone, something else bugs you, too. There are some knots at the center of your existence. They reside in the veins where your blood flows; in the muscles that move you around; in the nostrils where oxygen comes out and in; in the eyes where your tears secrete and gunk accumulates. Most importantly, they are in the brain where your identity is constructed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You are scared. You are utterly scared. You aren’t allowed to be anything but heterosexual. This was never part of the plan. How would you navigate life with this clandestine identity? How would you respond to your conservative friends’ slurs and jokes? How would you respond to aggressors, especially if they are family? Your head spins everyday for an answer. You make a pact with yourself to put on a perfect show of concealment. You watch your words, your steps, your posture and your breathing. Your clothes could speak too much, and your laughter could give it away. You are self-conscious, and they? That is the question you want an answer to but could never ask.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You decide that you have had enough. You decide that you need to break out of this shell. It has been too long since any light visited your cell, like the day when you first left home for Brown and light filled up your room, feeding you with warmth and strength for this journey you then embarked on. You need that again in your life. You speak up. One day after the next, you untie the knots that have bound you for so long. One after another, your true friends filter through the funnel. You are self-conscious, but they embrace you and tell you that you are loved and protected. It will be an ongoing struggle, but you have taken the first step.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You have fallen in love with what you study. Books pile up high on your desk as you read about subjects that would have been too bizarre to even cross your mind just a few years ago. You spend days and nights with your eyes half open (or half closed) in the Rock, pounding keys on the qwerty board until a single more glance at your thesis hurts your eyes. The day you give your thesis presentation you are a little self-conscious, but they applaud and cheer you on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Four years after arriving, I am dressed in regalia at Commencement. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Four years after arriving, I become the first college graduate in my family. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Four years after arriving, the barrier called culture has decreased in magnitude. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Four years after arriving, I sometimes stutter in my native tongue and am more eloquent in this foreign one. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Four years after arriving, I no longer envy my neighbor’s new phone. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Four years after arriving, I realize being who I am is the source of my strength. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Four years after arriving, I still don’t know what the future holds. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Four years after arriving, I am writing for the Commencement Magazine, and I do not know how to write the ending. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Four years after arriving, I realize I do not have to write any ending, for what I have is enough.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Lainie Rowland: Anything but a cheesy column</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My senior year of high school I wrote a paper for my AP Language class trying to figure out what makes going to college worth the money. I could not actually answer the question, so the resulting paper was tragically bad. I argued that experiences combined with academics define college, making it a unique experience worth the investment for those ready to take advantage of it. A canned essay searching for a silver bullet-type answer, it read like a cheesy college brochure written by a pseudo-intellectual without a high school degree. Which it was. Not only was my argument flimsy and poorly articulated, but it was also premised on a set of hypothetical first-hand experiences that I obviously could not back up.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fast forward four years, and here we are. I hope I have already convinced you that my writing has improved since then (and if I have not, you should probably stop reading). In addition to some technical improvements, I now possess some first-hand experience that could inform a legitimate answer to the question I first posed in that shamelessly titled essay, “Not for School but for Life we Learn.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Surprisingly, though, I do not feel any more capable of offering a definitive answer to the question than I did four years ago. In the jumbled mess of my original paper, I touched on the importance of developing social skills and a professional network as a means of extracting value from a traditional college experience. I have certainly done that at Brown. I talked about “getting your money’s worth” by engaging with professors and academic advisors. Again, I have done that. Learning time management? Check. Leadership roles in clubs? Check. Got my money’s worth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From what I can decipher, high-school Lainie placed a premium on career readiness as a means of justifying the expense of college. Re-reading my paper, I cringed at one particularly laughable quote — “Colleges are smart; course requirements exist for a reason, and the classes needed to fulfill a major can be the foundation for many different career paths.” Open curriculum aside, Brown was a worthwhile transaction in this sense insofar as I am now able to say that I have secured a job. But this narrow, contractual answer feels unsatisfying. I went to college knowing it to be a concrete path toward gainful employment, but that does not make college “worth it” as much as it plainly describes the nature of the society in which we live. And I still have trouble making the argument that the many intangible elements of the Brown experience — all the cliches about friendships and late nights and misadventures — can be put on one side of an equation in order to balance the cost of attendance on the other side. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rather, I will say that Brown was a great wingman for many of my best relationships, whether they be social, intellectual or otherwise. Brown staged a setting conducive to four years of deep learning. Brown also provided a wealth of resources for my endeavors. But both the growth I have experienced over the past four years and the role of a college education in bringing me to this point are intangible and hard to define. Ironically, the clearest thing they have in common are their contributions to my increased ability to embrace uncertainty. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If I were to write the same paper now, I would spin off some jargon about the utility of a college degree as a signaling mechanism and as a vehicle for preserving the current distribution of wealth and power in the United States. I might even entertain some philosophical yarn about utilitarian methods of defining and calculating worthiness — the narrower the definition, the easier the fulfillment. I would also acknowledge that a school like Brown is well-positioned to prepare us for a career, life and so on. I would write that even the understanding I have developed while here about what it is like to go to Brown — what’s great about it, what’s frustrating and what to get at the GCB — does not make me qualified to deliver a judgment on my broad question. Other than being marked by a degree ceremony, the end of my college experience provides no singularly profound message. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I would like to think that my willingness to accept this open-endedness is reflective of my increased comfort with a world enmeshed in ambiguities and uncertainty. If that is the case, then I suppose I have come full circle. To that end, maybe walking through the Van Wickle Gates has some inherent metaphorical meaning. But this time around, I do not have to write a cheesy essay to prove its worth. So I wrote this one instead.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I cannot begin to quantify the number of parties I have attended with Steff and Stefan where we have taken over the music. From tiny dorm rooms to large bars, the three of us are constantly arriving somewhere, deciding we want to hear something different and asserting our musical tastes on everyone else, grinning with glee when we hear other people blurting, “I love this song!” and watching everyone, including ourselves, begin to dance embarrassingly in corners. Almost all the socializing I’ve done over my four years as a Brunonian has been with one or both of these people standing next to me, letting me analyze every room, putting up with my overly large arm gestures when I get excited and, of course, dancing late into the night.</p>
<p class="p2">Everyone has her story of her first interaction with a future first-year roommate, whether it was a stilted email exchange or a near-automatic Facebook friend request. Steff, however, followed me on Twitter. Our first real conversation happened when she responded to a tweet I had posted with Bon Iver lyrics — apparently my musical tastes came as a pleasant surprise to her. While we always got along as roommates, I can pin down the start of our actual friendship to the night when we sat, lights off, on our respective beds, separated by 10 or so feet of Keeney linoleum, blasting Kanye West’s recently released album, “Yeezus.” We sat there in the dark, maybe once mumbling, “This is really good,” for the entire duration of the album. When I came home a few weeks later and she had fallen asleep midday with a Fleetwood Mac song I grew up with playing softly on her computer, I knew that Brown’s mysterious first-year-roommate algorithm had definitely worked out for us.</p>
<p class="p2">I met Stefan through a variety of embarrassing circumstances I will not describe here, but when I was barely friends with him, I found myself sitting on his desk chair late at night after a string of likely mediocre freshman parties, watching the music video for Stromae’s song, “Papaoutai.” We marveled at its creativity, the hypnotic wonder of the dance moves, the colors. He soon became a fixture in Steff’s and my room, pregaming for Friday nights out, discussing our beyond-boring applied math professor and strategizing for the housing lottery.</p>
<p class="p2">Sophomore year, the two of them lived down the hall from each other while I lived with a roommate in a dorm a few blocks away. When my roommate’s taste for nothing but The Smiths became too much to bear, I would walk over to Marcy House, and the three of us would sit in Stefan’s tiny single, where the soundtrack was always FKA Twigs, Grimes, Lana del Rey and Lorde.</p>
<p class="p2">Junior year we mostly played dance music and forced everyone we knew to listen to Skrillex’s “Stranger” — a lot. We blared Diplo on weekdays and synced up Keys N Krates to strange and silly Youtube videos. On quieter evenings, Stefan would request Alt-J, and the three of us would talk, planning our futures both separately and apart: Stefan, an international student, had no idea where he would be in the world, and Steff would adamantly refuse to return to Florida, but beyond that, she did not know what would happen. Every time we talked about post-Brown life, I would always say, as a lifelong Brooklynite, “I’ll be in New York, so come visit.”</p>
<p class="p2">And both of them did: Stefan and I once yelled song requests to an overwhelmed-looking bartender in a noisy bar frequented by Columbia students, and Steff came to visit one summer when we bought tickets to see Flume. Barely 21, we were nearly the oldest people there, laughing at the dolled-up high-schoolers while we just danced and danced.</p>
<p class="p2">Senior year has been a blur of Stefan and I dancing in the living room to M.I.A.’s latest album while Steff and I debate which Rihanna song to play at Captain Seaweed’s. I am going to miss every time we played Cher’s “Believe” to end our nights out and every time we have cracked up at the sound of “Sweet Dreams” by the Eurythmics, which inevitably recalls that time a friend hijacked the music and only played that song for an unbearable 30 minutes straight at a party we threw in my Young Orchard apartment.</p>
<p class="p2">To Steff and Stefan, who have let me play “Collard Greens” by Schoolboy Q as many times as I have wanted, who will end up at business school in North Carolina and teaching math in India, respectively: Thank you for sharing your musical tastes with me for four years, and I cannot wait for you to come back to New York so we can dance in my living room for years to come.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Lindsey Taing: Chill out</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I entered Brown with big aspirations, wide eyes and a hope for something incredible. Like many of my peers, I was the valedictorian and president of many different clubs in high school. But after my freshman year, I soon realized that almost every Brown student was accustomed to past success. Brown was a community engulfed in talent, passion and drive. I felt lost trying to find my own personal success in a pool of common achievement. I wondered how I could make any substantial impact on such a vibrant community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> My parents are Cambodian genocide refugees who ingrained in me a drive to become the absolute best version of myself and prioritized education as a privilege for which they were once persecuted. With that drive rooted in my mind, I wanted to excel in every facet of life. I had high expectations for myself, as so many other students at Brown do. I pushed myself; I saw my peers push themselves. Everyone I knew worked incredibly hard to meet their own expectations. It was all too common for someone outside the community to assume Brown was “chill” and even lacked “real” grades. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Brown students, we could all collectively sigh over those assumptions. We definitely had grades — you can check my transcript for proof. Though Brown is known for being stereotypically “chill,” our all-nighters at the Sci Li, crying in the stacks and mental breakdowns would argue otherwise. We worked tirelessly. I was plagued by the idea of being chill even as so many of us had studied 50 hours for a final exam or paper and still received a grade that felt inadequate. My close friends and I often felt like we lacked a definitive achievement. Many times we would question if we belonged here and if our accomplishments mattered. I had thought Brown was chill, but it seemed taboo to talk to anyone if you were struggling.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After my freshman spring, I felt inadequate and lost at Brown. It felt like a mistake to be among so many brilliant and successful peers. I thought I would transfer to another school where my perceived lack of success would be less burdensome. I filled out a transfer form and stared at it for days. I never told anyone. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sophomore year, I was determined to find a version of success that would be satisfying. I took five classes for the next five semesters, feeling like I had to prove myself. I pushed myself — far from the supposed “chill” Brown was supposed to have. I spent almost 13 hours studying in the Sci Li basement every day. I worked the hardest my body physically could. Even if my body suffered, I continued. The one instance in which I sought help, I contacted a dean. I had three exams on the same day, and none of them could be moved. The dean suggested I “time manage.” I cried in the fifth floor stacks. I cried almost every day of sophomore year, and my health deteriorated. I was miserable, but no one knew as I kept the darkness locked inside.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As I continued to see a lack of success in myself, I began to lose self-worth and the motivation to continue my education. Despite my crumbling mental state, no one knew the extent to which I suffered. I was notoriously perky and smiley; I donned a resting “nice face.” I was an upbeat and caring individual, so it seemed simple to pretend I was “okay” on the outside. The facade I had created hid all pain. I did not want anyone to know about my feelings of inadequacy and unhappiness. I did not want pity; I wanted to deal with it myself. I could not imagine how many other students related to me and felt uncomfortable talking about it. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, I realized I was not okay. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. At first, I even struggled to tell my family. For the next three years, I continued to battle with my mental health and the image that I was supposed to be “relaxed” and “chill” while succeeding in all aspects of life. I painted this image to show others that I had it all together, but I did not. Every day felt dark, as if there were no escape. I had completely lost myself. Junior year, I still probably cried every other day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before I knew it, I was a senior, jaded and unexcited about things that used to grab my attention. After three years on campus, I finally sought out open discussions with peers about my mental health. I was tired of letting critical views of failure take over my life. I started allowing myself to see what made Brown a facilitating, encouraging learning environment. I was able to see how many people related to me and how receptive students on campus could be to truthfully talking about the implications of mental health. The topic did not have to be taboo. I came to appreciate the impact that this campus has had on my life. I was not alone, and I never was. I could acknowledge that maybe I was not okay, but I did belong here. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Throughout the debilitating mental illness, Brown has allowed me to become resilient while connecting me with passionate, caring people whom I consider lifelong friends. I am incredibly thankful that I never submitted that college transfer form and made it through this journey along with my classmates. You are never alone at Brown, and maybe we are considered “chill” because we are driven yet also enthusiastic, empathetic and excited. Maybe I am not inherently chill and am all too Type A, but I am myself. And after three years of what seemed impossible to escape, I am genuinely happy. Thank you, Brown.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Jaclyn Torres: Finding friendship through food</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/05/16/jaclyn-torres-finding-friendship-food/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can learn a lot about a person over a meal. My best friends at Brown share my love of food and, in many cases, a similar eating schedule. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Every fall, I cherish the inaugural dinner of the semester, before classes start and when the only people in the dining halls are athletes and students participating in orientation programs. The meal celebrates the start of preseason and the return of hang-out sessions across the various dining halls on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My first friendships at Brown, those with my teammates, were built through hours of conversation at the V-dub, sitting around a circular table after a long day of field hockey. Sometimes the only energy we had we poured into fueling our bodies for the next day. The only sound was the clink of utensils against bowls and plates, the thud of a cup against the wooden surface. Other times we rehashed the day and discussed what we were looking forward to that semester.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Slowly, our meals came to revolve around conversations about classes, our likes and dislikes, our hopes and goals both short-term and long-term. The depth of our meal conversations did not happen overnight, nor did we realize the strength of our friendship until the end of the semester when finals hit and free time became limited. As I sat in the absolute quiet room of the Rock late one night, I experienced a profound sense of loss. I had been too busy to meet up with friends for meals and instead had eaten alone while analyzing a text or writing a paper.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A few weeks later, I felt whole again. Three teammates and I sat around a circular table discussing what transpired over winter break. To a stranger, our conversation would have seemed mundane — the classic retelling of the day, discussion of the time spent apart — but I soaked in every detail, refusing to part with the stories that I lived through vicariously. It was in that moment that I understood the importance of sharing a meal with friends.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I cherish meals with friends both for the verbal and the nonverbal conversation. Most days, a simple glance or a comical people-watching moment prompts a fit of laughter in my friends and me that only subsides after a serious ab workout and tears running down our cheeks. Sometimes, meals soothe the frustration of a poor grade or a tense relationship. It is simply having someone to sit next to you and spend time with you that makes the dining experience worth it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">More than through just the content of the conversation, I have come to understand the nuances of my friends’ personalities through dining with them. A meal can reveal a person’s sense of adventure or how they handle stress; it can bring to light their degree of introversion or extroversion. Some of the traits might be considered extraneous to knowing a person, like the fact that one of my friends is obsessed with olives and will eat them with anything, and another has a penchant for pairing cereal with ice cream or peanut butter depending on the day. These little preferences are important to me and make for an unforgettable meal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My four years at Brown were shaped by mealtime. Every day was a new experience, and every meal provided me with comfort, hope and refuge. I am going to deeply miss the long conversations over dining-hall meals, but I will always have my friends to reminisce on those memories with me and create new ones in the next place I call home.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This summer, students received word that Brown is switching the management of its student health insurance plan to Gallagher Student Health, an insurance company that provides plans for a multitude of universities nationwide. While this might seem like a technicality, the change creates another difficult hurdle for students who are trying to figure out their own affordable coverage options for the school year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those who haven’t been following the minutiae of Brown’s health insurance process, here’s a quick recap: Each year, the University automatically enrolls every undergraduate in its health insurance plan, which this year costs $3,615 for coverage. Students with existing insurance (myself included) can apply to opt out of this plan, an action that is termed a “hard waiver.” These students have to fill out paperwork that proves that they have existing coverage months before the start of the actual academic year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But when it took charge of the new health insurance plan, Gallagher made a promise that “all submitted waiver request forms will be subject to a new and more robust waiver verification.” In practice, this resulted in confusion for people who had waived their insurance in previous years. For me, this meant being rejected because, according to a formulaic email from Gallagher, “the location of your school is outside of your insurance company service area.” For a school that touts its geographic diversity and the inclusion of a variety of lived experiences, this is a pretty low blow, Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University is right to automatically enroll and try to maintain students in its plan; like the Obamacare mandate, the goal is to stabilize premiums while maintaining high-quality care for all students. But I question the University’s opaque methods, as well as its outsourcing to a new third-party company.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What some students may not know is that this insurance comes additional to the annual $950 Health Services Fee that all students are charged for regardless of insurance status. The fee funds most, if not all, of the services that students use for routine issues during college. This means that many of the benefits that Gallagher touts — including primary physician visits, EMS ambulance services, mental health counseling, certain lab tests and preventative services — are already covered for all students, as long as they are done on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gallagher and Brown argue that their coverage goes beyond the health services fee, and this is probably necessary for people without any insurance. But I am also under my parents’ extensive Kaiser Permanente plan, which covers pharmacy, urgent care, immediate surgery and emergency room visits nationwide. Which brings up the question: Exactly what are students like me paying for with this new health insurance plan? If something is not life-threatening or a day-to-day issue, I can wait to go home and see my own provider for options. If I have to deal with an immediate health issue on campus, I am already covered in Rhode Island hospitals because of my parents’ health insurance plan and with Health Services because of the Health Services Fee. Anything else is money straight into the insurer’s pockets.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moreover, for students who do not even have insurance, the lack of knowledge and transparency is a major obstacle. Some students are unaware, for example, that there is a separate application for financial aid assistance for health insurance that is not covered in the normal aid package (out-of-state Medicaid is also not an accepted plan). And the early deadline of the waiver process, combined with the language of a “more robust waiver verification,” left families unsure all summer if their insurance — in other words, if Medicaid, Blue Shield, Kaiser and other such packages, especially those out of state — would be accepted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In my case, my waiver was accepted for the last two years despite the fact that the policy explicitly stated that Kaiser was not comparable. But with the last-minute change in management and my unexpected waiver rejection, I am stuck in limbo this year, carrying two nearly identical plans and having to budget over $4,000 into an already exorbitant tuition co</span><span class="s1">st.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the end of the day, Gallagher is an insurance company that operates on profit margins. The entire waiving process, from the early deadlines to the confusing third-party sites, seems to be designed to make it difficult for students to opt out of their plan. A Gallagher-sponsored study titled, “Student Health: The Hidden Mission of Colleges and Universities,” even discusses the positives that universities make insurance mandatory or use hard waivers . But Brown should think twice before following this advice: Gallagher is not on our side. In fact, it heavily markets itself to colleges because students are one of its consistent sources of income. If Brown continues to choose this misguided path, it should at least work harder to clarify language and offer alternative options without lowering the level of coverage offered.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Everyone should have comprehensive insurance — that goes without saying. The important question is how to best ensure this. On a nationwide level, that means debating the Obamacare mandate and insurance marketplaces, policy chan</span><span class="s2">ges and coverage providers. At a university level, it means starting a dialogue on the value of having one plan forced upon — and then suddenly changed on — undergraduate students. Brown is placing at least some of the responsibility of student health on a new company without student input or transparency. It can and should do better than that.</span></p>

		<title>Mitra &#039;18: Harriet Tubman deserves top billing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the one hand, we have <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p1535.html">Harriet Tubman</a>, a humanitarian and abolitionist who dedicated her life to fighting for the freedom of enslaved people. She risked her life as a spy for the Union Army, spent years guiding others to liberty and eventually became the most famous “conductor” on the Underground Railroad. Over a century after her death, Tubman is still synonymous with the best this country has to offer.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On the other hand, we have <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/andrew-jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, one of the most reviled presidents in American history. He was a slave owner and a fierce defender of slavery and “states’ rights.” He signed the infamous Indian Removal Act, which led to the brutal displacement of the Cherokee Nation during the Trail of Tears. His memory will forever be linked to his cruelty toward people of color.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The decision about which of these figures deserves to grace the $20 bill — one of the most <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_currcircvolume.html">common notes in circulation</a> — should be a no-brainer. The Obama administration seemed inclined to think so, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/us/women-currency-treasury-harriet-tubman.html?mcubz=0">announcing a plan</a> to move Jackson to the back of the $20 bill and give Tubman top billing (pun intended).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But the Trump administration has now indicated that it may move in a different direction. In August, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/31/us/politics/mnuchin-harriet-tubman-jackson-money.html?mcubz=0">still “consider(ing)”</a> the decision to swap out Jackson for Tubman on the bills.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While raising doubts on the future of the plan, Mnuchin <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/31/treasury-secretary-steve-mnuchin-just-put-harriet-tubmans-role-on-the-20-bill-in-question.html">told CNBC,</a> “We’ve got a lot more important issues to focus on.” And in many ways, that is true. Compared to the far-reaching economic and social ills plaguing this country, the images on paper currency are largely symbolic. Yet this symbolism sends a powerful message about the values the Trump administration has decided to stand for — and those it has ignorantly cast to the side. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Like the debate over monuments, the argument over the $20 bill is about the kind of history we wish to honor. But there is one major distinction: U.S. dollar bills are not historical artifacts created in another era. They infiltrate almost every aspect of our lives and are still printed today. They are therefore a living testament to the principles the government has chosen to commemorate; they do not only reflect the past, but also make a statement about the present.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">By declining to commit to a swap of Tubman for Jackson, the Trump administration has shown once again that it does not take the concerns of people of color and marginalized communities seriously. It is not hard to imagine why these groups might object to keeping Jackson on the $20 bill. Americans whose ancestors have suffered from his ruthless treatment should not have to stare at his face every day.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yet President Trump has been an outspoken admirer of Jackson in the past, even hanging a portrait of the seventh president in the Oval Office. By contrast, he said that it would be “more appropriate” to cast Tubman on the $2 bill — the note that circulates in the smallest volume. That statement in itself says much about his worldview.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But it’s not just about Jackson and Tubman. It is long past time to make our paper currency more inclusive and egalitarian. Given the range of American heroes from diverse backgrounds — from Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth to Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks — it is ridiculous that the only figures honored on our bills are white men. Correcting this oversight is not a question of erasing history. It’s about acknowledging that marginalized communities had a role in shaping this country. It’s about sending a message to all Americans that their historical role models can be as diverse as the communities around them. And it’s about truly learning to celebrate the melting pot this country is.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Former “West Wing” actor Josh Malina has suggested that people write “Harriet Tubman” across the front of <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/348786-former-west-wing-star-urges-people-to-write-harriet-tubman-on-20-bill">$20 bills in an act of resistance</a>. That is certainly a creative thought, though it is probably easier to take that stand when you’re a wealthy actor rather than, say, a college student on a tight budget. Low- and middle-income Americans cannot and should not be expected to throw away their money for ideological reasons. Still, Malina is onto something: Americans everywhere need to continue pushing the Trump administration — and indeed, future administrations — to rethink its approach to the imagery on U.S. currency. The same groundswell of advocacy that convinced the Obama administration to propose the change in the first place could well be effective once again.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the meantime, we should just be thankful that Trump has not decided to put his own face on the $20 bill. Given his track record so far, it might only be a matter of time.</span></p>

		<title>Okin &#039;19: In light of hate, choose community</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The iconic Rabbi A.Y. Kook once said, “I don’t speak because I have the power to speak; I speak because I don’t have the power to remain silent.” This statement encapsulates the visceral obligation I feel to the Jewish community to react: to scream when swastiskas stain high school walls, to cry when bomb threats desecrate the once-comforting <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/27/517539505/bomb-threats-made-against-jewish-community-centers-in-11-states">Jewish Community Centers</a>, to write a column when an appearance by Pepe the Frog becomes common in a <a href="https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/pepe-the-frog">routine social media scroll</a>. As Rabbi Kook explains, the insuppressible urge to do something is prompted by my inability to do nothing. Moreover, I think this inability stems from a critical element of Judaism that is fundamental whether your identity is rooted in the religion’s cultural values or its pious traditions: the focus and dependence on community. It is the care and thus intuitive responsibility I feel toward the Jewish community and its members that has afforded me the confidence and motivation to advocate against hate. Consequently, I’ve come to believe that with stronger ties to the community comes a heightened ability to confront anti-Semitism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Okay, alright. I disavow, okay?” was our president’s exact response to inquiries about the support he received from fierce anti-Semite and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke — and this insignificant, seemingly indifferent attitude was not a one-time occurrence. In fact, the dismissal of the magnitude and significance of anti-Semitism has become quite a theme in this administration. From issuing a Holocaust remembrance memo without any mention of the millions of Jewish deaths to making the already-infamous insinuation that Nazis aren’t entirely rotten, President Trump constantly exposes his ignorant, detached and plainly uncaring attitude toward the severity of this kind of bigotry. While it is arguable whether the man is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/opinion/sunday/why-does-donald-trump-keep-dissing-jews.html?mcubz=0">raging anti-Semite</a> or simply a narcissist who hates rejecting his fans, what is undeniable is that Trump doesn’t internalize the value of community that has remained a cornerstone of Judaism. If he felt any sense of duty to the Jewish community, or the instinctive empathy a president ought to feel in the face of hatred, I am confident his responses to the evils committed would stop teetering on indifference. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, this column does not intend to focus on Trump’s incompetence in the area of moral courage. Rather, I want to suggest we do the opposite: Stop giving his inadequate defense of the Jewish people so much time and energy, and instead, use that strength to focus on being our own champions of change. Last year, Brown/RISD Hillel’s Rabbi Michelle Dardashti, while telling the story of the first people on earth, discussed the question of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ayyeka?” or “Where are you?” In response, she encouraged us to reflect on this question ourselves and confidently answer “Hineini” or “Here I am,” fearlessly presenting our Jewish identities to the world amid rampant anti-Semitism. In the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/24/525398277/anti-semitic-incidents-up-86-percent-compared-to-same-time-last-year">current resurgence of anti-Semitism</a>, to stand tall and announce your Jewish presence, to proudly declare this commitment to the worldwide community, is an act as brave as it is important. Fight against the hate by showing up fully with your Jewish identity, whether that connection stems from resonating with a religious element, a cultural value or something else entirely. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is easily said, but the question for many still remains: How do you do this? Attending religious services could satisfy this desire for some, but there are so many other avenues to proudly exhibit a Jewish identity that suits your background. You can be a part of Jewish life on campus through means that truly resonate with who you are: craft for the holidays, bake challah for charity, attend a lecture featuring a Jewish novelist. Seek ways to connect with the Jewish community. A sense of devotion to the group and sincere engagement can offer the astonishing inability to remain silent. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The other day, I was pasting construction paper letters on a poster for Hillel’s booth at the activities fair when I began aimlessly cutting triangles. In a moment of utter genius, I realized that if rotated and overlapped, paired triangles could be glued on the paper to resemble Stars of David. But I froze: What if this iconic symbol of Judaism triggered an act of anti-Semitism? Immediately, images of the countless walls adorned with <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anti-semitism-charlottesville-shattered-glass_us_599dd9f0e4b0d97c40011880?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009">spray-painted slurs</a>, the confused children being frantically evacuated from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/opinion/a-place-for-water-aerobics-and-feeling-safe-as-american-jews.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0">JCCs nationwide</a>, the shattered remains of a wall of the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/14/holocaust-memorial-boston-damaged-for-second-time-this-summer/ujYan70j3kXzFWS3TGcZ0J/story.html">New England Holocaust Memorial</a> came to mind. This six-pointed symbol, and the implicit or conscious bias it evoked, could single-handedly produce so much hate and crime and tragedy. But suddenly a stronger thought took hold: The use of this emblem contains the history and carries the promise of an entire community — if we fully embrace it. It represents an identity, but only its owners have the power to paste it on their posters. Needless to say, I’m gluing my triangles together, and I encourage you to do the same. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’m not a particularly devout person. I don’t subscribe to any cults or fringe subcultures. (In the interest of transparency, I do follow Kylie Jenner on Instagram.) And I’ve never really wondered what happens to us after we kick the proverbial bucket. But if there ever is an apocalypse that reduces human civilization to smithereens, I’m pretty sure it’s going to look like the past few weeks: the unprecedented convergence of hurricanes in the Gulf, wildfires in California, and an earthquake in Mexico. Taken together, these disasters have <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2017/09/04/Hurricane-Irma-Florida-Harvey-death-toll/stories/201709040105">claimed</a> the lives of at least 60 people, left tens of thousands <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/hurricanes-harvey-irma-cost-us-economy-290-billion/story?id=49761970)">displaced</a> and could siphon close to $300 billion from the American economy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet, for our nation’s professional mythmakers, this dystopia was actually cause for celebration. President Trump <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/metropolis/2017/08/houston_doesn_t_showcase_america_at_its_best.html">claimed</a> that the disasters demonstrate “the best in America’s character — strength, charity and resilience.” Slideshows of heroic volunteers and emergency workers have proliferated on the internet. Even pets, left behind by evacuating families, have been able to bask under the limelight: It was widely <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/dozens-cats-dogs-flown-harvey-flooded-houston-article-1.3480331">reported</a> last week that Southwest Airlines flew 80 cats and dogs from Houston to San Diego to be adopted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cobbling together some optimism in the face of devastation is an admirable thing. The courage of our policemen and firefighters; the extraordinary selflessness of ordinary rescuers; the local <a href="http://time.com/4928206/harvey-daca-houston">organizing</a> of immigrants<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— all these are worth celebrating and deserve our sincerest gratitude. But, in the long run, our national habit of making myths out of even the most hellish of circumstances — out of rubble and watery ruins — while willfully sugarcoating the true horrors of disaster will spell our undoing. Harvey and Irma, after all, are not only stories of resilience and sacrifice; they are also tales of abject failure. In fact, every daring rescue made in the aftermath, every evacuee flying out of Florida, every vessel of the storied, all-volunteer Cajun Navy constitute failures of our society — our people’s collective negligence to heed the warnings of climate scientists; our policymakers’ failure to obey the evidence, not personal whim; and, worst of all, our entire culture’s failure to consider the human costs of climate inaction. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">More broadly, a sanitized, sentimentalized version of natural disaster does us no good. When we deliberately downplay the trauma and suffering with romanticized heroism, we undermine our own ability to proactively confront the causes and consequences of environmental crisis. We know that climate change — which many in our government and civil society have denounced as alarmist fiction‚ drastically increases the likelihood and severity of extreme weather <a href="http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-climate-change-natural-disasters-20170907-htmlstory.html">events</a> like hurricanes and wildfires. We know that we need smarter urban planning regulations to discourage development on exposed coastlines. We know we need to invest in infrastructure and better emergency planning to mitigate the effects of extreme weather in the future. But none of what we know can be meaningfully put into action if we’re too busy cheering the moments of valor and neighborliness and forget to question why that valor and neighborliness were necessary in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the whole, I’m glad disaster brought out the “best in America’s character;” I just wish we had been better, sooner, so that our best didn’t have to take the form of dangerous rescues and makeshift shelters. It’s become clear, now, that how we idealize our humanity during crises has proven to be a grave liability. Up until a few days ago, as droughts ravage sub-Saharan Africa and water advances on the low-lying shores of Bangladesh, the most destructive effects of climate change have spared the United States. But the reality of climate change is starting to encroach on our little idyll, in the once-impregnable upper latitudes of the northern hemisphere. We can no longer afford to get caught manufacturing myths for online virality, letting them blind us to the truth.</span></p>

		<title>Vilsan ’19: Robots or not?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The queue in front of me in the pharmacy was moving impressively fast, customers walking off with a handful of change less than a minute after placing their orders. As I glided forward, I couldn’t help but appreciate the efficiency. I speedily arrived to the front of the line, only to discover that the pharmacist who had been filling out my prescriptions since I was old enough to look over the counter had been replaced by a five-foot machine that took orders twice as fast and spit out exact change without so much as a “hmm.” And this wasn’t the first time this summer I’d come face to face with a machine where a worker used to be. Whether I was placing an order at McDonald’s or checking in my luggage at the airport, human assistance was becoming all but obsolete.</p>
<p class="p2">As technology makes its way into every nook and cranny of our day-to-day lives and artificial intelligence can be found in headlines everywhere, many students are wondering if they should be changing their majors or considering the tech industry. How can we, as students in the humanities, be sure our jobs are safe, when machines seem to be capable of anything these days? And is my job next?</p>
<p class="p2">Thankfully, no. As it turns out, the communications, critical thinking and creative skills that a well-rounded, humanities-based education provides are much-needed tools in the 21st century economy, and humanities students shouldn’t feel the need to compromise on their passions.</p>
<p class="p2">Admittedly, the fear of technology becoming the be-all and end-all of future careers is prominent among students who have not chosen a tech-related path. With Silicon Valley increasingly driving the economy and technology becoming irreplaceable in office buildings across America, students who are simply not interested in computer science — but are willing to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars into pre-professional or advanced education — are bound to have misgivings about their chosen path. And a superficial browse through the world wide web does nothing to assuage these worries. With screaming headlines promising robots will do your jobs without asking for healthcare benefits, it’s no wonder people are concerned. Deloitte <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3067279/you-didnt-see-this-coming-10-jobs-that-will-be-replaced-by-robots">estimates</a> that, in the next 10 years, close to 40 percent of jobs in the legal sector could be automated. After all that money spent on a legal education, those numbers are sure to send a shiver down the spines of prospective law students. But even if a robot doesn’t physically replace your job, it can often feel like you’re still in danger of being pushed out or overlooked if you didn’t jump on those CS classes in college. Billionaire Vinod Khosla <a href="http://bostonreview.net/science-nature/tom-slee-silicon-valley-liberal-arts-majors-we-want-you">says</a>, “Little of the material taught in liberal arts colleges today is relevant to the future.” How can you not worry?</p>
<p class="p2">The reality is that skills taught in liberal arts colleges are still valuable in the work force. Sure, some jobs are on their way out, and it doesn’t hurt to be somewhat technologically adept even if you’re not planning a career in the digital world. But us non-robots (and even tech virgins) have a saving grace: creativity. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/08/robots-will-not-take-your-job/">According</a> to Wired Magazine, a study on the impact of robots on jobs across 17 countries found that while technology reduces the hours of the average low-skilled worker, it doesn’t reduce the hours of the average human. In its current state, technology is doing more to boost job opportunities than it is to diminish them.</p>
<p class="p2">And when it comes to students passionately pursuing careers outside of the technological sphere, creativity and critical thinking will equip you for fruitful careers despite your digital handicap. One article in the New York Times with the comforting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/books/review/you-can-do-anything-george-anders-liberal-arts-education.html?_r=0">title</a>, “Don’t Panic, Liberal Arts Majors. The Tech World Wants You,” expresses that sentiment exactly. The skills taught in humanities are far from becoming unnecessary in the tech world. A broad humanities education, in fact, gives students diverse insights into a variety of fields — history, politics and economics, to name a few. This intellectual versatility translates into the professional world quite neatly. For example, being able to communicate a vision, whether you’re talking to clients or a future employer, that is informed by a multidimensional education is a skill that shouldn’t be underestimated. So, even if you’re considering a career in the tech world without embracing the tech, you’re in luck.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, if you’re a humanities student, it does help to have some exposure to CS. It is also the responsibility of society to make sure those who find their work on the cusp of automation can develop the skills necessary to reorient and reimagine their careers, rather than passively accepting replacement. As a international relations concentrator myself, I’ve opted to take introductory CS courses not because I want to work in Silicon Valley, but because a smidgen of tech skills can open up opportunities. The key here is to understand that humanities and technology are not at odds; they are complementary. As the economy continues to shift and grow, we — as students and as professionals — have a chance to redefine our futures. We shouldn’t be worried about being replaced. Instead, we should be interested in how we can apply our own passions, interests and capabilities in an evolving world. In short, humanities majors can let out a sigh of relief. Don’t fear being pushed to the margins; look forward to carving out your own place in your chosen career.</p>

		<title>Savello ’18: Maximizing language opportunities</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/12/savello-18-maximizing-language-opportunities/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In my first semester at Brown, I signed up for a Spanish class on a whim. Seated in HISP0600: “Advanced Spanish II” alongside a group of near-fluent students and upperclassmen, I was absolutely terrified when the professor called on me to read a paragraph aloud to the class. I had taken AP Spanish in high school, but we hardly ever spoke in class. I didn’t have the skills I needed to properly pronounce basic words, let alone read a literary text in Spanish. But by the end of the semester, after weeks of oral presentations, quizzes, class discussions and group projects, my Spanish skills significantly improved — as did my confidence, interpersonal skills and ability to express my ideas.</p>
<p class="p2">For me, this language class was not just a tedious requirement, but an opportunity to explore a different side of my education and develop my skillset. Unfortunately, not all Brown students take advantage of this opportunity. In fact, many students choose to forego language courses because of the lengthy time requirement — meeting up to four times a week for most sub-500 level courses and completing time-consuming assignments and projects. Other students take the plunge and begin a language, but eventually discontinue it. The stringent language requirement for International Relations concentrators, for example, forces many concentrators to switch to another discipline in the political realm.</p>
<p class="p2">But these students fail to realize the variety of benefits that come with putting a little extra work into picking up a new language or improving on one they already know. As I can personally attest, the value of speaking a foreign language and the personal growth that accompanies the process far outweigh the burden of extra coursework. We all know that being bilingual — or even multilingual — can boost your career prospects and simply help you connect with people from other cultures. What is less known is that it can also make you a better communicator overall: Once you start expressing yourself in a foreign language, doing the same in English seems effortless in comparison.</p>
<p class="p2">The large number of assignments in language classes may be off-putting for some, but in the long run, the coursework will only help. And because there are so many assignments, it is often not necessary to complete every single one to perfection in order to succeed in class. Most professors in the language departments are understanding and allow for paper extensions, offer support with lengthy projects and even set up plans to help you participate in class if you are nervous about speaking publicly in a new language.</p>
<p class="p2">Moreover, language professors often use a culture-focused approach, which allows students to learn not only about the language, but also about the associated cultures, from notable poets and songwriters to athletes and holidays.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many also incorporate immersive elements into the syllabi, giving students the opportunity to apply their skills outside the classroom.</p>
<p class="p2">Understanding the value of these courses, the University has established several activities and resources for students to get more involved with languages. For example, the language fair during first-year orientation informs new students about language opportunities and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>motivates students to explore these options. There are also student organizations like Brown Language Exchange and Charla, a Spanish conversational group, that allow students to informally learn languages.</p>
<p class="p2">Though campus resources and promotional events for language learning are abundant, accessibility is not. If the University truly wants students to take advantage of its language opportunities, it needs to address the leading issue that prevents students from signing up in the first place: heavy coursework and the excessive course hours. A simple solution would be to rework the time commitment of early language courses so that more students are able to enroll. And while it is necessary to consistently practice conversation to learn a language effectively, there are several alternatives to the TA-led sections that could provide the same results without the burden of additional class time. Adding more interactive homework activities, creating flexible or voluntary section hours or incorporating online speaking activities could all be potential solutions.</p>
<p class="p2">Ultimately, students need to take advantage of the language courses that are offered. To make that easier, Brown needs to reconsider how it structures language courses. Accessibility needs to be a priority if language departments hope to attract and retain students. For many students, college might be the last chance to diligently learn a language, and the University should ensure this opportunity is available to all.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">An immutable fact of life is that people talk. But when Brown students are frustrated, not all of us can feel better just by talking. Some of us yell, some argue and some even protest.</p>
<p class="p3">One of the first things I noticed when I got to college was the overwhelming lack of silence. While I appreciate the privileges that come with being a Brown student, I often find myself longing for a space in which opinions and outrage can coexist without megaphones and picketing signs.</p>
<p class="p3">I’ve found that if you want something done at Brown, you can either make noise or move out the way for someone louder to do it for you. No one ever asks the quiet kid to lead the movement. And I’m not saying we have to. But I often wonder how helpful a protest can really be to someone like myself, who is not as comfortable in these spaces as other students might be.</p>
<p class="p3">After the 2016 presidential elections, I felt an uncomfortable pressure, followed by what seemed like an obligation, to voice my outrage in the form of peaceful protest. I was obviously unhappy, but I mostly just wanted time to process what the president’s election actually meant for myself and for my family. I wanted to know why it had happened and what the politics were behind this unsettling rise of nationalism. Instead, my social media feeds were flooded with calls-to-action, and all people could talk about was what march they were going to attend next.</p>
<p class="p3">As a child, I was raised to mind my business and no one else’s. That meant if nobody was attacking me directly, I had no reason to get involved in another person’s drama. To a certain extent, this rule still applies in my household. I distinctly remember my mother warning me not to go and “embarrass myself” in public by going to an equal housing protest in Providence. “This is not your fight,” she reminded me. “Americans complain too much. Just keep your head down, focus on your grades and be grateful that you’re alive.”</p>
<p class="p3">And at the end of the school year, that is exactly what I had planned on doing. Then about halfway through the Summer@Brown program, for which I was a summer residential advisor, there were a series of demonstrations against summer employee wages and <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/07/25/university-offers-pay-raise-summerbrown-staff-addresses-allegations-racism/">unclear program policies</a>. I went to a couple of them, but truthfully, I was more concerned with what my mom would say than with the actual outcome of the protests. Losing my summer job was an expense I knew I could not afford, and yet still I felt this sense of urgency to act immediately by joining the movement.</p>
<p class="p3">In hindsight, I think that the mental pressure had a lot to do with the fact that these protests were headed by people of color. Since moving to the United States, I’ve found myself constantly (and reluctantly) having to prove my blackness — or rather, my authenticity as a black woman — to other people. And because of the way people of color have historically fought for liberation, protests, to me, feel more like tests of legitimacy. Can I really call myself oppressed if I’m not visibly fighting against the system?</p>
<p class="p3">But who’s to say I’m not fighting? In a way, I feel out of place at protests. It seems to me as if everyone there is passionately striving toward a common goal, and I’m just standing in for a friend who couldn’t make it. This isn’t because I lack empathy or anger; it’s simply because of the fact that when I speak, I like to have my individual voice heard. Like many other people in the world, my own voice is the only thing I have to offer. Further, not everyone can take the risk of getting arrested at a march, and while I applaud those who make that sacrifice, I also want to highlight the individuals who choose to sit on the sidelines for various reasons.</p>
<p class="p3">It’s easy for someone to dismiss a “problematic” opinion and walk away from the discussion, but I see plenty of opportunity in healthy conversation. Hearing the same story from different sides, sharing my own truths, even listening to opinions I may not agree with are my own forms of activism. Somewhere along the line, I was made to feel as if these aren’t good enough — as if I should be doing more to help the cause.</p>
<p class="p3">In no attempt to undermine calls for solidarity and unity, I want to emphasize that skipping a rally to go to work or just spending time with friends doesn’t make you any less of an activist. And by that same logic, chanting loudly at a protest just to make noise doesn’t make you the ultimate revolutionary. Progress looks different depending on who is making it.</p>

		<title>Esemplare ’18: Why S/NC is failing us</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/13/esemplare-18-snc-failing-us/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When applying to colleges, the thing I liked most about Brown was its promise of academic freedom. As I toiled through my final year of high school, I had grown weary of rigid course requirements. At a Brown information session that year, I was enthralled by the promise of an open curriculum. After being accepted, I prepared to fill my semesters with the pursuit of my own curiosities.</p>
<p class="p2">This vision, for the most part, has become reality. Brown’s academic freedom is unmatched among its peers, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>its influence on my college years is unmistakable. But when it comes to Brown’s promise of liberation from educational constraints, the S/NC option is at least as important, and considerably more famous, than the open curriculum. Brown’s allure to the average observer as a pioneer in academic freedom hinges on its near mythical “pass / fail” system, and I have had many friends and relatives make the all-too-common mistake of forgetting that Brown has grades at all. On campus, this option is so deeply ingrained in the University’s culture that we seldom question its influence or merit. When challenged by outsiders to defend it, we scoff at these misguided students of less enlighten<span class="s1">ed universities, who simply cannot grasp the richness and beauty of a true liberal arts education — of learning pursued for learning’s sake. </span></p>
<p class="p2">During my first semester on campus, I shared this perspective. I enrolled in a computer science class with the S/NC grading option, and everything was as it should be. I had taken a class outside of my major, with which I had no previous experience, without fear that such exploration would hurt my GPA, and I had learned a great deal that might otherwise have gone unlearned.</p>
<p class="p2">Yet the S/NC system does have flaws worth discussing. Of course, as soon as I heard about the S/NC grading option, I knew that people would take advantage of it for less noble academic reasons, such as to avoid a bad grade in a difficult class or simply as a workload reduction strategy. The existence of this type of misuse alone presents some reasonable objections to the system, but it is not my biggest qualm with it. The point of academic freedom, after all, is that students are responsible for their own education. This means that if Brown is committed to academic freedom, it will have to accept that students will not always utilize its academic system responsibly. You cannot give students the freedom to explore and challenge themselves without also giving them the freedom not to do so.</p>
<p class="p2">My most fundamental concern with the S/NC option is not with those that would abuse it, but rather with those who approach it with pure intentions. The concern is the result of another hallmark of a Brown education — namely, its rigor.</p>
<p class="p2">The reality of the workload at Brown and comparable universities is that students are not realistically expected to complete every assignment over the course of the year. I have frequently had teachers and classmates suggest that it would be impossible to read every book or article assigned in full, and that skimming and occasionally skipping these materials was the only way to survive the semester. The value of such a model could be the subject of its own article, but in relation to the S/NC option, this system of learning can quickly become problematic. As anyone who has taken a class S/NC will confess, there comes an inevitable point in every semester when the needs of classes being taken for a grade trump any high-minded idealism that existed at the semester’s start. Indeed, to focus on readings or homework assignments for an S/NC course in the middle of a hectic semester requires a level of discipline that is borderline irresponsible. As a student parcels out inadequate time and mental resources among courses, those taken S/NC are necessarily the first casualties.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, not all courses are easy to pass, and not all decisions are made with reverence for GPAs. Ultimately, I do feel that there will always be a role for the S/NC option at Brown, but I do believe the need to allow its unrestricted use is more imagined than real. Over the past three years, I have<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>found that, if I truly want to learn about a subject, I need to take it for a grade. I have come to believe that in education, as in all things, you sometimes need to throw yourself headfirst into something you are afraid of if you wish to grow. In Brown’s efforts to make students comfortable taking a risk, I fear they have simply made it less necessary to do so.</p>

		<title>Campanelli &#039;18: America deserves better than Confederate statues</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Anyone who knows me knows that I am a proud Virginian. I am a proud native to a small rural county just southeast of Charlottesville. On Aug. 12 I attended the counterprotest to the “Unite the Right” rally that brought hundreds of white nationalists to my home state. I witnessed firsthand the hate, bigotry and violence that the white nationalists inspired. A group of people commandeered and terrorized a city I call home. In the wake of the terrorist attack in Charlottesville and the mass violence and destruction of the city, many have advocated for the removal of the Confederate statues that these racists continue to defend, but others have stated that they remain an important part of U.S. history and should stay. President Trump has even weighed in, saying the taking down of Confederate statues is “so foolish,” and that “they’re trying to take away our culture.”</p>
<p class="p3">It is time for these Confederate statues to be removed and more accurately historicized. While people from all walks of life have weighed in on this topic, I think of my own personal experience as a kid who got swept up in the broader culture’s reverence for the Confederacy. In the 4th grade my class was required to do a research project on influential actors in the Civil War. I chose Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. During this project I became enthralled with the man who led a government that actively fought to tear apart the United States and preserve the institution of slavery. Like others around me, I justified his actions as “fighting for states’ rights” and “honorably standing alongside his southern brothers.” I respected his “honor,” “courage,” “leadership” and “conviction.” Even as my parents and my teacher told me that Jefferson Davis was not a hero, I stood by my Confederate idol.</p>
<p class="p3">My parents tried to persuade me otherwise, and they took me to Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia — a street that is lined with monuments ranging from Confederate leaders to the world-famous tennis player Arthur Ashe. But I only wanted to see one monument in particular, that of Jefferson Davis. I stood before the memorial in awe of the Confederate president who once governed the entire Southeast from Richmond. With his arm outstretched he looked into the distance appearing stately, justified and honorable. There was my hero, right in front of me, standing larger than life.</p>
<p class="p3">Later that year I went to a Civil War gift shop and wanted to purchase a Confederate hat and outfit. My mom looked down at me — grey fatigues in my hands — with disappointment. She would not let me purchase the Confederate outfit because she said they fought for the wrong cause. But I fought back. I suggested that they fought for states’ rights. They fought for their southern brothers. I went so far as to say that if I was alive during the Civil War, I would have fought for the South because I was a proud Southerner.</p>
<p class="p3">But as I began to grow up and study in depth the history of the Civil War, Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement, I gained exposure to history outside of my small rural county, and I began to see the Confederacy as the evil it really was. I now see Jefferson Davis as the terrible slaveholding rebel who fought against the United States and I detest the motivations of the Confederacy. But these memories confirm an ever-important truth. The hundreds of Confederate statues that line towns and cit<span class="s1">ies across the United States need to be removed from their pedestals. As kids, like my 4th grade self, stare up at them, they memorialize and honor a sickening element of American history. These monuments reinforce to people of all ages that the Confederacy was something honorable and prestigious. They instill this idea in children like me at a young age and make frank discussions about history and race difficult for young people. These statues perpetuate a false image of the Confederacy and propagate a culture in which Confederate leaders, and the causes they fought for, are not decried as evil and fundamentally un-American, but are rather referred to as stately and patriotic. We need to own this truth and begin the process of reversing it.</span></p>
<p class="p3">I am a proud Virginian and I am a proud Southerner, but these monuments must go. They are not accurate representations of history. They were built during the Jim Crow South as an act of defiance toward equality among races. They do not accurately recognize why these men fought for the Confederacy, that they fought to destroy the United States, or the terrible atrocities they committed against the slaves in the South. Taking these monuments down and moving them to a museum is not a destruction of, as Trump says, “our culture,” but an acknowledgement of the troubling history of the United States and a recognition of why these statues were actually erected.</p>
<p class="p3">If we want to move this nation forward, then it is time to abandon the myth of the “lost cause” and confront the bigotry, hatred and racism that were pervasive throughout our nation’s history and that sadly continue on in this moment. If we fail to address this issue now, more young children, like my younger self, will continue to think that Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee are worth idolizing. We will fail to truly and accurately acknowledge our nation’s past and fail to reconcile this history. Our inaction will perpetuate a cycle that does not accurately teach history, but distorts it — at the expense of younger generations. We must be honest with our history and with the culture of racism in this country. By moving these statues to museums, contextualizing their historical significance and owning up to the history of the Confederacy, we can start to better represent “our culture” for what it really was and currently is.</p>

		<title>Friedman &#039;19: The importance of time to oneself</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When I think back on my summer, some of my favorite moments were spent alone. Oddly enough, I really enjoyed my daily one-hour commute in Los Angeles traffic from the San Fernando Valley to Pasadena. My falsetto dramatically improved with all of the R&amp;B music that I sang along to in the car, and my knowledge of world events expanded as I listened to KCRW, L.A.’s local affiliate of National Public Radio, whenever I became tired of hearing my own voice. I attended a Dodgers game by myself after my date bailed on me and my grandfather decided he was too tired to attend ­­— even though, to add insult to injury, he was able to fly all the way to Chicago to attend a World Series game last fall. It turns out a solo baseball game is actually a very pleasant experience. There was no obligation on my part to entertain a friend, so I could pay full attention to the best team in baseball and enjoy my garlic fries without sharing.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But, despite the allure of the garlic fries, I have to say my favorite activity from the summer was single sculling in Marina Del Rey at 6 a.m. every Tuesday and Thursday. As an 18-month member of the Brown crew team, I usually don’t get the luxury of training and rowing by myself — most collegiate programs exclusively row eight-person boats — but the summer afforded me the opportunity to take my rowing schedule into my own hands and occasionally stop to enjoy the sunrise, a luxury which I am almost never afforded during practices on the Seekonk River.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">By contrast, the predominant sentiment on college campuses stigmatizes the act of voluntarily spending one’s time alone. Perhaps due to the emphasis on socializing, parties and participating in extracurriculars, students are generally wary of doing anything alone or presenting an image of social isolation. Or perhaps college students are affected by — and contribute to — the larger societal “mistrust of solitude”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that is often attributed to the rise of smartphones, which is making us into a more group-oriented society. In fact, in a recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Virginia, a quarter of surveyed women and two-thirds of surveyed men “chose to subject themselves to electric shock rather than be alone with their thoughts.” Granted, I see plenty of people studying alone at coffee shops and libraries; this is well-established student behavior, but sometimes I become self-conscious of my own social life when I find myself eating alone in the Ratty. Is eating alone — or, for that matter, exploring Providence alone, attending sporting events alone or just being alone — considered a problem? If it is, it shouldn’t be.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There are, in fact, established therapeutic benefits to spending time alone. Although their advantages have not been formally quantified, moments of social isolation can help people “out-maneuver some of the toxicity that surrounds them in a social setting,” according to California State Polytechnic University at Pomona Associate Professor of Sociology Jack Fong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This insight extends the previous “surrender and catch” theory put forth by sociologist Kurt Wolff in 1984 that suggests that time alone can allow a person to embrace a worldview of epistemological relativism — in simpler terms, the idea that knowledge is relative to time, place, society and culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whether epistemological relativism is the correct approach to knowledge remains up for debate, but this idea of valuing social isolation is embraced by scholars outside of sociology as well; indeed, one of the preeminent American novelists of our time, Jonathan Franzen, even published a series of essays called “How to Be Alone” in 2003.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On an even deeper level, isolation allows us to practice introspection. Introspection in turn allows us to create an identity that is built on something internal rather than the external identity-markers, brands and group associations on which we increasingly rely. In an era when our personal brands broadcasted via Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Pinterest and other platforms are dominating our personal lives, it is worth considering the authenticity of one’s own brand — and what better way to do that than to reserve a few minutes of each day for oneself?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I can’t say that through my time alone this summer, I have teased out the fine nuances of my own interests and identity. I can’t even say that I chose to spend time alone voluntarily — most of the time, I was simply left high and dry by others. But I ended up enjoying it. I can safely say that my time alone has allowed me to feel substantially more comfortable with myself in the context of my generation and society at large. I knew with complete certainty that when I took out my single rowing shell into Marina Del Rey at 6 a.m., I truly wanted to be there. That feeling of solitude is worth more than many of us think.</span></p>

		<title>Mitra &#039;18: Stop reading college rankings</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Over the years, people have attributed the economic inequality in higher education to a variety of conditions: the advantage given to legacy students, the lack of extensive and well-communicated financial aid opportunities and the altogether inscrutable college admissions process. Now, a new factor has been thrown into the mix: the college ranking system.</p>
<p class="p2">University rankings have long been criticized for being opaque, inaccurate and reductive. But these lists — particularly the recently released U.S. News and World Report College Rankings — have far greater implications for the higher education landscape than simply misleading high school seniors. According to a new report from <a href="http://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/top-college-rankings-list-2017-us-news-investigation/">Politico</a>, the criteria used in the U.S. News’ ranking decisions can directly feed into systems of economic inequality on campuses, creating perverse incentives for colleges to favor wealthier students.</p>
<p class="p2">Don’t believe me? Well, let’s look at the various factors taken into consideration by the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings">U.S. News rankings formula</a>. They include low acceptance rates, which can incentivize colleges to favor early decision applicants over low-income applicants who tend to apply later; students’ performance on standardized tests, which correlates with family income; and financial resources and alumni giving, which can result in colleges accepting more legacy applicants to ensure their parents will continue donating. All of these focus areas implicitly favor students from wealthier backgrounds. And this doesn’t even account for the most egregious criterion of all: reviews from high school guidance counselors at high-performing (and often elite) schools, which somehow determine <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/high-school-counselor-rankings-methodology">7.5 percent of the ranking</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Meanwhile other critical factors are left out of the equation. Financial aid opportunities, student satisfaction levels and well-being indicators, to list a few obvious points of interest, were not included. What about economic diversity, socioeconomic mobility, health and counseling services, responsiveness to assault and misconduct allegations, housing conditions, the diversity of the faculty and student body or students’ living costs? As you can imagine, none of these criteria are directly factored into the U.S. News rankings — or any other popular set of rankings, for that matter.</p>
<p class="p2">It would be easy to argue that these aspects of a college education are difficult to quantify, and in some cases that is fair. But, as researchers from the Equality of Opportunity Project (including Brown’s own Associate Professor of Economics and International and Public Affairs John N. Friedman) have already <a href="http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/">shown</a>, economic diversity and mobility at different schools can and have been compared. There is no excuse for not integrating these types of data into college rankings, especially not in an era when debates about education are driven by notions of equity.</p>
<p class="p2">Yet, despite the sizable gaps in the methodology used by the U.S. News, its metrics still have an enormous impact on the strategic decisions of college administrations. Politico reached out to over 20 former and current education officials and members of university leadership and found that the vast majority attributed the lack of economic diversity on campuses, at least in part, to the U.S. News rankings. Carol Christ, chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, told Politico that the annual listing has a “mind-boggling” effect on administrative decisions. F. King Alexander, president of Louisiana State University, went even further: “I think U.S. News has done more damage to the higher education marketplace than any single enterprise that’s out there.”</p>
<p class="p2">That’s a lot to place on one ranking measure, and we should take this with a grain of salt. But it should still be alarming that so many stakeholders involved in higher education take issue with the U.S. News system. So what can we do about it?</p>
<p class="p2">Well, for a start, colleges need to stop manipulating the ranking system at the cost of student diversity and inclusion. Admittedly, that is easier said than done, since the prestige that comes with a high rank often leads to more funding opportunities, applicants, faculty prospects and research capabilities. Still, elite universities — and particularly the Ivy League institutions — have some leverage to cast the rankings aside and find their own way forward; the top 20 institutions remain largely the same year over year, and the difference of a few ranks in one direction or the other is unlikely to make a significant difference. Instead of worrying about whether they rank 14th or 18th on the U.S. News list, college administrations should publicly acknowledge that these composite ranking systems are inherently flawed and move away from the rat race.</p>
<p class="p2">At the same time, analysts must develop more comprehensive and equitable metrics to assess the quality of universities. The College Scorecard <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">website</a>, created by President Obama’s Department of Education, and the Equality of Opportunity Project’s mobility report cards are a step in the right direction, but campuses need to do a better job communicating and reacting to these measurements.</p>
<p class="p2">As for students — high school and college students alike — there is a simple solution: Stop reading the U.S. News rankings. Base your decisions on curricula, campus environments, facilities, professors and, yes, any data you can find on campus inequality. These are all better measures than a system that has been described as “the greatest inefficiency ranking in America.”</p>

		<title>Maden &#039;18: S/NC is a tool for self-care and equity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The S/NC grading option is a cornerstone of Brown’s academic experience. It provides students with the freedom to try courses without worrying about letter grades or GPAs. However, the value of the S/NC option often comes under debate. Most recently, a column printed in The Herald, written by Nicholas Esemplare ’18, raised criticism on this very issue. Esemplare writes that, without grades, there’s no incentive to invest in the course material, so students in S/NC courses tend to put less effort into those classes.</p>
<p class="p2">Clearly, S/NC isn’t for everyone. That’s fine. Taking courses for a grade, as opposed to S/NC, is part of the academic agency we get here. But that doesn’t mean S/NC, as a rule, fails Brown students. Esemplare’s article contains a key contradiction that made me reflect on the way people perceive the S/NC option and how negative perceptions of S/NC are what actually fail us.</p>
<p class="p2">Esemplare states that students shouldn’t use S/NC to reduce their workload, but also believes that it’s wrong for students to do all of the work in an S/NC course. In one instance, Esemplare writes that people often use the S/NC option for “less noble academic reasons” like “reducing their course load.” At this point, Esemplare seems to believe that students should try as hard to earn an “S” as they do to earn an “A.” But then Esemplare writes that it’s “borderline irresponsible” to focus on an S/NC course over a graded course. To Esemplare, there is seemingly no good reason to take a class S/NC. If it’s wrong to use the S/NC option to make your semester easier and you can’t use it to challenge yourself, what is it for?</p>
<p class="p2">In reality, Esemplare may have omitted from his article some important benefits of the S/NC option, such as the freedom it provides. Full disclosure: I take all of my classes S/NC. Crazy, right? S/NC helps me because I’m a low-income student, and it’s likely helping other first-generation and low-income students for similar reasons. There’s no need to conflate personal preference with institutional failure. Doing so just makes navigating Brown more confusing, especially for students already unfamiliar with its culture.</p>
<p class="p2">While I can only speak for my own experience as a student from a low-income background, the reality is that articles like Esemplare’s perpetuate the idea that S/NC is inferior, which makes it harder for FLI students to navigate course options. It’s important to recognize that other people have unique approaches to their academics and that for some students — especially FLI students — S/NC courses can be great. I use the S/NC option firstly because I don’t feel confident in most of my courses but still want to challenge myself. Secondly, taking courses S/NC also gives me flexibility to support my family during the semester. Thirdly, it reduces the stress associated with traditional grading and helps me manage my mental health. These factors are tied to my identity as a FLI student. I feel less confident with course selection because I’m a FLI student, I need flexibility because I’m a FLI student and I struggle with poor mental health because I’m a FLI student.</p>
<p class="p2">You might decide grades are important to you (law school, anyone?). But there isn’t a “right” way to take classes at Brown, despite what the S/NC stigma may suggest. FLI students, in particular, may have alternative mindsets or approaches to course selection. We have to work hard to recognize this and validate these views. That said, there isn’t a problem with disliking S/NC courses or deciding that they don’t suit you. The problem is conflating a personal preference for graded courses with a systemic issue. A systemic issue suggests that there’s something inherently wrong with taking S/NC classes, which creates a culture where grades become the priority. Instead, we should discuss what drives one’s personal preference and prioritize introspection.</p>
<p class="p2">In practice, that means providing advice on course selection that emphasizes self-reflection and self-care. When discussing course options, we too often hold preconceptions about what is the right and wrong way to approach academics at Brown. So before we give rash advice, we should ask questions that prompt reflection. Will this class make you happy? What do you want to get out of this course? What other commitments does this course intersect with? The answers are different for everyone, so it’s important not to stigmatize certain academic options.</p>
<p class="p2">When I take a course, my number one concern is how it’s going to help me graduate and provide for the people I care about. Will I develop a marketable skill set? Will it help me complete my concentration requirements so I can actually get my degree? Will it be an easy class so that I can put more effort into other courses more relevant to my career goals? The S/NC option can help with all of these things, and it has helped me many times. But it hurts when people with different academic goals don’t recognize that my goals are, in fact, different — or think that I don’t have, as Esemplare states, “noble” reasons for clawing through four years of classes. It hurts because the stigma associated with S/NC classes makes me feel like I shouldn’t take courses S/NC at all. It took a lot of introspection to realize what I want out of my time here at Brown, and it took a lot of introspection to be comfortable leveraging the S/NC option in ways that work best for me. It hurts that the cultural stigma around the S/NC option makes this work feel worthless.</p>
<p class="p2">Dismissing S/NC courses as something tangential to a “real” and “proper” academic experience makes it harder for me — and probably other FLI students — to feel comfortable at Brown. For some, S/NC courses are a great choice. For others, maybe not. But either way, self-reflection and self-care should come first. Students should be able to use the S/NC option in the way that works best for them without having to feel bad about it.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On June 15, Jay-Z became the first rapper inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the induction ceremony, former President Barack Obama recorded a video tribute as an introduction to Jay-Z’s acceptance speech. During the tribute, Obama said,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So, I’m pretty sure I’m still the only president (that listened) to Jay Z’s music in the Oval Office.” Obama went on to compare himself to the rapper, joking about how both of their wives are “significantly more popular” than they are and how “nobody who met (them) as younger men would have expected (them) to be where (they) are today.” Given their longstanding friendship, it is no coincidence that Jay-Z dropped his new album, “4:44,” at the height of the political unrest unsettling the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For a start, “4:44” phonetically reads as “for 44,” leading many to believe that it was in homage to the 44th president. This seems especially convincing given the timing of the album’s release: It dropped just as Obama’s successor was actively working to dismantle his eight-year legacy and jettison the core values and norms that have historically embodied the presidency. With lyrics such as, “Y’all stuck in La La Land/Even when we win we gon’ lose,” which blatantly point to broader cultural debates, it is clear that Jay-Z wanted to make an overt political statement — and he is not alone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the last year, songs by black artists such as Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole and Beyoncé offer resistance to the racism that is spreading across the country. Their lyrics focus on black liberation, colorism, financial stability and broader ideas that impact communities of color — and indeed, Brown students (pun intended). Songs like “Alright,” “How much a dolla’ cost,” “Kill Jay-Z,” “Freedom” and countless others act as a mouthpiece for black America, especially during these uncertain times under the Trump administration. These prominent artists are using their platforms politically, and it has proven to be a powerful way to start conversations about social equity and civil rights. With stark language and confrontational delivery, their music transcends the careful and diplomatic molds in which politicians are expected to act. In a spectrum defined by cautiously political conversations on the one side, and passionate emotions and lived experiences on the other, this music offers a raw, unfiltered alternative that reaches a different audience.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For example, contrast Obama’s farewell speech with recent music from any one of these artists. As president, Obama’s speech was addressed to the American people as a whole. He aimed to highlight the importance of every occupation, gender and citizenship status by acknowledging that “democracy won’t work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity.” This idea is well-liked among listeners from across the political spectrum — but it doesn’t get to the heart of the overlooked systems of oppression halting social and economic mobility for minorities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After all, if your great-great-grandmother was lynched for attempting to read, earning a high school diploma might as well be the Congressional Medal of Honor. If your neighborhood is plagued with all of the county’s incinerators and landfills, it’s easy for environmental disparities — contaminated water or poor air quality — to stunt the growth of youth and impact standards of living. More often than not, these situations and others like it disproportionately affect black and brown bodies to the extent that political cliches such as “economic opportunity” for everyone don’t seem very equitable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And it is at this point that black artists’ rhythmic phrases claim their power. Instead of speaking to the country as a whole, artists are able to tailor their lyrics to certain groups. Artists such as Kendrick and Beyoncé are able to speak to an assortment of groups because they belong to multiple identities — black, male or female, single or married, southern or from other regions in America. Their art is important because it’s usually more digestible than political speeches. They can also shed light on microaggressions and racial injustices without having to hide behind carefully-chosen platitudes. They can make music about issues facing their communities with unapologetic lyrics that influence their fans. That isn’t to say that everything associated with these artists has to be about blackness, rather their ability to make art about whatever they want and black issues is a step in the right direction for the entire community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Artists — and frankly, all public figures — are leading acts of resistance through their platforms in a way that politicians cannot. There is an ever-moving line between art and activism, where beats and politics cannot be separated. For walking this line, the work of black artists to start these conversations should be recognized, celebrated and supported.</span></p>

		<title>Kim ’19: We need Asian American representation in Hollywood</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/19/kim-19-need-asian-american-representation-hollywood/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In recent years, Hollywood has been pushing for equal representation for all genders, sexualities and ethnicities on-screen. While Hollywood is making progress on these issues, there is clearly more to be made, especially for the Asian American community. Only in the past three years or so have Asian Americans seen an uptick in leading roles. Television comedies such as “Master of None,” starring Aziz Ansari, “Fresh Off the Boat,” starring Randall Park and Constance Wu, and “Dr. Ken,” starring Ken Jeong, have done well with audiences. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now, we may be witnessing that success expanding to feature films. Currently playing in select theaters, “Gook” is a film about two Korean American brothers — Eli, played by Justin Chon, and Daniel, played by David So — and their unlikely relationship with an 11-year-old African American girl, Kamilla, played by Simone Baker. The film follows them in Los Angeles during the first days of the infamous Rodney King riots in 1992. The film won this year’s Sundance NEXT Audience Award — an award whose winner is voted for by the viewers, rather than chosen by critics. "Gook" is the directorial debut of Chon, who also wrote and directed the film.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Throughout the film, we see billowing pillars of black smoke against a muddy-white sky — the film is shot in black and white, and importantly so, as "Gook" explores the tense relationship between Korean Americans and African Americans during this riotous period. The term “gook” itself is a derogatory one given to Koreans by Americans. In Korean, “mi gook” means American, so people mistakenly assumed that’s what Koreans called themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the ’90s, Los Angeles was segregated, with African Americans populating impoverished areas. At the same time, Korean Americans immigrating to the United States had very little money. Often, they took up residence in these cheaper areas and started small businesses of their own. African Americans felt threatened, and as “Gook” shows, would steal from and vandalize stores owned by Korean Americans. This in turn incited violence from Korean Americans to stop such acts. Ultimately, both groups gave in to unpropitious stereotypes, contributing to enduring tensions. Eventually, these businesses brought money into the poorer neighborhoods, which are now thriving economically. These relations in Los Angeles, where Chon grew up and to which he clearly has personal ties, are still improving.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Gook” explains and explores these relationships well. Every character gets their turn in the spotlight, and nearly all roles are played by people of color — the only notable white actor in the film, ironically, plays a doctor. As the depiction of the riots brings the film to its climax,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>viewers enjoy a payoff that taps into our rawest and most fundamental human emotions —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>fear and love.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s a fine debut for the 36-year-old Chon and a relevant one considering the political landscape today. It’s a film people should watch. Support for “Gook” should be and deserves to be stronger. Asian Americans have long been out of the spotlight in media. We have long been labeled as timid and shy, but as “Gook” shows, Asian American presence in Hollywood is steadily growing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just a month ago, actor Ed Skrein, who’s white, announced he was leaving his major role in the upcoming reboot of “Hellboy,” because he was unaware the original character in the comics is of Asian <a href="http://variety.com/2017/film/news/ed-skrein-exits-hellboy-whitewashing-1202540677/">descent</a>. The show recently cast Korean American actor Daniel Dae Kim to replace him, demonstrating that it really isn’t too hard to cast appropriately. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Whitewashing” has become a term thrown around almost nonchalantly. Even during the 2015 Academy Awards “Oscars So White” controversy, all the focus was directed on African Americans, with the Asian and Latinx community receiving little support or recognition. Though it was called “Oscars So White,” America treated it as “Oscars Not Black,” with Asians being the butt of a cheap, stereotypical <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/16/oscars-academy-apology-racist-asian-stereotypes-chris-rock">joke</a> from host Chris Rock. In other words, we’re still getting there.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What Justin Chon did in “Gook” is rare in Hollywood. He created a strong story in a timely setting, and we should be paying more attention to it. Hopefully, it inspires others to follow his lead. As my 15-year-old brother put it: “It was nice to see an Asian American guy as the lead in a film. I haven’t seen that in a long time. Like, ever.”</span></p>

		<title>Cordoso &#039;19: Beyond College Hill and &quot;Crimetown&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This summer, a few friends and I decided to drive into Providence, Rhode Island to grab dinner. Our destination was a small, unassuming Mediterranean grill, somewhat out of place among the dozen-plus Italian restaurants on Federal Hill. The food was good, but we weren’t there for that. The place was comfortable, too, and the owners were genial, but we weren’t there for that either. The real reason my friends and I decided to drive into Providence to eat at an anonymous Mediterranean restaurant on Federal Hill? The restaurant is located at the former headquarters of the New England mafia — the third largest Cosa Nostra in the country at the height of its power.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This particular aspect of Providence’s history is not well-known to Brown students, the vast majority of whom are not from Rhode Island. The state also has its own incentives to avoid emphasizing its history with organized crime. Yet the surprising popularity of the recent true crime podcast "Crimetown" might change that. Listeners will no doubt have an intimate familiarity with the antics of Providence’s former six-time mayor and Shakespearean tragicomic anti-hero Vincent “Buddy” Cianci. They will know about Raymond Patriarca and the Patriarca crime family, as well as the remarkably humanized personal lives of various “wise guy” enforcers who struggled with everything from muckraking attorney general nuns to wolf-slaying Drug Enforcement Agency officers. Most of all, listeners will know of Federal Hill, the other half of the city, as the heart of the mythical Providence crafted by the writers. But while "Crimetown" is a remarkable achievement in storytelling, it obfuscates the true conditions of a city that is already very poorly understood by Brown students. If we take such a rich caricature of the city at face value, we overlook the complexities of Providence’s history and might feel less inclined to engage with its community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We often tell each other naïvely, patronizingly, but with good intentions, to get out of the “Brown bubble” and to adventure beyond the East Side to get a fuller understanding of the city. This is, fundamentally, good advice. As privileged students at an elite university, it is in part our responsibility to engage constructively with the community and, at the very least, make a good faith effort to appreciate it. But this advice is little more than a platitude. Often, whatever exploration we undertake unfolds within a framework of privileged observation rather than constructive community engagement. Generally, even if our perception of Providence includes more than just College Hill, it is colored by our consumption of media like "Crimetown" or brief and infrequent forays downtown and beyond.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">None of this is to say that there are not students who engage with the community. Despite recent criticism, the Swearer Center for Public Service facilitates responsible community engagement between Brown students and various local groups. But often, even this exposure is either superficial or tokenized. There is no shortage of community groups criticizing Brown students for their lack of dedication to community service or for their cavalier attitude toward the groups they are meant to serve. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Ultimately, the availability of programs that facilitate community engagement is not enough to ensure that Brown students become active and responsible members of the Providence community. Culturally, we are too content embracing the East Side as the beginning and end of the city, too uninterested in thinking critically about the mythology of Providence constructed by media such as "Crimetown" and too unwilling to actively learn about the community ourselves. There is a responsibility among administrators, faculty and students alike to cultivate a mentality in which we see ourselves not as transient occupants of an ivory tower, extracting what resources and connections we can before we move on, but as active members of a broader community — one wherein we might not vote or volunteer, but at the very least try to appreciate more than just College Hill.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">There is a line in "Crimetown" that is so topical that it bears repeating in full: “Providence is essentially two hills, on either side of a river. On one side is Federal Hill, Patriarca’s domain. On the other bank is the East Side, where Brown University is, where the doctors and lawyers and professionals live.” This is probably not meant to be a subtle polemic against the privilege of Brown students living in a city with a rich and complex history, but the very fact that the city was characterized this way suggests to me that there is progress to be made.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recalling first-year orientation brings back little besides the sensation of immense loneliness. Watching as my peers made fast friends with each other, feeling like an outsider observing social rituals conducted in a foreign tongue. I didn’t connect to anyone that first week at Brown, or the second. As my first semester slogged on and I still had trouble “connecting with the community of (my) peers and the larger campus and local communities” — one of the explicit goals of Brown’s <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/orientation/">orientation</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— I felt as though I had failed. I wasn’t a Brown student, just some imposter hiding out in the first-year complex called Keeney Quad. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No one told me that the process of orienting yourself to the Brown life doesn’t end with orientation. Orientation provides a crash course introduction to all things Brown: the campus, the classes, the traditions. But no matter how carefully planned, a few days of introduction will never be enough to ease the paths of many first-years.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To be sure, there are students who arrive to Brown’s campus and immediately thrive. Traditions like the new student ice cream social and the annual orientation dance wouldn’t be such mainstays if no one enjoyed them. The Orientation Welcoming Committee works hard to facilitate activities that leave a lasting impact on first-year students.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These experiences, while valid, are not representative of what all students go through. A number of recent posts on a Facebook page where Brown students anonymously submit crushes and confessions offers a look into how many first-years finish orientation without finding a sense of belonging. One begins by asking, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brownbearsadmirers/posts/1954589441448453">“Can someone please tell me when I’m supposed to start liking Brown?”</a> Another first-year admits, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brownbearsadmirers/posts/1954587284782002">“I don’t even feel like I’m happy to be here.” </a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It would be easy to dismiss posts like these as outliers, or to call students who feel disconnected from the campus overdramatic or impatient. After all, it’s been less than a month since school began. Of course not everyone can find their place in such a short amount of time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But in a recent article <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/opinion/sunday/college-freshman-mental-health.html?mcubz=1">titled</a>, “The Real Campus Scourge,” New York Times op-ed writer Frank Bruni points to the immense consequences of loneliness among new college students. Bruni argues that the sense of not belonging “can be a gateway to binge drinking and other self-destructive behavior.” He suggests that students who feel out of place are more likely to end up dropping out.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Bruni points to “extended, elaborate freshmen orientation schedules” as being “another intended prophylactic against loneliness.” And yes, the more orientation options are offered to students, the more likely it is that they’ll find friend groups with whom they belong. Events like yoga or the annual LGBTQ welcome dinner offer students the chance to connect with others in a smaller setting, one less chaotic than the new student ice cream social or the post-convocation barbeque.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For an introverted student like myself, I’m not sure that there are any events the Orientation Welcoming Committee could have planned that would have made it easier to adapt to my overwhelming new life at Brown. Adjusting to campus will always be harder for some folks than it is for others. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What’s needed to combat student loneliness isn’t a more extensive orientation, but rather a disclaimer given during mandatory events, like unit meetings or panels: You may not immediately find your place at Brown. You may not make friends right away. It’s not wrong to feel like you don’t belong, or to reach out to resources like Counseling and Psychological Services.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We need to make it explicitly clear to first-years that the students who come to Brown and immediately feel a sense of belonging are the lucky ones, not the norm. Perhaps they came to A Day On College Hill when they were first accepted and formed lasting friendships there; perhaps they networked in their class’s Facebook groups and arrived ready to bring virtual friendships to life. For all of those students who come in to an instant sense of community, there are those students — of which I am one ­­— who still sometimes struggle to feel like they have a place here. There are seniors who graduate feeling ambivalent about their time at Brown, unsure if they ever belonged.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Orientation isn’t a week-long process, but rather a journey to belonging that takes days for some and years for others. When we acknowledge that becoming part of Brown’s campus is a process without a time limit, perhaps we can begin having conversations about loneliness that aren’t limited to anonymous online forums.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Joel Stein and Nancy Gibbs. Gene Roberts. Anderson Cooper. The team from Spotlight. When I think of journalists who inspire me, these are the men and women who immediately come to mind. It is saddening that, off the top of my head, I can’t think of a single print journalist or columnist of color. For my birthday a few years back, my aunt and uncle gave me a copy of “The Race Beat,” a Pulitzer Prize-winning chronicle of black journalists who risked everything to publish news about the Civil Rights era. I didn’t recognize a single one.</p>
<p class="p3">This is symptomatic of the industry as a whole. According to the Atlantic, minority groups make up less than 14 percent of journalists at daily newspapers <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/minorities-in-journalism/399461/">nationwide</a>. This figure doesn’t represent a single minority group; it represents all of them. The statistic is pitiful — but, honestly, not surprising. The media industry, like other historically white fields (including government and medicine, to name two), thrives on unpaid internships and connections that a lot of underrepresented and low-income journalists simply do not have. Freelancing, career sabbaticals and living in our parents’ garages sometimes are not options. The assumption that writing will carry one’s career is rooted in privilege because good writing requires experience and often generates a smaller payout than other jobs, disadvantaging lower socioeconomic groups. Even studying journalism in schools can be daunting: When I shopped ENGL 1050H: “Journalistic Writing” and was told I’d have to find my own transportation across the city for interviews, not to mention allot more than 15 hours a week for one mandatory S/NC class, I balked. Nevertheless, English and modern culture and media concentrators try to do it anyway, and I applaud the bravery and dedication of those who have managed to stay in these departments. In the last decade, two-thirds of white graduates in journalism and communications found jobs out of college. Less than half of minority journalism graduates could say the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/minorities-in-journalism/399461/">same</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">This lack of representation permeates written word and is a real issue for all kinds of journalism. We end up with tone-deaf articles like the infamous New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/reader-center/our-readers-call-us-out-over-bubble-tea-they-are-right.html">piece</a> this summer that called boba, or bubble tea, “exotic,” “a new trend” and “so 2002.” Never mind that the drink exists all over Asian street corners and major American urban hubs. It’s the reason why crime headlines often feature mug shots of black and Latino men, but then post nice, professional class photos of white suspects (I’m looking at you, Brock Turner). These are not isolated incidents — they are consequences of an institutionalized system (one from which, if I may say, The Herald is not exempt).</p>
<p class="p3">I can’t help but compare this trend to the broader decline of print media over the last few years. BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post are taking up a greater market share of digital readers, and they represent an increasingly diverse public group. These organizations succeed (and are often scoffed at by the establishment) because they operate more on submissions, have wider pipelines for authors and democratize the writing process out of the hands of mostly old white men. Anyone can contribute to these sites; indeed, the articles that seem to thrive on these platforms often talk about taboo issues that other sources do not cover. There are issues with quality and accountability, of course, but these sites<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>legitimize themselves because they have the ability to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p class="p3">Nevertheless, there is still a need to supplement these online resources with diverse viewpoints in ink and paper. Who would have thought that one of the most progressive media organizations to come out of this decade would be Teen Vogue? Young people are still reading print, and research shows that this form of media is more engaging than its online <a href="http://wainscotmedia.com/blog/young-people-still-read-print-magazines">counterpart</a>. In a world full of iPhones and PDFs, humans still find more legitimacy in paper and ink. Blogs and tumblrs might popularize ideas, but the written word physically cements these concepts for posterity. Print still holds a valuable place in our society.</p>
<p class="p3">As Brown doubles down on its commitment to diversity and inclusivity, the print organizations that represent it should do the same. They have a responsibility to present a diverse range of voices and recognize the structural barriers that impede that goal. At The Herald, the organization is working toward <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/21/toward-better-herald/">this</a>, though there is still enormous room for improvement. But that improvement cannot materialize without help to shed light on stories that matter and have been brushed under the rug. So don’t take the tongue-in-cheek advice of Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who visited the University on Tuesday and discouraged others from exploring the field of journalism. If you have even a smidgen of interest in the many topics that this organization and others fail to cover and feel comfortable with sharing your ideas, try writing about them. The Herald, to take just one example, prints enough daily copies of the newspaper to build a paper-mache house and then some. Readership is practically guaranteed. And for better or for worse, it is a direct pipeline to alums, administrators and the institutional record of the University.</p>
<p class="p3">I speak from my own experience. When The Herald published racist and hurtful pieces in my freshman year, I decided to join the team because I believed that fixing white journalism began with me. You can do the same. You don’t have to consider yourself a career journalist (I sure don’t). Heck, if you want, you can even take my bi-monthly spot on this page. I’m just counting on you to make your words count.</p>

		<title>Colby ’20: No-loans doesn’t go far enough</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">President Christina Paxson P ’19 announced Wednesday that the University will launch a $120 million campaign to remove all loans from financial aid packages for all undergraduates and replace them with grants.</p>
<p class="p3">This effort displays an important commitment to improving socioeconomic diversity on campus. But while the move is laudable and will help many students, it does little to address the major drivers of entrenched socioeconomic inequality on campus. Cost is a major determinant of educational access, but the regressive policies within the admissions office perpetuate inequality, dictating who is admitted to the University in the first place.</p>
<p class="p3">It is no secret that Brown’s student population severely overrepresents the richest Americans. Over 19 percent of Brown students come from the top 1 percent of the income scale, while 18.2 percent come from the bottom 60 percent of the income <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html?mcubz=0">scale</a>. Moreover, 70 percent of all Brown students come from families in the top 20 percent median family income bracket. This inequality is deeply ingrained in Brown as an institution, and while the University’s new financial aid initiative attempts to alleviate the problem, it doesn’t get at the root cause.</p>
<p class="p3">In 2003, the University unveiled its need-blind admissions policy, promising to make a Brown education more accessible to students from all income backgrounds. Eliminating all loans in undergraduate financial aid packages awarded by the University is the next major step in fulfilling this promise. Quite frankly, however, this initiative will do little to alter the skewed economic makeup of the Brown student body. Peer institutions that have implemented similar loan-free financial aid programs continue to struggle with economic diversity on their campuses. Yale, Penn and Princeton all have loan-free aid programs, but the number of students from the top 1 percent still outnumber those from the entire bottom 60 percent. Financial aid programs simply do not affect the student body as much as the admissions protocols that decide who is receives an acceptance letter.</p>
<p class="p3">If<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the University is serious about improving socioeconomic diversity on campus, it must also reform the admissions processes that determine the composition of the student body. The admission office maintains antiquated policies that benefit the rich. Standardized testing, legacy admission and preferences for costly extracurriculars all preserve the very inequality the administration is trying to prevent.</p>
<p class="p3">Brown’s reliance upon and use of standardized tests like the SAT and ACT disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Students from the highest income bracket generally outperform the poorest by 400 points on the SAT. This achievement gap is created by a confluence of factors, the largest being test preparation tutoring. Families dole out thousands of dollars to test prep companies in the hopes of improving their children’s standardized test scores, but these materials remain out of reach for most low-income applicants. Similarly, these standardized tests cost significant amounts of money to take and re-take, and subsidies for such costs are limited in <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/fees/fee-waivers">quantity</a>. Many have also argued that the language used on these tests benefits students from families who are wealthy and speak English as a native language. In 2003, controversy erupted when an SAT question centered on the word “regatta” — a series of boat or yacht races — which many protested was a word only privileged, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/27/local/me-sat27">coastal</a> Americans would know. Despite all this, Brown relies heavily on these tests, requiring students to take extra “SAT Subject Tests” imposes even more burdensome <a href="https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/what-standardized-tests-do-you-require">costs</a> .</p>
<p class="p3">The most explicitly regressive policy that promotes inequality and the admission of the wealthiest is legacy admission. As Herald columnist Lena Renshaw ’20 recently wrote, “The University cannot meaningfully offer more opportunities to underrepresented students so long as it clings to legacy admissions, one of the prime <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/17/renshaw-20-end-legacy-admissions-brown/">engines</a> of inequality.” If Brown wanted to rethink its admissions policy — which effectively reserves between 10 and 12 percent of each year’s seats for the children of alums — it could very easily expand the proportion of low-income students on campus.</p>
<p class="p3">And ending legacy admissions doesn’t have to come at the expense of the University’s finances. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has proven the positive impacts of ending legacy admissions; MIT performs far better than all Ivy League schools in terms of socioeconomic diversity, with 23.4 percents of students coming from the bottom 60 percent of the income scale and only 5.7 percent coming from the top 1 percent — all while maintaining a substantial endowment.</p>
<p class="p3">What is perhaps the largest driver of socioeconomic inequality at Brown is the skewed way in which the University treats the qualifications of students from higher income brackets. By focusing on students from elite feeder private schools like Brearley and Trinity schools in New York, which both send over 40 percent of their graduates to the Ivy Leagues — a phenomenon I’ve written about before<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— the University’s admissions officers undermine their own ability to build socioeconomically diverse classes. Further, overvaluing expensive and exclusive extracurriculars — sports like horseback riding and ice hockey, as well as academic competitions like travel debate — stacks the cards against students from families and school districts that lack vast resources.</p>
<p class="p3">The end result of these subtle practices in college admissions — the continued use of standardizing testing, preferences for legacy applicants and preferences for certain extracurriculars — is subconscious discrimination against low-income students. Ultimately, it is fantastic that the University’s administration realizes that socioeconomic inequality on campus is a problem worth tackling, and the elimination of all loans in undergraduate financial aid awards is truly admirable. But they must also address the University’s socioeconomic diversity in realms other than financial aid to truly have an impact.</p>

		<title>Savello &#039;18: Coming home to Brown</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I returned back to campus this semester after studying abroad, I felt like I was entering a second freshman year. Thayer Street had completely transformed, the dining halls had changed and everywhere I looked, the unfamiliar faces of new students replaced those of the upperclassmen who had long graduated. I felt lost and out of place, not to mention shell-shocked by the workload and responsibilities I had once been so used to. To say it was a difficult adjustment would be an understatement. But my experience was not unique: many students face similar challenges re-adapting to life at Brown after a semester abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some of these obstacles — particularly social and academic ones — are unavoidable, as they come with the territory of shifting between countries and schools. But others can certainly be reduced, especially when the impediments are purely logistical. Take issues with student housing after going abroad in the fall, for example, or the lengthy period of transcript processing. These are small-scale but time-consuming burdens that can exacerbate the difficult adjustment. Another problem is the automatic meal plan cancellation after study abroad, which forces students to visit the Dining Services office in person to reverse the cancellation when they arrive back on campus. This may also seem like a minor inconvenience, but it has larger implications: It means that, if students study abroad in the spring, the financial aid they calculate for the following year will not include the costs of their meal plans. Procedural issues like these are far too common, and can create unnecessary financial and academic pressures for returning students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After years of sending students abroad, shouldn’t Brown be more prepared to deal with these issues in an efficient manner? Students have enough trouble re-adapting to Brown’s course load and combatting culture shock after they come back from a study abroad program, so why give them more to worry about?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Instead of addressing this issue, the Office of International Programs focuses its energy on convincing students to go abroad — sometimes even for a second time. When I browsed through the “Returning Students” page on the OIP’s website for more information, I was struck by the fact that it states, “you could be traveling again before you know it.” By contrast, not a lot of information was offered about re-adjusting back to Brown and the United States. While I understand that the OIP is charged with helping students go abroad and supporting them while they are there, it should place more emphasis on the often shaky transition back to campus than on future travel plans.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be fair, the OIP does make an effort to mitigate these problems by hosting a returned students reception lunch as a space for students to share their experiences and discuss their transitions back to Brown. The OIP also provides students with information about credit transfers and encourages them to reach out to CareerLAB to find out how to leverage their study abroad experiences on a professional level. These are all helpful services, but do not provide support to overcome the logistical hassles of returning. Brown should consider making a few organizational changes to streamline the process and best serve students returning back to campus after time away.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First of all, the University needs to eradicate the disconnect between the OIP and Dining Services. Simply adding a section about the meal plan cancellation policy to the OIP site and sending out an email to students with this information before the financial aid deadline would make a world of difference for those calculating financial aid and budget needs. The housing issues that come with study abroad could also be easily avoided with a little extra coordination. The OIP has access to the names of all the students who are abroad and those who will be going abroad the following semester. By putting these students in touch with each other and collaborating with the Office of Residential Life, the OIP could easily facilitate housing swaps between returning and leaving students — of course, only if students consent to having their names shared. This would allow students to learn of available rooms and choose ones that best fit their needs, rather than entering the random — and generally disappointing — housing selection process. More frequent events and academic peer support for students transitioning back to Brown’s academic structure could also help.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But most importantly, Brown and the OIP should consolidate the different services that cater to returning students. They can start by integrating information from Dining Services and ResLife into their website and alerts. If students can find all of their information in one place — or even in one email — it would be a much simpler process. This may go beyond the OIP’s stated responsibility of “manag(ing) study abroad opportunities” — but that in itself is the underlying issue. The OIP needs to recognize that the transition back to Brown is just as important as the preparation process, and take some responsibility for the student’s safe and healthy welcome back. The study abroad experience does not end when you step foot back on Brown’s campus. It is an ongoing process that requires patience, adaptation and a solid support system. If the OIP does not provide that support, then who will?</span></p>

		<title>Campanelli &#039;18: Professional athletes deserve a political voice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the weekend, President Trump unleashed a series of tweets criticizing NBA star Steph Curry’s unwillingness to accept an invitation to the White House, as well as the multitude of NFL players who have collectively refused to stand for the national anthem. While these tweets are not the first time Trump has critiqued popular sports figures, they are striking because they speak to a broader societal issue: censoring athlete’s voices.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Ever since Colin Kaepernick decided to kneel during the national anthem back in 2016, many pundits have accused the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback of disrespecting the United States and misusing his platform as an athlete. While many have used this case to debate the application of First Amendment protections, Trump’s most recent critique takes it a step further. His statements insinuate that athletes should just be quiet, play a game, make their teams money and be happy they are earning a decent salary. This sentiment is, however, deeply flawed. Despite what some say, athletes have a crucial role in speaking up, speaking out and making a difference for society. And this social engagement can take many forms: Kaepernick raising awareness about police brutality, the U.S. women’s national soccer team fighting for equal pay or Muhammad Ali protesting against the Vietnam War. All of these athletes took a stand on topics that mattered to them and made a positive difference in the public perception of these issues. Activism is not antithetical to athletics; rather, it illustrates the power of sports to be a rallying cry for larger issues. It is this behavior that shows that sports are connected to who we are as a larger society.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Further, professional athletes make millions of dollars for their respective teams, brands and communities. They have large followers of children and adults who idolize their athletic abilities and look up to them. As such, they make a significant impact on our society, and we should not relegate them to silence. They should not be told to keep their mouths shut or their opinions hidden while others make millions off them. Speaking out on political issues is their right. If they choose to speak out, they should be respected and listened to, not vilified for their failure to “stick to sports.” It is for this reason that people like Tim Tebow — who, while in the NFL, kneeled as an expression of his Christianity — should not be lampooned by the media.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this day and age of widespread political apathy, these athletes can be positive role models for change on both the left and the right. Through political activism, they can inspire people to talk about important issues that often are swept under the table — something that is crucially needed in our country. Needless to say, not everyone will agree with the message or the activism that certain professional players partake in, but that is okay. We need not agree on their message, but we do need to agree on the fact that they should not be punished for taking stands, whatever they may be.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our professional athletes do not have to be mindless jocks. They do not have to be people who only are remembered for their physical abilities. These athletes are not all just dumb competitors; they come from diverse backgrounds, educations and walks of life. They bring different experiences to the sports they play, and they should be allowed to express this however they choose. Politicians, pundits, team owners and coaches should not actively discourage political activism by athletes because in doing so, they continue to perpetuate the myth that politics can be neatly separated from other segments of life. This is frankly not true, and owners and coaches should respect the agency and independence of players who feel the need and responsibility to speak out on broader issues. This will not desecrate the “game.” It will create a more realistic sport where the players are not just people who show up for games, but individuals who can be more deeply engaged in their communities and practice their rights as citizens of this country. If athletes believe they can make a positive difference, bring attention to an issue and help move our nation forward, we should not be so quick to judge them. We should rather rally around them and engage with them. Censoring our professional athletes is not the answer. Athletes have a powerful platform, and it is time that we let them use it.</span></p>

		<title>Vilsan ’19: My mid-college crisis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a junior who came into Brown thinking she had it all figured out, I’m more confused about what I want to do with my life now than I was as a bright-eyed freshman. In high school the choices seemed black-and-white: I imagined I’d spend my undergraduate years preparing for either law, medical or business school. No matter how much I procrastinated, there had to be enough time. Don’t get me wrong, I have two years to go, but I thought I would know by now. I imagined I’d walk into a lecture class second semester freshman year, a light would go off in my brain and I’d scribble my dream profession on the cover of my notebook. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I wouldn’t be writing this article if that had happened. I now realize that juniors, however close we may be to walking out of the Van Wickle Gates, don’t need to have their lives figured out by the time they turn 21. There is value in continued exploration, and instead of giving into the pressure of mapping out a detailed life plan in your early 20s — like many Brown students feel compelled to do — we should be using our time in college to figure out our passions and skills. More often than not, the profession you’ve been trying to find amidst a sea of confusion will find you as you experiment with different opportunities during and after college.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But I’ve come to realize that you don’t have to know your exact career path right out of the gate, as long as you use your time in college to meaningfully self-reflect. Pursuing internships are the obvious answer when it comes to making up your mind: real-life, real-time experience in a profession that you might be interested in. That’s how I realized law wasn’t for me (a girl can change her mind, though). It turns out a law office simply doesn’t work the way you would imagine it would based on a Suits episode. Without my summer job at a law firm, I never would’ve known the difference. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At Brown, though, we too easily fall into the trap of pursuing internships that look glitzy and glamorous on a resume, instead of using them as tools of self-discovery. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve met at investment banking info sessions who simply didn’t want to be there — but were there anyway, looking for a resume booster to catch a future employer’s eye. Unfortunately, this isn’t the way to find the job or the career that’s best for you. This isn’t how you’re going to make the best use of your skills or truly discover your passions. Though for some it’s hard to resist the allure of a brand name, blindly and reflexively pursuing a career for the prestige ultimately distracts you from understanding what you really want to do with your life. That’s why we should seriously reevaluate how we use our summers and the priorities we set for ourselves in college. Even though internships can’t solve the career puzzle for you entirely, they can definitely find the corners if you use them right. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You may be thinking to yourself: Why are we even listening to you? I did say from the very beginning that I’m feeling confused. I wish I could spill secrets and cautionary tales from several years in the workforce, learning from my scholastic mistakes and finding a one-way ticket to a tailor-made career. But, as it turns out, we’re all in the same boat. And, at least for me, it feels good to know that I’m not sailing on my own. It can feel alienating to attend information sessions where everyone seems to know exactly what they want. As students, we ought to try to be more open about our insecurities and uncertainties. By being open with ourselves and with our peers, we might be able to avoid the hysteria surrounding the few, elite jobs that seem attractive — because of the sheer number of applicants — but do not guarantee any professional satisfaction. And we might better be able to use our liberal arts education in service of our own fulfillment and our own interests.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We’ve all had our share of awkward dinner encounters, with our relatives asking us, “So what do you want to do?” only to be met with our blank stares. At times, it may seem like you’re moving backwards, away from the narrow path you thought you wanted into a pool of possibility. Don’t be fooled. Nobody expects you to know exactly what you want from the minute you step out of your dorm into the real world. A quick conversation with most adults will lead you to the realization that many of their jobs today have nothing to do with their post-graduation offers. Limiting yourself to a particular career path in your early 20s often does just that. At the risk of sounding cliche, perhaps one of the most fulfilling journeys you embark upon as a 20-something is that of professional self-discovery. Don’t rob yourself of that experience by setting a graduation deadline for your future career.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Last week, Rolling Stone co-founder Jann Wenner <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/rolling-stone-magazine-to-be-sold/2017/09/17/e180d06a-9c1e-11e7-b2a7-bc70b6f98089_story.html">announced</a> the sale of the iconic publication that has been both reporting and influencing pop culture since 1967. The sale of the magazine demonstrates a broader decline in print media, which is a daunting subject to tackle in writing or even think about. I will always be a champion of physical copies, cherishing the illicit dog ears that track the quest through a novel and safeguarding that familiar scent that blankets any reader who finds themselves nose-close to a good story.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Although my literature-centric brain is usually focused on the closings of bookstores nationwide and the transitioning of traditional book sales to e-books, Wenner’s sale caught my attention as a particular omen of the demise of an era. Rolling Stone was once a symbol of counterculture relics. Now, perhaps, it also encompasses a time when print was in fashion. Even as print declines, we should still push ourselves to pick up physical copies of publications we love, given the benefits print provides.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the dramatic twists of second grade, the only constant was the glimpse of a colorful cover of Highlights on the kitchen table, my name printed in the address box. American Girl and Seventeen were the silent instructors of confusing pre-teen years, not only ready to provide advice, but also to simply reassure me that everyone else had the same questions. In my current, extremely sophisticated collegiate life, the New Yorker is the reason I put up with the mailroom crowds every week. I flip to the comic contest first. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Clearly, print magazine subscriptions have much sentimental value to me. They have, in essence, chronicled my life, and I am sure others feel the same. Yet there are reasons beyond personal nostalgia to defend print journalism. Spotting another subway rider clutching the same issue of Time Magazine elicits similar feelings as conversations about the last night’s episode of “American Idol” once did, when no one was three seasons behind and everyone was ready to talk specifics of the most recent details. Netflix and binge-watching culture may have supplanted these moments in the television realm, but magazines allow a re-creation of this feeling in real time. The community behind a publication is physically visible through print distribution, fostering a profound sense of unity for its members. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Amidst a devastating amount of e-distractions, the print magazine is a sanctuary of singular focus. Rather than being tempted by the colorful floating dock of applications at the bottom of my screen when reading on my computer, having a publication in my hands allows me to read content free of distraction. Not surprisingly, studies have found that print readers retain plot information better than their Kindle counterparts, scoring significantly better on story comprehension <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/05/reading-on-screen-versus-paper/">assessments</a>. Considering this disparity in comprehension between print and electronic readers, perhaps we can extend this to mean that the former establishes a connection with the text more easily and quickly. One study found that when reading an upsetting story on paper versus on an iPad, those who used print media scored higher on measures of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/19/readers-absorb-less-kindles-paper-study-plot-ereader-digitisation">empathy</a>. In other words, reading anything from a New York Magazine <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html">article</a> warning about climate change to a personal disclosure of fears with the <a href="http://time.com/4952594/donald-trump-daca-deadline-dreamers/">repealing</a> of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in print would allow the best connection to the content. Not only being educated in a topic, but also feeling a personal connection to it is perhaps what motivates more genuine and impassioned engagement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Though many publications provide great deals on their print subscriptions, the cost of buying print magazines often means reading articles online is more financially accessible. You can still read physical copies without a cost. Public libraries help make print publications more available. Walk a few feet off campus to the Providence Athenaeum’s vast collection of publications, free to explore. Pick up a copy of the New York Times in the Sciences Library’s lobby. In weighing your decision to splurge or seek out physical copies, consider the research that has shown the significant disparity in impressionability between print and online media. Besides the meaningful connection you might feel toward the text due to a surge in empathy, you will retain what you read in print much better than what you read <a href="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/archive/media/2011/08/66_mediummatters.pdf">online</a>. In other words, you truly get what you pay for when it comes to swapping a URL for glossy pages.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">On a local scale, the ability for student publications to distribute print versions is essential. Whether this involves an eager editor offering copies outside the Sharpe Refectory or a waiting stack of issues on the front desk in the Stephen Roberts ’62 Campus Center, the benefits extend past establishing and bonding a community of readers. It also increases the visibility and accessibility of these publications. Whereas a new first-year or a graduating senior may be unaware of some of Brown’s online gems, encountering a physical reminder of the existence of a publication increases awareness and readership. This is advantageous for both the contributors, whose work thus has a larger reach, and the readers, who reap the pleasure of reading something that could have remained hidden in the realm of online publications. And perhaps you’ll find that reading something in print, distraction-free, could be one of the highlights of your day.</span></p>

		<title>Richardson ’20: Picture perfect</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/27/picture-perfect/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2017 01:35:11 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I lean in for a picture with a group of friends. I am in the front row and sitting beside two girls, one white and the other black. As we pose, the white girl in between us turns to the crowd behind and says, “Oh my God! I’m going to look so pale in this picture! Look who I’m sitting next to!” My group of friends erupts in laughter as I blink my eyes in disbelief, and the other black girl jokingly says, “I know, right!”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even now, a few days later, this entire exchange takes me aback because this presumably well-intentioned joke so obliviously mirrored the colorist language that still exists on this campus and across the country. For a start, it isolates black students and students of color by making them feel self-conscious and separate from the group, and it serves as a reminder that students of color face unique barriers as they move through campus. From where I sit as a black woman, it is significantly more difficult for black students to navigate the social circles on campus. Take the party scene, for example: I often walk into crowded rooms only to find a few other people of color in a sea of a hundred. In this context, “jokes” about skin color only highlight the differences in perceived social capital attached to darker-skinned folks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Which leads to the second issue with this incident: It perpetuates unofficial popularity contests and historically-exclusive beauty standards. My friend’s humorous outrage over her appearance next to us caters to the idea that attractiveness is somehow linked to skin tone — that there is a color palette to how we perceive beauty. Comments like “I’m going to look so pale” feed into the idea that there is a “perfect” golden tone; “too pale” is frowned upon for some unknown reason, and apparently “too dark” is laughed at because it magnifies paleness. They propagate the wrongful internalization of ideals that undervalue beautiful, kissed-by-God, melanated skin. And when laughter arises after a colorist joke, and one of only two dark-skinned students in the group says, “I know, right,” it leaves the second student searching for camaraderie in the face of colorism and anti-blackness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On top of that, the joke erases the fraught history of colorism and how reductive statements like this have a great impact on the lived experiences of people of color. Comparing skin tones has its roots in some of the darkest moments of American history, when enslaved people were separated by skin tone: Those with lighter skin generally received better living arrangements, assignments and food. Flash forward 300 years, and this same sentiment is echoed on a campus that was established with wealth accumulated from the slave trade. This is part of the reason why black students can have an especially complicated relationship with the colorist language expressed on campus and in the United States. This language attests to the contradiction that students of color are sent acceptance letters to Brown, but are still not accepted into the culture and atmosphere on campus. Colorism, even when unintentional, is isolating.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most jokes don’t carry this much weight and are easily seen for what they are: jokes. </span><span class="s2"> But there are still light-skinned–dark-skinned rivalries within communities of color around the country. Add in the reality that minorities in positions of power are frequently light-skinned or white-passing professionals, and one will realize the racist attitudes of the Jim Crow era may still live on in other forms.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is 2017. It is long past time to eradicate the unjust treatment of black and brown bodies. Yet it is evident that we have failed to move past these race-based misperceptions and disparities. Take, for example, the riots in Charlottesville. Or the 2016 Presidential campaign and election. Or Maria Sharapova getting more endorsements than Serena Williams when Williams was the top-ranked tennis player in the world. Or Colin Kaepernick being unofficially ousted from the NFL after performing a peaceful protest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whether we admit it or not, colorism and racism are still alive and well. They continue to live through jokes that are told and the speech that is tolerated. Laughing away issues and statements that have historical prominence silently encourage their continuation. It’s unrealistic to think that things will become picture perfect overnight, but a collective effort towards its eradication would certainly speed up the process.</span></p>

		<title>Friedman ’19: Giving Brown heat about AC</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Returning to Brown in September is always a bittersweet process for me. Not for the reasons you think: Of course, I hate leaving home and the lack of responsibility that summer affords me. But I also hate returning to Brown because, on campus, I cannot walk anywhere more than two minutes away, especially in September, without drenching myself in sweat. And when I get there, I only sweat more because it’s usually 90 degrees outside and the majority of University buildings do not have air conditioning or adequate ventilation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sometimes I eat lunch at the Ratty, but I always make sure to take double the napkins I need so that I can wipe my face down with them when I start panting and perspiring uncontrollably. It’s inevitable, even more so when I sit at a table close to a pizza oven, which raises the temperature in the immediate area 10 or 15 degrees, making the air feel like a furnace. Let’s not forget that dining services employees must work in this heat all summer, often confined to the back kitchens where ventilation is even worse. Occasionally I have to retire myself to the Ratty restroom mid-lunch so I can pat my entire body down with paper towels. It’s unpleasant. This process continues throughout the day unless I happen to be lucky enough to have a lecture in an air-conditioned building like MacMillan or 85 Waterman St.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As someone who was born and raised in Dallas, Texas, I am no stranger to hot weather. The real unfamiliarity is coping with hot weather without any sort of air circulation or ventilation. I realize that this issue is nothing new; in fact it may be one of the University’s oldest problems, and perhaps that is why it has not been addressed for so long. Yet I suspect few students, professors or staff members can honestly say that they have never complained about the lack of air conditioning or cooling in our buildings before. It may seem like a trivial issue compared to many of the other structural issues the University is battling, but given all of the funding going toward construction and renovation, can’t a small percentage of that be spent on some form of cooling system or proper ventilation, at least for central spaces?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Blaming Brown entirely would be a little unfair, as our campus’ lack of central cooling is also a historical problem that stems from air conditioning’s unique and geographic basis in the United States. Air conditioning was invented in 1902 in New York by Willis Carrier, but 63 years later, it was only adopted by 10 percent of U.S. households. Air condition enabled rapid population growth in the Sunbelt cities during the latter half of the 20th century. Millions of air conditioners were sold every year in the 1960s, and this trend only continued in the successive decades.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As of 2011, 87 percent of American households own an air conditioner or central air system, according to the Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But just as these Sun Belt cities have depended on air conditioning for the majority of their history, the United States’ older, eastern cities have always gone without it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The unfortunate consequence of this history is that a lack of air conditioning in many of New England’s older buildings today is the status quo. It may very well be that much of Brown lacks air conditioning because it’s just plain old. Though approximately 86 percent of new single-family homes in the Northeast are now built with air conditioning, most of Brown’s campus is far from the label “new” and “single-family” (I would actually classify most Brown buildings as “prehistoric” and “multi-family”). And central air conditioning is, as you might have expected, extremely expensive — an AC unit can cost up to $3,400, without factoring in the cost of duct work and the extra energy costs. The cost of implementing this across Brown’s dorms and the Ratty would easily reach into the tens of thousands of dollars, a steep ask from a tight 2017 budget that has only allocated 10.21 percent of its funds to auxiliary operations, down 5 percent from last year’s budget. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are also valid environmental arguments against implementing central cooling across Brown’s dorms — namely that air-conditioning contributes to intensive energy demand that drives climate change, making the world hotter. Perhaps we don’t need to outfit the entire campus with air conditioning immediately. But I suggest that Brown at least make an attempt to retrofit the Ratty with central air conditioning. Although this is expensive upfront, the change will bring comfort to students, faculty and especially staff members working through the heat. Just because New England has typically lagged behind in installing AC doesn’t mean that we need to take the heat any longer.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Last week, the U.S. Senate — a chamber charged with safeguarding the “national character” and resisting the “impulse of sudden and violent passions,” according to our founding fathers — voted to increase the defense budget by $80 billion. That’s enough money to pay for the elimination of tuition at four-year public universities in the United States, a reform that might benefit a system of higher education that, according to President Trump, currently leaves “our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge.” (Who knows, maybe missiles and fighter jets can fix our national character and our schools.) This extraordinary surge in military spending passed by a comfortable margin, 89-8. An overwhelming majority of Democrats, even the ones who promised to “keep fighting back” and “stand with the people of the country” in the aftermath of Trump’s election, voted in favor of the budget.</p>
<p class="p3">Thankfully, we live in a federal republic; that means legislators in Washington, D.C. don’t wield a complete monopoly on the country’s future. Individual states have the power to chart their own course, even in defiance of the White House — and in the past couple of months, some have been vigorously exercising that power. Lawmakers in California have unveiled an ambitious regulatory agenda to strengthen environmental protections that the Trump administration may try to dismantle. And in April, New York announced a program to make the state’s public colleges and universities tuition-free. But California and New York are populous, wealthy states; in the Trump era, their flashy, large-scale, and expensive pushes toward long-standing progressive dreams are poor models for states closer to the mean.</p>
<p class="p3">That, my dear reader, is where Rhode Island enters the picture. As it turns out, there is a whole state — with a General Assembly, a governor and the fourth-largest domed marble building in the world for a State House! — beyond College Hill. Admittedly, it’s easy to overlook the happenings of the smallest state in the Union, but it’s worth our while to pay attention.</p>
<p class="p3">In the face of dysfunction and alt-right regress at the national level, Rhode Island is incontrovertible evidence that it doesn’t take an enormous tax base or garish promises to meaningfully enact a progressive agenda — one that actually makes a difference in the lives of average Americans.</p>
<p class="p3">Just this week, Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a bill that guarantees sick leave to 100,000 workers in Rhode Island starting in 2018. According to the new law, which benefits nine-in-10 working Rhode Islanders, workers in smaller firms will be entitled to three unpaid sick days per year; workers at larger companies will have access to five paid sick days by 2020. More impressive than the scope of the bill, though, is how it came to exist in the first place. A grassroots coalition of labor, healthcare and human rights advocates, organized by the left-leaning Working Families Party, used state and local elections to promulgate the importance of paid sick leave. As the Intercept reported, four WFP candidates, recruited for their progressive pedigree and commitment to paid leave policies, ran as Democrats and defeated right-leaning incumbents. By approaching local and state elections with energetic progressivism, activists were able to produce positive results for an entire state. It’s not black magic. Grassroots organizing wins votes, and that’s what Democrats — who are minorities in both chambers of Congress and at an all-time low in state legislatures — desperately need: votes.</p>
<p class="p3">Under Raimondo’s leadership, Rhode Island has also been on the frontlines in supporting immigrants and making college more affordable. (Full disclosure: I interned with the Governor’s office last fall; I was an awful intern — but I was a big fan, if that counts.) Last week, Raimondo revealed that Rhode Island had secured $170,000 to pay for the $495 fee that undocumented residents protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program need to extend their status. (Currently, 1,200 Rhode Island residents are recipients of DACA; up to 350 are eligible for status renewal.) And a few days ago, Raimondo celebrated the one-year anniversary of her plan to reduce the financial burden of college course materials, known as the Open Textbook Initiative. The College Board estimates that students at four-year public colleges spend nearly $1,200 annually on books; at Rhode Island College, the initiative has saved students close to $100,000 in 2016.</p>
<p class="p3">In the age of Trump, when a single tweet can upend the news cycle and maybe start a war or two, Rhode Island’s experience may appear insignificant. But it does offer crucial lessons for progressives across the country. For example, it seems wise to pursue incremental legislative change that will benefit people in the immediate term, as opposed to grander, less politically practical projects. That is, before we start clamoring for a single-payer healthcare system — which will require a dramatic overhaul of the country’s healthcare infrastructure and remains hopelessly unpopular among conservatives — we ought to make sure American workers have access to more basic benefits, like paid sick leave. (Before Rhode Island adopted them, only seven U.S. states and Washington, D.C. had paid leave policies in place.)</p>
<p class="p3">Of course, I can’t seriously pretend that Rhode Island’s recent policy initiatives, no matter how egalitarian, are going to magically compensate for Trump’s retrogressive proposals or deconstruct the impregnable grip of establishment politics. They won’t automatically give all Rhode Islanders easier access to college, healthier working conditions, or a better shot at surviving abrupt upheavals in immigration policy. They’re not easily replicable in other states. And they certainly won’t solve all of the state’s problems.</p>
<p class="p3">But, in totality, they do paint a picture of tremendous hope. Rhode Island has shown that it is possible, even for smaller states, to triumph over uncertainty and embrace a kinder, smarter sort of politics; and that it is possible, still, for people to come together, take care of each other and construct a more compassionate society. The fundamental precept of our democracy, that ordinary people can bring about extraordinary change, has not yet been extinguished. That is something Rhode Islanders — and all Americans who care about salvaging decency and dignity in our political culture — ought to be extremely proud of. True greatness, after all, comes from small beginnings. Or, in this case, from really, really small states.</p>

		<title>Renshaw &#039;20: Fighting the tech gender gap at Brown</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last week, the New York Times published a piece entitled “Push for Gender Equality in Tech? Some Men Say It’s Gone Too Far.” The men in the article argue that Silicon Valley gender diversity initiatives are unnecessary, and that tech companies have completely closed the gender gap. But, in reality, we’re not even close. In 2015, women held only 25 percent of all computing jobs, a figure that has been declining since 1991, when it was at 37 percent. At Brown, nine of the 40 faculty members of the computer science department are women. The gender gap isn’t caused by biological differences between genders or lack of interest in computer science. It is caused by systemic issues perpetuated by those in the tech world — including<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>universities like Brown, where computer science is the most popular concentration ­— that make it less accessible to non-male participants. Gender inequality in tech is a real problem, and colleges have a responsibility to use their influence and clout to take action.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gender discrepancies in computer science at Brown might not be immediately apparent. The introductory sequences seem to have a pretty good balance of women and men, and a lot of the teaching assistants are women. Unfortunately, as you move into upper level classes, there are fewer and fewer women. As a computer science concentrator and a teaching assistant myself, I’ve noticed many reasons for this imbalance. I certainly felt that several students, especially men, in the introductory sequence I took my freshman year had more coding experience and that I wouldn’t ever be able to match them. In addition, imposter syndrome — which describes individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a “fraud” — is something that particularly impacts women in the department. That is probably because success for women is often contradicted by societal expectations; women just aren’t expected to do well in STEM fields. To make the computer science department more inclusive and retain more women, professors need to explicitly address the self-doubt that female students may feel, particularly at the introductory level. In addition, they should remind students that bragging about how fast they finished projects or how easy things are is unhealthy, because those projects might not be easy for everybody. Simple acts like this could help students stick with a field they enjoy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Further, improving the gender diversity of TA staffs can encourage more women to participate in the computer science department. At a mandatory diversity training I attended this fall for computer science TAs, I was struck by how few of the upper level course TAs were female. Sure, I was the only female TA on my staff, but I didn’t realize this would be true for almost every course represented. Some TAs at the training even voiced their concerns about how to treat women fairly in their course, given their staff had no women at all. Since the TA system is such a big part of the computer science department at Brown (this semester there are over 250 TAs), the department needs to do more to make sure the TA staff for every class is diverse. “I really like having female TAs because they have served as role models and mentors to me,” said Eleanor Avril ’20, a friend of mine who studies computer science. “I’ve had some really great male TAs, certainly, but sometimes I feel more of an immediate connection with my female TAs.” But hiring female TAs can be hard to do if women don’t take upper level classes. In the class that I am a TA for, only one of every six students is female. Again, this is why it’s so important to make sure that women who are interested in computer science stick with it. The fewer women who progress to upper level courses, the fewer women TAs for those courses — which creates a vicious cycle of exclusion. And, though there may be smaller applicant pools of women for TA positions in certain courses, the department should do its best to refrain from hiring all-male TA staffs. Revisiting hiring practices for TAs is a concrete step Brown can take to make sure that women continue to feel comfortable and supported in the department.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those of us in the tech world, nothing regarding the gender gap in technology is news. It’s an issue we hear about every single day. At Brown, we have a responsibility to take action to rectify this discrepancy. To its credit, Brown does okay: 37 percent of computer science graduates at Brown are women, which is not an impressive number, but it’s better than the national average. Student-led initiatives like Women in Computer Science, Women in Science and Engineering and diversity advocacy in the computer science department are amazing, but the work can’t stop there. The pipeline begins through education, and we ought to arm women with the tools and drive they need to succeed in the tech world. Brown’s own faculty seem to agree. Tom Doeppner, associate professor of research of computer science and vice chair of the Department of Computer Science, told me, “I have a granddaughter who has just started high school and is showing some interest in computer science — I really want her to have a fair chance at succeeding if she decides to go on with (it).” Let’s stop pretending that the gender gap has been solved or is a joke or is less of an issue than it really is. Let’s instead promote the measures already in place and push our universities to take these initiatives even further.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My mother has breast cancer. It takes a lot for me to write that.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was caught early. The timeline, as it often does in times of trauma, flashes in bits and pieces. I remember whispered conversations in the shoe aisles of thrift stores. There are the hushed phone calls, the second opinions and the blood tests. My family, filled with experienced and knowledgeable doctors, sitting silently in a room with nothing to say. She had surgery as I flew back to campus this semester, and her chemotherapy will continue on through Thanksgiving, Christmas and the next year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Cancer, the emperor of all maladies,” <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/siddhartha-mukherjee">writes</a> Siddhartha Mukherjee in his 2011 Pulitzer Prize-winning book. It is an insidious disease, thriving in the shadows and recurring out of the blue. It can hide in the prostate and emerge in the brain or the lungs. It kills, often tragically and painfully. And, as researchers are currently studying, its causes can be passed down from generation to generation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> My grandmother had breast cancer. Her husband, my grandfather, died of cancer. For families like mine, with patterns of recurrence, the standard protocol is genetic testing. And so, last month, my mother deposited another sample of blood and the fear of cancer entered another person’s chapter: mine.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As students and young adults, we often think in terms of immortality. We might complain about exams or the pace of classes, but most of us view life as demarcated by years, even decades, rather than months or weeks. Very few of us are unlucky enough to become preoccupied with death — our own and others’. But trust me, many students are. Society may celebrate the causes célèbres, such as Lady Gaga coming out with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/lady-gaga-netflix-documentary-gaga-five-foot-two-chronic-pain-fibromyalgia-joanne-tour-canceled">fibromyalgia</a> or Selena Gomez getting a kidney transplant for her <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/14/entertainment/selena-gomez-kidney-transplant/index.html">Lupus</a>. Hell, Julia Louis-Dreyfus just came out with her own <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/entertainment/julia-louis-dreyfus-cancer/index.html">breast cancer diagnosis</a> and used it to advocate for accessible national healthcare. But a good majority of health issues impact people, including people on campus, who aren’t afforded that kind of exposure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cancer and disease in general are often talked about in whispers, with shame or a sort of pity. At least for my family, it’s something we kept within closed walls, as a private matter. Even then, my mom didn’t tell me about her diagnosis for weeks. But I think that all sickness, physical or mental, thrives on isolation and secrecy. And I’ve learned in the worst possible way that it’s not enough to talk about these things — we have to actually engage with them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. It is part of a long cycle of events across the country and on campus to raise money for one sickness or another. <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2005/01/31/rubida-05-never-quit/">Brown Football Bench Press for Cancer</a>. Relay for Life. It is very easy to fall into this pattern of participation, where you take part in a challenge for five minutes, raise some money and move on with your life. I know I have done this in the past: Anybody remember the Ice Bucket Challenge? Do we still remember what we raised money for? It becomes easy for these activities to become mere words on a resume, a social activity or part of an afterthought. But<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we should take the time to Google search Lawrence Rubida ’05, a Brown football player whose death led to the first Bench Press for Cancer. We should follow up with students on medical leave, because these are the people who are directly impacted. We shouldn’t forget them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sickness is ubiquitous in society, but how we deal with disease varies immensely. Communities in college are unique because they completely turn over their populations in four years. Trends can rise and fall and things can be forgotten, no matter how much they mattered once upon a time. But the momentum we gain for disease awareness should not lose energy at the end of the month, or the end of the academic year or even after our time at Brown. We cannot overlook the individuals in our own communities who face illness even after the awareness month, the bench presses and the video challenges end.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Every year, I shop ANTH 0300: “Culture and Health,” and every year I have to drop it because it doesn’t fit in with my schedule. I’ve kept the syllabus, nevertheless, and have slowly made my way through the reading list on my own time. There is a graphic novel, “Cancer Vixen,” about a hip, fashionable New Yorker who survived breast cancer; she is supported by her own mother, her fiancé and a nearly endless list of friends. She fights, she suffers and she ultimately survives. Her story offers a visceral look on what it really means to be affected by sickness. I often wondered why the class is asked to read such a narrative in the first few weeks of the course. But after giving a copy to my mom, I think I know.</span></p>

		<title>Mulligan ’19: It’s bloody time for change</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a senior in high school, I wrote an article for my school’s newspaper about how, despite undergoing a $100-million renovation, our restrooms had no receptacles for menstrual products. I assumed that this would be a problem left in the past, as I headed off to an institution with a multibillion dollar endowment that, while small for the Ivy League, still seemed like enough to cover basic necessities.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The last time I flushed a pad down a toilet was in the upstairs bathroom of my dorm. My first period of the semester had just begun, and foolishly, I hadn’t scoped out the territory before sitting down to relieve myself. Although my floormates and I treat the bathroom as gender neutral, it is labeled as a women’s room. I naively thought that both stalls would be equipped with receptacles for hygiene products. I was wrong. My options were to toss a bloodied sanitary napkin into the open trashcan outside the stalls, revealing my fertility status to anyone standing at the sink, or to flush it. You already know what choice I made.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The toilet didn’t clog, thankfully, and so I’m able to tell this story in jest. But my experience could have gone much worse. If Brown wants to be a fully accessible campus, they should have receptacles for menstrual products in all bathroom stalls.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ensuring that all bathrooms are fully equipped with trash cans is a basic measure to preserve plumbing. Pads and tampons, which are designed for absorbency, can swell and cause serious blockages inside pipes. Brown’s maintenance crew has enough on its hands without having to deal with easily preventable problems. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is, of course, the option to walk out of the stall, holding a bloodied object wrapped in toilet paper and drop it into the trashcan. I have done this in the past, and I will continue to do it during moments when I am less frustrated over institutions’ inabilities to offer basic amenities. But there are also reasons why people shouldn’t have to hold onto their hygiene products until they’re finished doing their business.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For one thing, I prefer to keep my cycle between me and my period tracking app. As this piece suggests, I don’t think periods are anything to be ashamed of, and I’ll openly admit that I have one. But that doesn’t mean that I want to announce it to my floormates by exiting a stall and casually tossing a used sanitary napkin into the bathroom trashcan while they try to brush their teeth in peace.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To another point, blood smells. It especially smells when it’s in a hot room that regularly fills with steam when students shower. The receptacles in bathroom stalls are almost always either covered or installed with flaps that close automatically, keeping in the scent and keeping out any bugs attracted to bodily fluids.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But the consequences of having to openly dispose of a pad or a tampon can go beyond the unhygienic annoyance that such an experience represents for me, a cisgender woman. Brown made <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/09/09/free-tampons-for-all-at-brown-university-this-school-year-even-in-the-mens-room/?utm_term=.1a713e78472a">national</a> headlines in 2016, when the Undergraduate Council of Students announced that sanitary products would be available in all non-residential bathrooms, including restrooms designated for men. The success of that initiative remains debatable: I have yet to see a single tampon in a non-residential bathroom this semester, though it is possible that their absence just means that people are using them up quicker than they can be restocked.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What isn’t debatable is that not everyone who menstruates at Brown will be using women’s bathrooms. Sometimes they’ll be more comfortable in bathrooms specifically designated as gender-neutral. Sometimes, as in my dorm, students will use whatever bathroom is closest to their room, regardless of how it is labelled. Sometimes people are transgender men and will use only men’s bathrooms, because, well, they’re men.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For some, walking out of a stall with a used pad in hand isn’t just mildly embarrassing. It’s an experience that requires them to out themselves to anyone else in the bathroom. Besides the emotional distress that sometimes comes with revealing sex assigned at birth, this opens students to confrontations, even physical violence, from other bathroom-goers upset at the idea that transgender <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf">folks</a> use the same restrooms as them. There’s no choice when your options are risking the plumbing or risking your safety.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Putting receptacles for pads and tampons in all bathroom stalls across campus may seem like a small gesture, primarily benefiting the university’s sewage system. Still, it would positively impact many members of the Brown community, making our campus safer and more inclusive. And that would be a bloody good thing.</span></p>

		<title>Mitra &#039;18: Why ‘Free Speech Week’ was bound to fail</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last week, the infamous Free Speech Week at the University of California at Berkeley was officially <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/09/23/uc-berkeley-says-free-speech-week-is-canceled-milo-yiannopoulos-says-hes-still-coming-to-campus/">cancelled</a>. This was not altogether surprising given that it had been poorly organized from the start. The coordinators repeatedly missed deadlines to register their events, failed to book rooms on time and apparently listed several public figures as speakers without their <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/how-milo-yiannopoulos-berkeley-free-speech-week-fell-apart/540867/">approval</a>. What was surprising, however, was that anyone could believe this travesty of an event was about free speech in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For those who have wisely steered clear of the news emerging from Berkeley recently, here’s a little context: after protests over right-wing speakers rocked the campus in the spring, a student group called Berkeley Patriot decided to organize a four-day right-wing extravaganza — publicized as the “<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-milo-berkeley-antifa-20170925-htmlstory.html">Coachella of Conservatism</a>” — ostensibly in support of free speech. They invited prominent provocateurs Milo Yiannopoulos, Pamela Geller, Ann Coulter and Steve Bannon to campus to share their controversial views. Needless to say, this did not go over well with the diverse and predominantly liberal Berkeley community — a community that had already experienced violence on their doorsteps after protests disrupted a scheduled Yiannopoulos talk in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/us/milo-yiannopoulos-berkeley/index.html">February</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The campus had been gearing up for the week — and the inevitable demonstrations that would have followed — when news emerged that Berkeley Patriot had cancelled the event. This led to immediate backlash from right-wing supporters who accused Berkeley of shutting down free <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/09/23/free-speech-dead-at-berkeley-milo-event-canceled-after-pressure-from-university/">speech</a>. Yiannopoulos, who worked with the student organizers to host the event, boldly accused the university administration of doing <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Confusing-turns-over-status-of-Free-Speech-Week-12223234.php">“everything in its power to crush its own students’ aspirations.”</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Let’s set aside the fact that the event seems to have been cancelled because of the incompetence of its organizers. This criticism rests on the assumption that Free Speech Week was actually about, well, free speech. It wasn’t.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If the rally were indeed about promoting free and open discourse on college campuses, the organizers wouldn’t have only invited speakers from the far right. They wouldn’t have organized a campus-wide festival without significant student input or buy-in. They wouldn’t have been so secretive about their event planning and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/milo-yiannopouloss-berkeley-fyre-festival-for-the-right">logistics</a>. And they wouldn’t have chosen a figure as polarizing as Yiannopoulos to be the public face of the event.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Free Speech Week was designed for no other purpose than to be a slap in the face. By inviting the most inflammatory speakers imaginable, the coordinators were deliberately trying to provoke Berkeley students — and, in light of the violent protests in February, members of local anti-fascist <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-berkeley-far-left-protests-milo-20170830-story.html">groups</a> — into retaliating. Inciting a strong response would embellish the reductive narrative that liberal students are at war with free speech — a narrative that has proven remarkably effective with conservatives thus far.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is also no coincidence that the organizers chose to target Berkeley, one of the most diverse campuses in the country. Approximately 18 percent of its undergraduate students are from underrepresented groups and 29 percent are first-generation <a href="https://diversity.berkeley.edu/reports-data/diversity-data-dashboard">students</a>. The university has a large number of undocumented students as well. On the other hand, many of the invited speakers have built their brands on race-baiting, xenophobia and anti-immigrant rhetoric. With this in mind, it is clear the speakers weren’t just seeking a platform to share their views — they were seeking one with the greatest potential to isolate and divide. In some ways, they were successful: many students, particularly students of color, reported feeling unsafe and unwelcome on the campus in the lead-up to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/berkeley-free-speech.html?mcubz=0&amp;_r=0">event</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nor did the event’s substance seem worthy of its extravagant cost. Berkeley expected to spend as much as $1 million, including at least $300,000 to not only “protect the speakers but also to protect the value of free speech,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/opinion/milo-yiannopoulos-free-speech-week-berkeley.html">according</a> to President of the University of California Janet Napolitano. These funds — an enormous outlay for an already debt-burdened campus — could have easily been used to bring in conservative speakers with more expertise and knowledge. And this doesn’t even account for the costs of campus disruption: Prominent academics like anthropologist Anna Tsing had to reschedule their visits to Berkeley in light of the event. So would Free Speech Week have fostered freedom of expression or undercut constructive dialogue in favor of provocation for provocation’s sake? I suspect the latter.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Don’t get me wrong: I absolutely believe that free speech is worth promoting on college campuses. According to a new study from the Brookings Institution, over <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/09/18/views-among-college-students-regarding-the-first-amendment-results-from-a-new-survey/">40 percent of college students</a> seem to misunderstand the First Amendment. This does not bode well for dialogue and diversity of opinion on campuses, and universities should work to address this. But stunts like Berkeley’s Free Speech Week only undermine that cause.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Still, there might actually be one positive thing to come out of the event: Yiannopoulos and his crew of misfits just showed the country what not to do when standing up for freedom of expression. Here’s hoping they learn from it.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Sept. 26, Twitter announced that the character limit on tweets would be doubled from 140 to 280 characters for a select group of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/technology/twitter-280-characters.html">users</a>. This marks the first time since its launch in 2006 that Twitter is changing this standard. Predictably, the shift has sparked a passionate debate within the Twittersphere over the necessity of extra characters. Some, including myself, believe this change is unnecessary and goes against what Twitter has traditionally stood for.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For Twitter purists, this change seems to undermine the very purpose of tweets: to share concise news in a form that is globally accessible. Twitter was created for users to be frugal with their words and stick to essential information. In what has come to define our generation — the generation of social media — people want the most important information as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On the other hand, Twitter has been heavily criticized in recent years for failing to expand their platform and profit. The company has been steadily losing money — at least $2 <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/21/technology/twitter-10th-anniversary/index.html">billion</a> between 2011 and 2016. Twitter is also having trouble attracting new users. From 2011 through 2014, the number of Twitter accounts grew from 68 million to 288 million. In the three years since, Twitter accounts have only increased to 328 <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/">million</a>. This deceleration has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-results/twitter-shares-tumble-as-user-growth-stalls-idUSKBN1AC1NJ">scaring investors off</a> for a few years. For a company that almost entirely depends on ad revenue, these statistics are an ominous sign.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Twitter believes its character expansion will attract new users, as well as improve their content — a claim that is well up for discussion.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is notable that the general public didn’t exactly clamor for this change. People never asked for more characters, although they may have contributed to the change unintentionally. Many users post pictures of longer messages or rant through tweet storms, in which a user replies to their own tweets in a long chain. But again, why does Twitter feel this move is necessary? The change doesn’t seem to have been motivated by any one event, and it could even discourage people from using the platform. The majority of users browse Twitter on their smartphones rather than computers, and a block of text double the size of what they are used to can be intimidating and frustrating to read, forcing users to scroll more. And let’s not forget tweeters like Twitter because of its brevity. The news is quicker, the jokes are simpler and the statements are sweeter — there’s no need for any more space. Twitter should leave the longer posts to Facebook.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If this move expands to all accounts, it will be interesting to see how news outlets, politicians and celebrities take advantage of the extra character space — especially political leaders such as President Trump, who is not a part of the initial beta group. As president, Trump’s use of Twitter has raised the issue of how professional and presidential the platform is and should be. On Twitter, he routinely announces policy changes before official <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/26/trump-transgender-military-ban-behind-the-scenes-240990">statements</a> and, most recently, disparaged the NFL players who have kneeled during the national anthem. Who knows what someone like Trump could say with all the extra space? How many more “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/sep/27/brevity-soul-twitter-280-characters">covfefes</a>” will he fail to proofread?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Likewise, news outlets will need to decide whether they want to keep their updates brief or risk losing the short attention span of users. As a user who follows many news organizations, I have a feeling they will begin to include more than necessary. Twitter headlines are supposed to be punchy and act as clickbait, reaching as many users as possible, so the shift could have implications for the accessibility of news and information in a time when news credibility and dissemination are critical.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Still, this isn’t the end of Twitter as we know it. Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey admitted the 140 character limit was completely arbitrary. In a tweet announcing the test, Dorsey wrote, “This is a small change, but a big move for us. 140 was an arbitrary choice based on the 160 character SMS limit. Proud of how thoughtful the team has been in solving a real problem people have when trying to tweet. And at the same time maintain our brevity, speed and essence!” It’s clear that Dorsey believes this move won’t affect the way users consume their information. Funnily enough, one intrepid user <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2017/sep/27/brevity-soul-twitter-280-characters">edited</a> Dorsey’s tweet down to 139 characters, proving that bigger isn’t always better.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It may seem like a big deal now, but every company makes controversial decisions. The public is always quick to adapt, and this is likely no different. Facebook continually updates their layout and adds emoji reactions. Do we still talk about them after a week? A month? Once Twitter goes universal with this change, which I suspect it will, expect the hype and drama surrounding it to die quickly. It’s not a change anyone asked for, but it will become the standard. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t mourn the end of the 140-character limit. I love that tweeters are meant to be careful and intentional with their words. Some brevity and precision will be lost in tweets, but hopefully, Twitter sees a productive vision for this change. In the meantime, we should enjoy all the new jokes tweeters are making about all these new characters. As one user put it, “Twitter is suffering what most shows do in their later seasons by introducing a bunch of characters no one really cares about.”</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">This year has been a big one for women’s tennis. Serena Williams, arguably the greatest living tennis player, won a Grand Slam while <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/07/serena-williams-australian-open-trophy-snapchat-pregnant-baby-won-together">pregnant</a> and delivered a beautiful baby <a href="http://people.com/babies/serena-williams-alexis-ohanian-welcome-daughter/">girl</a>. Meanwhile, her rival Maria Sharapova not only returned to the circuit after fulfilling the conditions of her suspension for using banned <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/maria-sharapova-wildcard-us-open-drugs-ban-flushing-meadows-womens-draw-a7895236.html">substances</a>, but also authored a book. That book immediately threw Sharapova back under the spotlight for her ill-advised — and racialized — comments about Williams. They echoed the ubiquitous misrepresentation of black women that is all too common in the athletic community <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/15/16297562/maria-sharapova-feud-serena-williams-explained">and</a> society as a whole, and offer a telling reminder of why we need to challenge these stereotypes.</p>
<p class="p3">By Sharapova’s account, she was 12 years old when she first saw the Williams sisters play in an open practice session in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/sports/tennis/maria-sharapova-serena-williams-memoir.html?mcubz=3">Florida</a>. Despite the raging crowd, Sharapova decided not to sit in the stands. “I’d never put myself in the position of worshiping them, looking up, being a fan,” Sharapova recounts. Ultimately, her father found a nearby shed for her to watch the match without being seen. “I could watch through a kind of knothole — just me alone, in the dark, seeing the next 20 years of my life,” she recounts. But the truly problematic part of the book came later: when Sharapova refers to Williams’ presence on the court. “First of all, her physical presence is much stronger and bigger than you realize watching TV,” Sharapova writes. “She has thick arms and thick legs and is so intimidating and strong. And tall, really tall.”</p>
<p class="p3">For starters, this statement blatantly ignores the fact that, in reality, Sharapova is the taller player. She towers over Williams by five inches and is a powerful tennis player in her own right. But the statement is particularly troubling in light of the physical build and color of both athletes. The image of a “little girl” playing against a “grown woman,” as Sharapova describes their first match, brings to mind the stereotype that black women are somehow threatening, even when they are just navigating the spaces that belong to them. Instead of objectively crediting Williams for her superior skill and accomplishments, somehow Sharapova is able to idealize her own wins and make excuses for her defeats — excuses that are rooted in racialized misperceptions. It’s unfortunate that no matter how hard Williams competes, no matter how many Grand Slam titles she earns, she is constantly undervalued and critiqued for her body.</p>
<p class="p3">Here lies the difference between white excellence and black excellence: White excellence doesn’t have to battle the omnipresence of racism to gain recognition. Williams can beat Sharapova all she wants (her record stands at 19-2) but the narrative seems to stay in Sharapova’s favor. She initially received more endorsements, even though her claim to fame is regularly losing to Williams. She gets to play on center court, although she is often ranked lower than other players assigned to smaller courts. Bizarrely, she still received this center court preference in the U.S. Open last month, though she was just emerging from a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/01/sport/sharapova-controversy-center-court-wozniacki/index.html">doping</a> scandal at the time. She regularly gets the benefit of the doubt — chalking defeats up to injuries or fatigue — instead of being expected to win in spite of everything like Williams.</p>
<p class="p3">The advantages Sharapova receives — both on and off the court — as the losing member of the Williams-Sharapova rivalry is rooted in what has been historically celebrated in this country. For far too long, global standards — about athletics, beauty, marketability — have been shaped by images of white women’s bodies. In commercials, movies and magazines, there is an overrepresentation of easy-to-sell, blond-haired, green-eyed, slender white women. This imbalance tells the next generation of black women that their bodies will consistently be perceived as lacking. And it tells black female athletes that their accomplishments will always be undermined solely because of their identities. This is precisely why Serena Williams is so important to young black athletes of all genders, but especially women. She consistently debunks racial stereotypes and reminds us that credentials matter more than color.</p>
<p class="p3">In the context of these trends, Sharapova’s book isn’t just a petty attack against a tennis rival — it’s much more. Her book had many stereotypes that underrate black excellence, demean black women’s bodies and create artificial hurdles for women of color. The widespread criticism of Sharapova for her tone-deaf comments has been encouraging, but many Americans still share the same views. Clearly, we still have a long way to go when confronting biases and stereotypes specifically targeted at excellent, black women. But the overwhelming support for Williams is a start.</p>

		<title>Cardoso &#039;19: Math can save us from gerrymandering</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Near the end of the Supreme Court’s oral argument in Gill v. Whitford, a case on the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering, the court’s most junior justice, Justice Neil Gorsuch, began peppering the petitioner with questions. Where, exactly, in the Constitution was the provision that allowed the court to force states to redraw their district lines, he asked, in not so few words. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg responded with the justices’ equivalent of a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ginsburg-slaps-gorsuch">suplex</a>: “Where did one person one vote come from?” Gorsuch did not ask any more questions for the remainder of the oral arguments. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While most Americans familiar with the episode probably see it as another step in Ginsburg’s cultural apotheosis to be enjoyed briefly on Buzzfeed, her argument is one that has hounded the court for decades. If the Supreme Court has previously embraced a principle of “one person, one vote,” which it did all the way back in 1964, why is it that North Carolina has 10 Republican representatives out of 13 when only 50 percent of the population voted for congressional Republican candidates? In fact, the court recognized in the 1986 case Davis v. Bandemer, that it had constitutional authority to intervene in cases of partisan redistricting, but refused to do so without some clear metric with which to inform their decision. The court held again in the 2004 case Vieth v. Jubelirer that it simply cannot rule on gerrymandering because there is simply no fair, practical way for the court to resolve these questions. However, while there was no practical metric for measuring gerrymandering in 1986, this argument is less compelling in 2017. Why? Because of math. And in fact, the court should use math to put an end to gerrymandering once and for all.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In recent years, as gerrymandering has garnered more attention from the public and the news media, social scientists have begun to analyze partisan redistricting with more scrutiny. Many have even proposed solutions. Mathematicians like Jonathan Mattingly have developed computer software that is capable of cross-referencing thousands of maps along with relevant voting <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/the-mathematicians-who-want-to-save-democracy-1.22113">data</a>. From the data, one is able to compare actual districts and their electoral outcomes with randomized districts or independently drawn districts. The results — that many states’ district maps offer certain political parties disproportionate advantages — is unsurprising. What is important, however, is that programs like Mattingly’s and others’ (there are many, many others) offer the court a clear, scientific metric to assess whether a district has been “gerrymandered.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The question, then, is no longer whether or not the court should overturn its opinion in Vieth. It obviously should, considering the basis for its opinion is no longer valid, but whether it will do so is less clear. Voting against outlawing gerrymandering in Davis or Vieth, where evidence was less compelling and the standards for resolving gerrymandering were less obvious, could be ascribed to caution on the part of the justices. But voting against outlawing gerrymandering in Gill v. Whitford is not cautious. Rather, it is reckless, dangerous and profoundly anti-democratic.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the 2017 Electoral Integrity Project, conducted jointly by Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government and the University of Sydney, the United States ranked 55th out of 158 countries and last among Western democracies in voting fairness. This is astonishing for a country whose identity and conception of itself is so profoundly intertwined with its perceived democratic traditions. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Proponents of gerrymandering — both Democrats and Republicans — support it for nakedly partisan reasons. When asked by Justice Sonia Sotomayor what value gerrymandering has for democracy, the lawyer representing Wisconsin’s lawmakers responded by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/us/politics/gerrymandering-supreme-court-wisconsin.html">noting</a> that gerrymandering “produces values in terms of accountability that are valuable so that people know who is and who isn’t in power.” If you had trouble understanding that, don’t fret — it doesn’t make any sense. To hold that gerrymandering is important because it allows voters to know who is in power is an offensively disingenuous argument, but speaks to the partisan and anti-democratic motivations of its proponents. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The stakes of this case cannot be overstated — when the Supreme Court makes a ruling of such significance, it is very unlikely to overturn it in the near future. But with quantitative tools provided to us by social science, the Supreme Court can and should outlaw partisan gerrymandering once and for all. The health of our democracy depends on them doing so.</span></p>

		<title>Thomas &#039;21: Keeping the Brown Promise</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">“Don’t make a promise you can’t keep,” my mother would tell me growing up. I learned the power and strength of the word “promise” at a young age. Maybe that’s why Brown <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/20/u-aims-eliminate-undergrad-loans-new-brown-promise-initiative/">has decided</a> to call its new initiative to eliminate student loans for its undergraduates “Brown Promise.” Maybe President Christina Paxson P’19 and the administration deliberately chose the name of the campaign to highlight just how strong this new commitment to making Brown as affordable as possible really is. But the thing about promises is that they’re supposed to be unconditional guarantees — “Brown Promise,” given its funding structure, doesn’t exactly fit this description. On the whole, “Brown Promise” is definitely well-intentioned and has immense potential for positive impact, but it also has drawbacks that could severely hamper its long-term effectiveness if implemented.</p>
<p class="p2">Students and alums of all socioeconomic backgrounds should care about the initiative because it would immediately benefit 883 students — all students on loans who are not seniors — for the next academic school year, The Herald previously reported. The Brown experience for these students could be altered for the better, relieving them of the stress of post-graduation debt. When students are freed from the weight of loans on their shoulders, it becomes so much easier to enjoy their time at Brown doing what they love. This kind of reassurance does wonders for a student’s ability to confidently navigate their Brown experience and put their best foot forward in all of their endeavors.</p>
<p class="p2">Making Brown affordable by eliminating the burden of loans also makes Brown a more diverse campus that better attracts the best applicants. Consider this startling fact: More Brown students come from the top 1 percent than from the entire bottom 60 percent. Now put this reality in conversation with Brown’s commitment to building a diverse community. In the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, the University acknowledges that it has “traditionally failed to include fully people of all … socioeconomic classes.” To remedy this, Brown has committed itself to becoming a more diverse and inclusive institution. Brown Promise is a good way to start to fulfill this commitment, and make the University more affordable for incoming students for years to come. When financial aid packages become less of a concern, prospective students are emboldened to apply knowing that their dream come true isn’t, quite literally, coming at the expense of their family. After all, Brown becomes better by picking the students who best fit its values and reflect its commitment to inclusivity, not simply admitting those students who are most able to pay. And to be clear, increasing the proportion of low-income students does not mean poorer academic performance or job placement after graduation: A recent New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html?mcubz=0&amp;_r=0">investigation</a> found that low-income students who attend highly selective institutions fare just as well as their wealthier peers. The added diversity fostered by the initiative ultimately culminates in Brown becoming a better school — a school that removes barriers to admission that are not related to a student’s merit or potential, ensuring that Brown receives the best applicants possible. “Brown Promise” aids immensely in this effort.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>initiative is not faultless. It’s more than worth mentioning that this entire initiative is predicated on whether or not the University can raise $30 million by December. This condition runs a bit contrary to the idea of a “promise.” In fact, how can you promise the elimination of student loans from financial aid packages when the necessary funding, as of yet, is not a reality? Right now, we’re millions of dollars away from fulfilling this “promise” and it doesn’t seem fair to elaborately promote this initiative when there’s a chance that it may not even come to fruition.</p>
<p class="p2">Further,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Brown Promise” alone can’t ensure greater diversity in the Brown student body. Owen Colby ’20 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/22/colby-20-no-loans-doesnt-go-far-enough/">wrote</a> on Sept. 22 about the shortcomings of this initiative, citing antiquated admission practices as one of the major inhibitors that would keep the initiative’s goal of socioeconomic diversity from being fulfilled. The college admission process, broadly speaking, already disadvantages applicants who could make an institution more socioeconomically diverse. For example, while fee waivers are helpful, they don’t help an applicant who could only afford to take the SAT or ACT once<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and didn’t have the resources to devote as much time to test preparation as their peers. Schools like George Washington University and nearby Providence College have implemented test-optional policies that don’t make standardized testing mandatory, effectively removing an economic barrier for those applicants whose capabilities simply can’t be reflected by their results on one test. Brown should consider adopting some variation of these policies to complement “Brown Promise.”</p>
<p class="p2">It is true that “Brown Promise” doesn’t tackle the hurdles presented by the admission process and the entirety of the initiative is dependent on fundraising $30 million by December. It is also true that in spite of all of the potential good that may be in store, nothing has been guaranteed as of now; Brown has yet to make good on its promise. Any and all doubts about this initiative are valid. But I still find it worthwhile to get excited about Brown’s early efforts to reform its financial aid practices. “Brown Promise” is a crucial step in the right direction, toward not only helping students on financial aid, but also upholding the University’s commitment to creating an inclusive community that unites scholars of all needs and backgrounds.</p>

		<title>Oke &#039;20: DeVos’ title IX policy is an affront to justice</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last month, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos rescinded the Obama administration’s “Dear Colleague” letter — a document that provided incentives and clear guidelines for the proper handling of sexual assaults on college campuses. DeVos <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/07/politics/betsy-devos-education-department-title-ix/index.html">justified</a> her decision by noting that the previous system failed to protect the rights of the accused to due process and was therefore a “disservice to everyone involved.” The education secretary failed to acknowledge, however, the ramifications of policies that elevate individuals accused of sexual violence. DeVos’ flawed approach to enforcing Title IX could potentially prolong the experience for survivors of sexual assault on college campuses. DeVos’s policy puts politics and perpetrators ahead of victims, and for that it is an affront to justice.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 2011, the Office for Civil Rights issued a statement to more than 7,000 colleges in an attempt to redefine the federal government’s jurisdiction in regards to Title IX. Originally intended to combat gender-based discrimination, Title IX has been referenced in countless sexual assault cases since its enactment. Under the Obama administration, the Office for Civil Rights threatened to withdraw federal funding from any institution that did not comply with its protocols for Title IX hearings. Arguably the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/01/31/the-path-to-obamas-dear-colleague-letter/?utm_term=.44db7c74166c">most controversial</a> of these guidelines was the “preponderance of evidence” standard, which allowed colleges to use the lowest standard of proof during an investigation. Critics of federal regulation <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/06/devos-plans-title-ix-changes-in-wake-report-on-campus-denial-due-process.html">argued</a> that these rules were counterproductive and biased against the accused. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/07/politics/betsy-devos-education-department-title-ix/index.html">Many claim</a> that the “Dear Colleague” letter was “unfair toward the accused and could jeopardize their futures.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These contentions are problematic for several reasons. DeVos’ decision stems from conservative ideologies that fundamentally oppose the type of “big government” intervention exemplified by the “Dear Colleague” letter. One could argue that DeVos’ actions are a part of the current administration’s attempt to rescind any and all Obama-era policies. When it comes to justice for victims of sexual violence, there is no place for politics. Laws that are enacted to protect civil rights must be upheld permanently so that those rights can remain secure under the federal government. It is not as if the removal of de jure segregation means that we no longer have to enforce anti-discrimination policies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given the low rates of reporting, we need a system that victims can trust. A study conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics indicates that only 4.3 percent of sexual battery incidents and 12.5 percent of rape incidents are reported to officials. And contrary to DeVos’ allegations, higher numbers of guilty verdicts in these reported cases do not mean that the system is inefficient. Rather, it’s effective. And we need not raise the burden of proof so that sexual assaults are harder to prove. Across three different studies, the percentage of false reporting for sexual assaults was below 8 percent, according to the <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdf">National Sexual Violence Resource Center</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2">There is an appalling lack of accountability when it comes to sexual assaults, particularly on elite college campuses. Brown <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/02/no-immediate-changes-u-s-title-ix-policy/">has said</a> the University’s Title IX policies will not change in the nearby future, and it is my hope that Brown and other schools will stand their ground and comply with the guidelines of the “Dear Colleague” letter. At no institution should concern for people’s future careers take precedence over the individuals who have the courage to speak out after they have been harmed.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The “Dear Colleague” letter was an important first step in achieving justice for survivors of sexual violence, but the journey is far from over. In our current era of partisan government, we must be wary not to politicize key legislation. DeVos set a dangerous precedent for the future of Title IX; accused individuals can now enjoy greater legal leeway in the name of institutional efficiency. While this seems like a good idea in theory, the reality is that it undermines the victim’s right to justice. When we do not prioritize the physical and emotional safety of survivors, we run the risk of furthering their struggles and silencing the voices that truly need to be heard.</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>

		<title>Savello &#039;18: Thinking past fall recruitment</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/10/savello-18-thinking-past-fall-recruitment/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the fall semester heats up, it has become common to see students running to interviews in formal attire, practicing consulting cases in the basement of the Sciences Library and attending various recruitment events on campus. We all know what this means: Job recruiting is in full swing — and for many fields, it has started this year earlier than ever.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Over the years, companies have increasingly intensified campus recruiting efforts. Consulting, finance and technology companies begin recruiting in the fall, subjecting interested students to a rigorous and lengthy application process as early as September. And companies in other fields tend to recruit more heavily in the spring, but many release early applications in the fall, urging students to send in resumes months before they expect to begin work.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Given that cover letter writing and interview preparation can take hours upon hours each week, applying to jobs during the semester is a demanding process comparable to an extra class. This often forces students to sacrifice their senior year experience and forgo other campus opportunities. Many students understand this and see it as a worthy trade-off. But corporate recruiting — with all its financial, social and family pressures — puts too much pressure on students, who may not even find passion in these jobs anyhow.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Why is there so much pressure in the first place? For a start, some students face financial obligations. Many of us, myself included, will leave Brown strapped down with thousands of dollars of student loans, and, as a result, feel an urgency to secure a comfortable salary before the year ends.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But another, more avoidable reason for the growing obsession with corporate recruiting is status. At Ivy League schools, where the pressure to succeed is high, securing early career plans is often seen as a sign that a person is responsible and successful, while planning late is generally associated with failure or lack of ambition. There is also the perception that some jobs, such as those in consulting, finance and computer science, are more prestigious than others. While Brown’s student body places more emphasis on creativity and job satisfaction than students at other schools, this attitude is still widespread.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Finally, family pressure is a real, if unacknowledged, factor in our shifting career priorities. I speak from experience: I can’t describe how many times I have been to a family barbecue and had a relative say, “You go to Brown, so I guess you’ll be buying me dinner pretty soon.” Meanwhile, my parents relentlessly tell me, “All that tuition money better start paying off soon.” This type of commentary is stereotypical and unwarranted, but many students unfortunately face similar comments, propagating even more career anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ultimately, this harmful societal notion creates a rigid dichotomy between success and failure and places unnecessary pressure on students to enter certain fields that happen to recruit early.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It also creates unnecessary competition. Under the current system, thousands of students apply to the same few positions in coveted fields, pitting them against each other to avoid the insidious concept of “falling behind.” In some ways, this very competition pressures students further because it perpetuates the idea that jobs are scarce and will get filled early. In reality, students can find hundreds of opportunities if they expand their job search outside of the most popular industries.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Of course, it is worth acknowledging that Brown students are more likely to go into careers in nonprofits or pursue other nontraditional fields than students from many of our peer schools. At the same time, far too many students are unaware of the opportunities that lie outside popular career paths. Jobs in communications and media, for example, recruit more heavily in the spring or hire on a rolling basis, yet many students don’t realize this.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And this is precisely where Brown can step in. Though promoting fall recruitment for those who are genuinely interested in these careers is important, Brown should also work toward building more awareness about alternative jobs and recruiting cycles. CareerLAB has dedicated considerable attention to promoting nonprofit careers, but more can be done to shed light on other sectors and career paths. At the end of the day, it’s crucial that students dedicate their time toward opportunities that bring them fulfillment, rather than pursuing only a few select fields based on external pressure and imperfect information.</span></p>

		<title>Colby ’20: It’s time for Brown to go test-optional</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown’s early decision application deadline is fast approaching, with many applicants rushing to submit their SAT and ACT scores. These students are applying in the shadow of Brown Promise, the University’s multi-billion dollar effort to promote diversity and access to a Brown education. However, meaningful improvements to the diversity of Brown’s student body can’t happen with extra funding for financial aid alone. That is, as I and my fellow columnists Quentin <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/09/thomas-21-keeping-brown-promise/">Thomas</a> ’21 and Lena <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/17/renshaw-20-end-legacy-admissions-brown/">Renshaw</a> ’20 have pointed out in the past few weeks, the complicated mission of building a more diverse Brown requires an integrated approach. As such, any serious program of reform must address the systemic inequities faced both by applicants and current students, who must deal with student loans after graduation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Right now, Brown’s continued use of regressive admissions practices, like legacy admissions, inadvertently undercuts its stated goals of diversity. But another regressive practice worth scrutinizing that hasn’t received as much attention is Brown’s use of standardized test scores to evaluate applicants. Standardized tests have long been a staple of Brown’s admissions process; the University suggests applicants take not only the SAT or ACT but also two additional SAT Subject Tests. These standardized exams subvert Brown’s goals of socioeconomic, racial and intellectual diversity on campus, in part by imposing undue burdens on low-income applicants. As such, Brown should seriously reevaluate its use of standardized tests — especially as it pushes to bolster its accessibility to underrepresented students — and go test-optional. The University has already taken some steps to remedy this. For the Class of 2021, applicants <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/10/21/test-essay-scores-optional-for-class-of-2021-onwards/">did not need</a> to submit the essay portion of the SAT or ACT. Measures like these can help low-income students, but Brown needs to do more.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In recent years, the University has prioritized diversity in its admissions policies and its development of new programs to help students acclimate to campus life. The administration has recognized that diversity is important for countless reasons — including the fact that diversity enhances the Brown experience by bringing people from different backgrounds together to collaborate and exchange knowledge. Thus far, Brown has devoted more resources to minorities, low-income and first generation students: Last fall, the University opened the First-Generation and Low-Income Student Center in the Sciences <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/19/first-gen-low-income-student-center-unveiled/">Library</a>, and last spring, it moved to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/21/u-waives-application-fee-low-income-students/">waive</a> application fees for low-income students. Still, these actions cannot fully help Brown compensate for its discriminatory past and achieve its long-term diversity goals so long as the University employs standardized testing in admissions. As Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, told the Herald in 2012, “I don’t think (need-blind admission does) any good. Because in the end, it’s the distribution of test scores. You can go need-blind, but if everyone’s got a 1200 SAT, you’re not going to get any low-income <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/04/23/how-diverse-are-we/">kids</a>.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As I’ve written about before, standardized tests unfairly advantage privileged applicants who have the means to afford test preparation tutors and courses. According to a 2016 Herald poll, 42.3 percent of students with no financial aid used professional test tutors, compared to only 14.3 percent of students receiving some grants, and 4 percent of students receiving full aid. Multiple studies have concluded that test preparation has a positive effect on standardized test outcomes. One case study of 21 students compared their performance before and after test preparation and saw 12 students earn “SAT-Math scores that were 70 or more points higher… four increased their scores by 100-120 points, and one jumped a whopping 160 points.” But these score improvements are, by and large, concentrated among those who can afford expensive test preparation. SAT preparation materials generally are beyond the reach of poor families: practice books are expensive, Kaplan’s most popular SAT Prep Course costs $899 and private tutoring can easily cost thousands of dollars. The discriminatory effects of standardized tests — which essentially reward wealthier students at the expense of others — may provide one explanation for why over 19 percent of Brown students come from the top 1 percent of the income scale, while only 18.2 percent come from the bottom 60 percent of the income scale.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It has been argued that without standardized tests, there is no broad, objective metric that admissions officers can use to easily compare students. This notion ignores the plethora of evidence that already proves that standardized test scores are not an objective metric. Universities that have decreased the weight they place on applicants’ test scores, like Wesleyan University, have found that standardized tests are a poor indicator of college academic success, and that they are better able to attract a “more racially and socio-economically diverse pool of candidates.” It is also worth pushing back against the idea that standardized tests meaningfully measure applicants’ abilities. The use of test scores places a normative value on the ability to test well, and thus the rote analytical skills that come with standardized test-taking. Test scores reward just one type of intelligence, while neglecting all other ways of thinking — which may, in the long run, hinder the diversity of thought and creativity on campus. Moreover, a gradual shift to a test-optional admissions policy does not mean Brown must abolish the use of tests entirely; they may still prove useful when comparing students from similar academic, racial, geographic and economic backgrounds. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many universities have already taken note of the inherently discriminatory nature of the SAT and vowed to apply the test in more equitable ways. Pitzer College, Bowdoin College and Wesleyan all have similar acceptance rates to Brown and are all test-optional. The use of standardized tests does not need to be the norm — there are already over 950 accredited colleges and universities that employ “test optional,” “test flexible” policies or otherwise de-emphasize the importance of standardized test scores. These reforms would certainly align with the goals of the University’s BrownTogether and Brown Promise campaigns, which aim to promote a more diverse student body. Ultimately, if Brown really cares about diversity of class, race and thought on campus, it ought to become test-optional as part of a more integrated approach to equity in admissions. </span></p>

		<title>Vilsan &#039;19: How tech undermines our education</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s no secret that, in this current age of rapid technological progress, the attention spans of young people are taking a hit. We check our phones every five minutes, prefer our news in the form of 140-characters and never dare to venture past the second page of a Google search. We’ve grown used to finding very specific pieces of information in a short amount of time. Unlike previous generations, few of us have had to sift through old books in a library for a research project or can remember the last time we read a book cover-to-cover. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With new and exciting job prospects and online academic resources, college students in particular are most aware of the many benefits that technology has brought them. But the convenience and access to knowledge made possible by our gadgets have come with an unexpected cost: our declining ability to focus on a single task for a prolonged period of time. I must admit, maybe our parents were onto something whenever they told us about their time in school, free of the technological distractions we’re faced with today. Shorter attention spans, induced by our technological addictions, can actually harm our long-term well-being by compromising the liberal arts education that we’re all at Brown to receive. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A new study from Microsoft warns that the average human today boasts the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/opinion/the-eight-second-attention-span.html">attention</a> span of a goldfish: a crisp eight seconds. Those multiple open tabs have finally caught up to us, and we’re now finding it difficult to filter out unnecessary distractions and remain focused on the task at hand. We want everything right here and right now, but things outside of the technological realm — like our educations — don’t work that way. A quick glimpse around a lecture hall will bring you face-to-face with numerous Facebook pages and Buzzfeed articles as opposed to the lecture notes professors are hoping their students are typing. Distraction during a lecture is inevitable, and checking on one of your open tabs mid-lecture can seem harmless. But on a practical level, those multiple tabs are evidence that our ever-shrinking attention spans can seriously hurt our ability to absorb information from non-digital sources, from something as elementary as a regular lecture. That’s a considerable waste of our Ivy League education — and our minds.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With their short attention spans, students accustomed to getting their answers through a Google search in between lecture slides are also making it harder for themselves to be patient with their academic challenges. What we dismissively label as “distractions” are signals of a deteriorating ability to do the independent thinking expected of serious students and scholars. Indeed, our shorter attention spans are harming our potential to fully achieve the goal of a liberal arts education: sustained engagement with material that may initially be complicated and hard to understand. According to some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/education/technology-is-changing-how-students-learn-teachers-say.html">educators</a>, our over-reliance on quick solutions and quick transitions between tabs is hampering our ability to stick with compelling material long enough to become inspired and develop original ideas. At Brown, we have some of the world’s foremost intellectual minds and numerous academic resources within our reach. It would simply be a pity to let ourselves lose our creativity and the true power of our liberal arts education to the convenience of rote internet searches.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Facing an increasing number of computer screens in their classrooms, teachers and professors across the world often feel compelled to integrate high-tech tools into their lesson plans. This accomodation of young people’s technological habits may have an adverse effect on their ability to engage with the material. Many teachers who employ digital tools in the classroom note that the “Wikipedia Problem” — students prefer to search for an answer online instead of deriving it themselves — is becoming more and more prevalent in their schools as the proliferation of technology continues. The digitization of the classroom may be playing a role in conditioning students to expect quick solutions for their problems instead of disciplining them to engage with new and creative ideas. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I don’t know what the answer to our shrinking attention spans is, and it isn’t clear how we can best salvage our liberal arts education in an increasingly tech-driven world. But I know that throwing more media into a classroom isn’t going to solve the problem. Perhaps we ought to relearn the values instilled in previous generations and approach the latest technological fads with a dose of skepticism. At college, we shouldn’t be allowed or encouraged to retreat to the safety of our devices. Rather we should be learning how to remain tenacious and committed in the face of academic difficulties.</span></p>

		<title>Okin ’19: Chill culture isn’t cool</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/12/okin-19-chill-culture-isnt-cool/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What creature tends to seek a mate in the winter, welcomes any offering of free carbs and has mastered appearing calm on the surface while actually struggling to keep up? If you guessed a duck, you are correct. If you guessed a Brown student, you are also correct.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to the logic of the “Duck Syndrome,” which was coined at Stanford but exists in a number of colleges, many of us students take pride in appearing to smoothly glide on the surface. Not studying for a test or sleeping through class, for example, are too often seen as badges of honor. But like ducks, we are actually propelled through our weeks on College Hill by a frenzied paddling underneath the water. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I don’t expect this to be true for everyone — some people are naturally calm, cool and collected. As a fairly uptight person myself, I always try to surround myself with these types of individuals. For those of us who relate to that furious paddling in some form (whether we choose to conceal it below the surface or not), we are probably also aware of what, besides the water, we are really clashing against: a culture of chill. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, anyone who writes an article about chill has none to speak of. But here’s the thing: Chill as a desirable trait is bogus. In fact, the current social obsession with obtaining chill is not only counterproductive, but also both arbitrary and misguided. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This manifestation of “Duck Syndrome” is not limited to academics — it is pervasive in almost all aspects of student life. In a 2015 article outlining the emergence of this obsession with chill, writer Alana Massey comments on the pervasiveness of the social phenomenon in perhaps its most prevalent realm: our romantic lives. Massey points out that we find ourselves competing in the “Blasé Olympics,” where more points are awarded to appearing disinterested than to any display of genuine emotion. As a consistent perpetrator of both the “Double Text” and the “Over Analysis,” I can attest to the moments of internal conflict where pursuing the cooler approach feels more socially acceptable than going with my natural instinct and responding immediately with excessive emojis. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet whenever I participate in this ritual, I invariably find myself in the pits of frustration. Why am I trying so hard to dismiss my naturally eager nature to promote a false appearance of “I literally don’t care?” In fact, pursuing this supposedly calming thing is actually the source of many freakouts. In contrast to what one may expect, the time and energy spent pursuing chill often has the reverse effect. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The premium we place on being chill is also artificial, and its only real impact is to call out people who aren’t. Chill should be used to describe the personalities of the calmer individuals among us and nothing else. Because rather than being some objective to reach, it is merely a neutral personality trait that we’ve placed on a pedestal. Unlike being kind, considerate or friendly,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>being chill does not provide any inherent social benefit. Like owning a pet or being tall, possessing the chill factor is arbitrary. Indeed, the fact that being chill has morphed into a social necessity only excludes others, particularly those who are naturally less chill.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> So here’s my suggestion: Let’s stop placing value in always appearing aloof. Those who are suffering from the burden of chill culture must constantly check their actions to conform to this culture. While maintaining a facade of coolness can seem fulfilling, the energy it takes to achieve this chill leads to regret and frustration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In reality, ducks have no chill. Their webbed feet don’t hold any nerves. This results in an inability to feel how cold the water actually is. Yet we students feel the stress of studying or<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the hazards of hook-up culture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But we can and should remove the burden of trying to act chill. Rather than stressing out over pretending to be someone we’re not, we should recognize that the deference we give to being chill is artificial and inappropriate. Instead, let’s recognize that chill is a neutral personality trait. </span></p>

		<title>Klein &#039;19: Draft drama a welcome development for NBA All-Star Game</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The NBA announced a total overhaul of the perrenially-disappointing All-Star Game last week;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>two teams, drafted by captains, will play the in game, instead of the customary Eastern Conference and Western Conference teams. The players in the draft pool will be the 24 selected for the All-Star Game via last year’s process — 12 from each conference, 10 starters selected by vote and 14 chosen by coaches. Additionally, proceeds from the game will now be donated to charities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reaction to the dramatic changes was mixed. The players who negotiated the move spoke out in praise. “I’m thrilled with what the players and the league have done to improve the All-Star Game, which has been a priority for all of us,” said National Basketball Players Association President and Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul. Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James said “We had to do something. … The All-Star Game has been pretty bad the last couple years just from a competition standpoint.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There was still some criticism leveled at the changes. The idea of team captains was found to be problematic — with the potential to cause unnecessary turmoil. Cavaliers guard J.R. Smith hoped that the league would not televise the draft process, saying also about the draft: “That’s a hard situation to put guys in. … I don’t think they really thought that thing through all the way.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But at the end of the day, regardless of the players’ potentially hurt feelings, changes needed to be made to the All-Star Game. The new format is a massive improvement in every way, and there will probably be further tweaks made over the next couple of years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The All-Star Game has been in decline for over a decade. The games in the early 2000s, while obviously not as competitive as a meaningful NBA game, were spirited affairs. Players took pride in representing their respective conferences and the closing minutes were intense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 2001 All-Star Game ended in a thrilling 111-110 Eastern Conference victory. Trailing 21 points with only nine minutes remaining, the East mounted a stunning comeback to win. Guard Stephon Marbury hit the game-winning shot with 28 seconds remaining.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The 2003 contest, considered by many to be the greatest iteration of the game, was a 155-145 double-overtime Western Conference win. Michael Jordan sunk a shot with 4.8 seconds remaining in the first overtime to give the East a 138-136 advantage, but Kobe Bryant sunk two free throws after being fouled on a three pointer, tying the affair back up. The West took control in the second overtime and came away victorious.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2017’s version of the “competiton” was a 192-182 snooze. While one would assume that a game with such a high score would be a sight worth seeing, the points came so easily that there was little reason to watch. Players chucked up threes and lounged around the court, converting on a few open dunks. There was no defense to be seen whatsoever. Stephen Curry actually laid down on the floor instead of guarding a fast break opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The difference between past and present is clear. The game precipitously worsened in quality and grew more boring with each new year. There is simply no incentive for players to risk injury in a completely meaningless game.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The new format provides the necessary motivation and for good causes. While it is not exactly clear yet what the charity component entails, we know for sure that each team will play for a Los Angeles-based charity, which should encourage players to actually make an effort. And of course, the more money that goes to those who need it, the better.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Motivation will come too from the new All-Star Game draft. Though some players may worry about hurt feelings, the All-Star Game is supposed to be entertaining, and the potential drama a draft could create could capture everyone’s attention. The Kevin Durant-Russell Westbrook and LeBron James-Kyrie Irving feuds will generate most of the headlines, but there will be fun tension no matter what the teams are. Whoever is picked last will have a giant chip on his shoulder, and nothing motivates athletes like disrespect.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">New rivalries can form as well. Maybe LeBron James passes on taking Giannis Antetokounmpo for his buddy Carmelo Anthony. Or maybe Stephen Curry picks teammate Klay Thompson instead of James Harden. What if someone passes on a teammate to take a better player? The possibilities are endless.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The All-Star Game, with its new format, has become a reality television version of the NBA, which will be a lot more thrilling to watch than NBA players lackadaisically jogging. Dunks and three-pointers are fun when they occur in a competition. A Stephen Curry three-pointer from almost half court against the Oklahoma City Thunder? Awesome. A Stephen Curry three-pointer with no one near him as LeBron James half-heartedly walks in his direction? Less awesome.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No matter what happens next February, at the very least, the All-Star Game coverage is now worth watching. Change has been a long time coming and the format will only get better in the future as the league finetunes the game, learning what worked and what did not. The NBA has once again proven its admirable ability to adapt.</span></p>

		<title>Grigo &#039;18: Is Clayton Kershaw due for a peak playoff performance?</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/13/grigo-18-clayton-kershaw-due-peak-playoff-performance/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following his outing last Friday against the Arizona Diamondbacks — a six-and-a-third-inning effort in which he surrendered four earned runs on four solo homers — Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw is now 15 starts and 95 and-a-third innings into his playoff career. That’s about a half-season’s worth of pitching, a sample large enough to warrant entertaining the possibility that Kershaw’s pedestrian playoff performance might be due to something other than random variation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kershaw owns a 4.63 earned run average in the postseason, a mark nearly double his career regular season 2.36 ERA. While fewer than 100 innings aren’t sufficient for ERA to stabilize near a pitcher’s true talent level, consider this: Since the end of his rookie season in 2008, Kershaw has had just two halves of seasons — the first halves of 2011 and 2009 — where his ERA has risen above 3.00.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The main cause of Kershaw’s playoff struggles has been his propensity to give up the long ball. He’s allowed more than twice as many home runs per nine innings in October as in the regular season. This could be connected to his poor playoff strand rate, the percentage of batters who reach base that fail to score, which sits 15.1 percentage points below his career regular season rate. It is tempting to blame Kershaw’s inability to keep teams in the yard on his inflated home run per fly ball percentage, as balls lifted in the air against him in the postseason have left for home runs nearly twice as often than over the rest of his career. HR/FB percent is notoriously volatile, and it could very well be the case that Kershaw has simply been a victim of the randomness of baseball.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Still, there are real concerns to be had about Kershaw’s playoff mediocrity. Hitters have popped more balls into the air with more authority against Kershaw in the postseason: Per Baseball Savant, batters have recorded an average launch angle 7.1 degrees higher off him in the playoffs with an average exit velocity 3.7 mph faster. Those numbers go a long way toward explaining Kershaw’s playoff HR/9 numbers, but it’s unclear how much of the uptick in opposing batters’ quality of contact is noise and how much can be attributed to something unique about the postseason.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The issue doesn’t seem to be Kershaw wearing down late in the season, nor does it seem to stem from the amount of starts he has made on short rest in the playoffs. Kershaw’s average fastball velocity has actually risen .6 mph to an average of 94.4 mph in October, per Baseball Savant. And he’s pitched to the tune of a 3.15 ERA in the four starts he’s made on three days rest following a previous start — down a run and a half from his overall postseason ERA.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One area where Kershaw has faltered in October, though, is getting lefties out. Left-handed batters have posted a .243 weighted on-base average against Kershaw over his career during the regular season, but in the postseason, that number has spiked to .339, which is above the league average. Most of the damage has come off fastballs: Lefties are hitting .333 with a .704 slugging percentage against Kershaw’s four-seamer in the playoffs compared to just .219 and .380 in the regular season.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The fastballs left-handed hitters have punished Kershaw on generally weren’t well executed pitches — except for the two in the top left corner in the graphic, batters have simply taken advantage of Kershaw catching the middle of the plate. Yet comparing Kershaw’s regular season fastball location heatmap to his postseason heatmap on Brooks Baseball, there exists little discernible difference. Kershaw makes mistakes in the regular season, too, they’re just getting ripped more often come October.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some of that might be dumb luck, but it appears that lefties have altered their approach against him in the playoffs. Over his regular season career, left-handed batters have swung at Kershaw fastballs located over the plate and in the middle horizontal third just 74.1 percent of the time, per data from Brooks Baseball. In the postseason, they’re offering at fastballs in that same location 85.96 percent of the time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kershaw has thrown too few playoff innings to make a definitive judgement about his effectiveness in October, and he’s certainly due for some regression to the mean in his home run prevention going forward. But if lefties really are, for whatever reason, making the conscious decision to jump on more of his fastballs in the playoffs, Kershaw may have to adapt if he wants to replicate his regular season success throughout the postseason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Dodgers are once again just four wins away from a National League pennant with game one of the National League Championship Series one day away. And given that the franchise’s current World Series championship drought dates back to 1988, the urgency is clear: Los Angeles needs their ace starting tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A little batted ball luck wouldn’t hurt, either.</span></p>

		<title>Campanelli &#039;18: The change our campus needs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given Attorney General Jeff Session’s address at Georgetown Law School about protecting freedom of speech and the controversy surrounding Free Speech Week at the University of California at Berkeley, the issue of free speech on college campuses has once again taken center stage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These debates have also unfolded here at Brown. We, as members of the Brown community, have much to be proud of, but we are not without our faults. Our campus’ lack of diversity of thought is arguably one of the most concerning. By failing to have diversity of political ideologies represented in our faculty and guest lecturers, we cultivate a culture of hostility toward opposing beliefs and create a self-reinforcing echo chamber that hinders productive dialogue and progress. We need to actively fight to bring more diverse speakers, guests and faculty to our campus so that we can promote meaningful conversation and help move our campus and country forward.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">College campuses across the country are battling with this predicament. In these battles over who should be welcomed on campus, and who should be given a platform, the cries for censorship seem to be prevailing. College campuses, which are designed to be bastions of debate and open mindedness, are becoming places intolerant of free and respectful discourse. For example, this past week students at the College of William and Mary shouted down Claire Guthrie Gastañaga, executive director of the Virginia office of the American Civil Liberties Union, because they did not like that the ACLU had defended the First Amendment rights of the neo-Nazi demonstrators in Charlottesville. At Wesleyan University, the student government revoked its funding for their campus newspaper in 2016 because it published an op-ed that did not align with many students’ political beliefs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We have seen this sort of censorship play out on our campus, too, as our own classmates shouted down New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly in 2014. To disagree with the mainstream liberal ideology is now a capital offense, punishable by denying these individuals an opportunity to explain their ideas. It’s true that some of the policies that Kelly championed as commissioner — such as stop-and-frisk — targeted minorities. But these tactics are best critiqued through critical discussion and analysis, not erasure. Our campus also often invites more liberal than conservative figures. This year, the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs established a lecture series with Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez ’83 P’18 without inviting any of his conservative counterparts. This reflects an ideological unwillingness on the part of the administration and the student body to encounter different perspectives. We here at Brown need to do everything in our power to break this trend.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bringing more politically diverse speakers to campus will be immensely beneficial for the University and the student body. Of course, this does not mean that we should bring in inflammatory individuals who aim to insult and make fun of the student body; instead, we should invite leading conservative thinkers who come with the goal of teaching and learning. We need to reach out to highly credentialed and well-respected thinkers across the political spectrum, like Gov. Charlie Baker, Gov. John Kasich, Victor Davis Hanson and Yuval Levin. Inviting speakers with unpopular views to campus can help students define their core beliefs through reason, not dogma, and enable them to defend those beliefs intellectually. Hosting discussions with conservative leaders through panel events, speaking opportunities, workshops and other forums —in which students are also given an opportunity to participate — would expose students to new ideas, while allowing them to criticize what they disagree with. These small initiatives would ultimately be a chance for students to grow, understand competing ideas and better realize the spirit of a Brown education. After all, Brown states that its mission is to serve the world by “communicating and preserving knowledge and understanding in a spirit of free inquiry, and by educating and preparing students to discharge the offices of life with usefulness and reputation.” Failing to expose students to beliefs and ideologies held by millions across the country undermines the University’s commitment to free inquiry and does not prepare Brown graduates to face the reality of political life. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For a liberal democratic society to flourish, its citizens must be willing and eager to truly learn and comprehend other points of view. Shouting down and name-calling only further widen the gap between individuals in our country. As students at Brown, do we want to reflect the ineptitude and gridlock that frustrate us? No. We ought to be brave enough to push forward and engage in the conversations that, while difficult, are necessary for political change. I am not advocating for students to sit and accept whatever a speaker has to say. Rather, let us first hear the different thoughts and perspectives that speakers bring with them and then challenge them. It is only after listening and attempting to comprehend opposing views that we begin a serious and meaningful dialogue. This is the change our nation needs, and it is the change we need as a campus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I understand that it is not the responsibility of students who face systemic injustice to combat that injustice in their day-to-day lives. I understand that dealing with opposing viewpoints can be uncomfortable, and can even hurt. I understand that it is not easy, for example, to watch a white police commissioner talk about why his department uses stop-and-frisk policing techniques, which disproportionately target black people. But political engagement and political change are not easy or comfortable — they are burdensome missions, and we best advance these missions by hearing out the ideas we find reprehensible and rebutting them in a respectful, rigorous and articulate way. If we fail to do this, we will continue to isolate our University and will relegate our own political ideas to the sidelines because we failed to give any credence or respect to the ideas of others. Working with those you disagree with is difficult, but it is a difficult path that we must walk down to achieve the social change that most Brown students desire. Remaining an echo chamber won’t advance our goals, but by engaging with political diversity we can expand our horizons and broaden our reach.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From New <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/italian-americans-proudly-celebrate-columbus-day-parade-50378539">York</a> to <a href="http://www.kenoshanews.com/news/local/italian-community-celebrates-heritage-at-columbus-day-event/article_b9a06c2d-883f-5d18-b91f-a92efeed7cd8.html">Kenosha</a>, people came together on Columbus Day to honor their Italian-American heritage. In a Facebook group dedicated to the Italian-American roots of Massachusetts’ Merrimack Valley, where I am from, people discussed going to their local Sons of Italy lodges to celebrate. Despite my misleadingly Irish surname, three sets of my great-grandparents immigrated to the United States from Italy (specifically Naples and Sicily, to establish my regional ties). I grew up eating cannoli, crispelli and crusty Italian bread. On Labor Day weekends, I would often go to a local feast for three Italian saints. I feel connected to my ancestors’ homeland. And as an Italian-American, I am troubled that Columbus Day is being interpreted as a celebration of our culture. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Christopher Columbus is not a figure around whom Italian-Americans should rally, and Columbus Day should not be used to celebrate our heritage. We should not be heroizing a man responsible for the enslavement and murder of countless indigenous peoples. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are many arguments already written about how Columbus Day celebrates colonialism and the oppression of the peoples who first settled the Americas. I have nothing novel to contribute to the general discussion of why Indigenous Peoples’ Day would be a more appropriate celebration. Instead, I am focused on why Italian-Americans should disentangle ourselves from Columbus Day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The major argument in favor of Columbus Day being a day for celebrating Italian-American heritage comes from its roots as a holiday. It was first celebrated in 1892, in the midst of the largest <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/14/232120128/how-columbus-sailed-into-u-s-history-thanks-to-italians">period</a> of Italian immigration to the United States. As recent immigrants, Italians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries faced xenophobia, as exemplified in the high-profile Sacco and Vanzetti executions. Thus, Columbus became a figure around which newly-arrived Italians could rally to celebrate their connection with their new country and counter the discrimination they faced as immigrants. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is understandable why Columbus held such importance to early Italian-Americans: Though Columbus never set foot in North America, nor did he have any conception of an Italian-American identity, he was the best-known person of Italian heritage to have made a significant contribution to American history. For recent immigrants, his image tied together two disparate cultures.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recalling that history of anti-Italian bias in America allows us to recognize the discrimination that has long been leveled against immigrants. Yet, recognition of the troubles that Italian-Americans faced in the past should be tempered with the acknowledgment that those troubles are no longer with us today. White Italian-Americans receive the same benefits from their race as do Americans of Anglo-Saxon descent. And, critically, Italian-Americans benefit as much as anyone else from the colonization that Columbus ushered in. We all — and to be explicitly clear, I am including myself in this statement — live on land that was stolen from its original inhabitants. That we share an ethnicity with the first thief is not something to be proud of. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The reasons behind Columbus’ importance as a figurehead are logical. But understanding why our ancestors acted in certain ways does not mean that we have to value the same things that they did. Columbus has increasingly been recognized for his violence toward indigenous peoples, a fact that has historically been omitted in the conversations that Italian-Americans have held about him. We can do better than our progenitors. We can find sources of pride that do not come with brutal violence attached to them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And indeed, Italian-Americans have plenty of cultural points of pride that have nothing to do with Columbus. I referenced going to an Italian feast when I was younger. The Feast of the Three Saints <a href="http://www.threesaintsinc.org/about-us.php">honors</a> three martyred Sicilian brothers. Though the feast is inarguably a religious festival, it functions more broadly as a celebration of the Italian immigrant heritage of the city in which it is held. The crafts, the food and even coming together to cheer on the procession of the saints offers as much to religious Italian-Americans as it does to the more secular among us, including myself. Other feasts take place in other historically Italian neighborhoods, such as the Fisherman’s <a href="http://www.fishermansfeast.com/about.html">Feast</a>, held yearly in Boston’s North End. And there are now innumerable important Italian-Americans, ranging from authors to scientists to politicians, for us to celebrate. Why waste time defending a murderer when we could be uplifting lesser-known figures?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this year’s Columbus Day Parade in New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/italian-americans-proudly-celebrate-columbus-day-parade-50378539">said</a>, “You can debate the historical figure of Christopher Columbus, but you can’t debate the contribution of Italian-Americans to this country. That is beyond question.” What de Blasio fails to recognize is that Columbus does not have to represent those contributions. As long as he does, our heritage will be tied to the suffering that indigenous peoples endured, and continue to experience, at the hands of European settlers. I cannot speak for de Blasio, but I personally find nothing to be proud of there.</span></p>

		<title>Friedman &#039;19: Rethinking the millenial travel bug</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems as if everyone is into traveling these days. Let me rephrase that: Millennials are into traveling. In 2016, 80 percent of millennials surveyed by the American Society of Travel Agents reported taking a leisure vacation that year. And it’s not just the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/travel/2017/05/03/what-millennial-travelers-want-new-study-finds-out/mRCbCdZzhtOyFVU7jN7sVM/story.html">statistics</a> — my Instagram tells me the same thing. I can pretty much count on seeing photos of a friend’s travel experience every time I open the phone app. This happens so often that I can even tell you which experiences are in vogue at the moment — trips to Block Island, on-a-whim vacations to Yosemite National Park and, if you’re lucky and can afford it, elephant-back excursions in Thailand, among others. But as traveling increases in popularity, our reasons for traveling are becoming increasingly insincere.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are obvious reasons for the current travel boom — notably technology, which has made traveling significantly cheaper and easier in recent years. With the advent of Airbnb, the scope of accommodations has expanded to include not only hotels and hostels, but also local apartments. Meanwhile, airfares <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/how-airline-ticket-prices-fell-50-in-30-years-and-why-nobody-noticed/273506/">fell</a> by about 50 percent between 1979 and 2011.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More abstractly, the Great Recession has evaporated any trust that millennials previously maintained in the value of job loyalty and the idea of saving for retirement. Many of us see travel largely as a way to take a break from an unpredictable job market (or internship market, in the case of Brown students) in the hope of finding inspiration in unfamiliar settings, should we be so lucky to afford travel in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But there are also more self-serving reasons for travel — namely our desire to publicize it. This is another manifestation of a desperate rat-race to appear cultured and attractive; it seems that everyone on Tinder advertises their love of traveling. If you traveled somewhere but didn’t take photos, did you even go? For most intents and purposes, the answer is no. It seems that in travel, bragging rights are the only thing that matters. Usually I can’t tell whether my friends travel because they want to or because they feel that they are supposed to. As with food, I would argue that travel is a medium through which young people enjoy bougie displays of one-upmanship via photography. But when I’m looking at my Instagram feed, I feel as if I am being compelled by the trying-too-hard filters and captions to see these photos as some sort of genuine self-expression. I have a hard time buying this. It seems that as interest in travel becomes more widespread, it becomes less authentic largely due to the ubiquitous social media popularity contest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And I’m not just saying this: The Instagram trend is already having tangible effects on tourism economies across the world. For example, a town in New Zealand invited and hired Instagram <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/travel-interests/arts-and-culture/how-instagram-is-changing-travel/">influencers</a> — “social media trendsetters with large followings” — in 2015 and experienced a 14 percent increase in tourism within a year. I have a hard time believing that these newfound visitors really cared about visiting Wanaka, New Zealand in the first place; they simply wanted to appear trendy. It seems that if a destination shows up on your “Explore” feed on Instagram, it will automatically show up in your Expedia itinerary.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though these superficial reasons for travel seem benign, they matter. Our motives are what ultimately separate meaningful travel from potentially exploitative tourism — and yes, there is a difference between the two. Just look at Puerto Rico, rendered economically incapable of dealing with the aftermath of two hurricanes. Yet I know many Brown students who traveled there last spring because airfares were cheap and the drinking age is 18. And then there is the extreme example of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico right now: Drug-related killings, administered by the Jalisco cartel, occur blocks away from beach-fronting, all-expenses-paid resorts and their upper-class denizens. The two worlds are separate and unequal, physically and financially. Both Puerto Rico and Cabo are examples of indifferent traveling to destinations with long-standing problems and no long-term solutions. Boycotting these locations isn’t necessarily an option — it could do more harm than good to local economies, and arguably both issues stem from government-mismanagement more so than from exploitative tourism — but it is worth keeping the consequences of our travel in mind.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although travel has become an intractable part of my generation’s thinking — I would even go so far as to say that it represents the new American dream — what’s missing from this equation is any meaningful concern on the part of American visitors for their destination’s long-term well-being. This not only applies to international destinations, but also domestic ones, as Trump orders the Department of the Interior to “review all designations of national monuments greater than 100,000 acres created since 1996,” perhaps to make room for more energy-related <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/28/525883061/photos-see-the-sweeping-american-landscapes-under-review-by-trump">endeavors</a>. While the lack of current discussion about this review might be another example of the Trump administration’s ability to sweep policy changes under the rug, the public’s inattention to this particular issue also makes a statement about American attitudes toward the destinations we frequent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I know that we can’t change the fact that millennial wanderlust is here to stay. But as we purchase Spring Break tickets and plan trips during the summer, we can change the way we view travel from a blithe consumption of the destination’s aesthetics (for Instagram) to a genuine engagement with its history, people and the current state of its political affairs. The travel trend is here to stay, but that doesn’t mean that we have to continue traveling indifferently and ignorantly.</span></p>

So when I came to Providence to attend Brown, it didn’t bother me that the city had no light rail or subways. But what the city and state lack in rail transport, they make up for in an army of buses.</p>
<p class="p2">Almost everyone has heard the announcement, “CAUTION: BUS IS TURNING,” like clockwork from the Thayer Street tunnel that serves as our connection to the rest of Providence. Every day, I see Brown staff members and other local residents line up for the buses that crisscross the city. These vehicles, plastered with hospital advertisements and smiles, transport the lifeblood of the University on a daily basis. The one group I wish I saw more of on the buses, however, is Brown students.</p>
<p class="p2">It’s not like cost is an issue here. For almost a decade, Brown has paid all bus fees for students who use their student IDs on the Rhode Island Public Transportation <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2008/05/14/ripta-free-ride-program-a-big-hit-so-far/">Authority</a>. This in itself gives Brown students an advantage: I can assure you that students at Columbia and New York University don’t get free rides on New York City public <a href="http://columbiaspectator.com/2004/03/08/why-dont-we-get-student-discounts-metrocards/,">transportation</a>. Not to mention, we also have access to the Brown onCall shuttle service, which only increases our options for safe, free transportation to and from campus.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet today, many students who can afford to hail an Uber or Lyft would rather pay inordinate amounts in surge pricing than set foot into public transportation. I can understand relying on rideshares when traveling to underserviced areas, while under time constraints or during late night runs. But when I see sheer laziness or an aversion to public transportation (which is, again, free for students) among my peers? That amazes me in its stupidity. It also reveals a lot about us as a student body and how we interact with the greater Providence community — or, more specifically, how we fail to engage with it at any deep level.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why is there an ingrained prejudice against public transportation in certain places? For a start, we are more inclined to support public transportation when we don’t use it ourselves. As one Onion article hilariously <a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/report-98-percent-of-us-commuters-favor-public-tra-1434">spoofs</a>, “98 Percent of U.S. Commuters Favor Public Transportation For Others.” CityLab <a href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2014/09/if-so-many-people-support-mass-transit-why-do-so-few-ride/380570/">reports</a> that people who don’t travel on public transportation often believe it leads to indirect benefits for their communities, including creating less traffic overall. But these same respondents are not inclined to ever use it themselves, citing a range of different excuses.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Others argue that when public transportation improves, it solely helps those at the top of the socioeconomic food chain. And as Brown students who attend one of the wealthiest institutions in the state, we are definitely at the top. It’s the reason why there is nearly nonstop bus service between Eastside Marketplace and campus, while late-night Taco Bell and Pizza Hut workers can wait up to an hour in Kennedy Plaza for the same service. These are people that could use our RIPTA privileges a lot more than we do.</p>
<p class="p2">I’ve seen this apathy with my own eyes. There are students who humble-brag about helping Rhode Island’s neediest for their volunteer positions, but would rather pay out of their own pocket for roundtrip Ubers than take the same transportation as those they claim to help. A fellow student once earnestly asked me at a bus station if I ever felt unsafe waiting to get on the R Line. I incredulously pointed at the 24-hour police station directly across from the bus stop, lit up like a Christmas tree. It does not escape my mind that perhaps this question had something to do with the fact that the R Line serves most of the state’s vibrant black and Latinx communities. Transportation should be equitable, but it is subject to the same stereotypes, socioeconomic divides and prejudices that affect nearly all aspects of American life — issues that we at Brown are not immune from.</p>
<p class="p2">Every year, The Herald publishes some inevitable columns inviting students to “get off the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/10/03/mitra-18-get-off-hill/">hill</a>” and experience the true Providence. But what is the point of popping the college bubble if we do it in black sedans and hailed rides? Back in 2008, Brown would compensate the equivalent of 20,000 RIPTA rides in one month <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2008/05/14/ripta-free-ride-program-a-big-hit-so-far/">alone</a> — but that was right before the advent of Lyft and Uber. Nowadays many people are willing to shell out extra cash for the convenience, privacy and free charging plugs. God forbid they have to wait — yes, wait — for a bus with adults they don’t know. These students are not popping the bubble — they are making it bigger.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In high school, one of my L.A. friends did not have a car. He lived quite a while away, and traveled to and from school every day on a bus I didn’t even know existed. I had the privilege of a car (a terrible one, though still a car), but I don’t think I fully understood his predicament until I moved across the country. Now that I have experienced what it is like to view public transportation as a necessity rather than an option, I have come to realize that it doesn’t deserve the bad rep some students give it. The RIPTA service has helped me recover my wallet from Connecticut, plan activities with my friends and travel the state. But it has also made me aware of some of the privilege that affects our student body. I still take Ubers to get places, but rest assured that you will see me checking the bus schedule first.</span></p>

		<title>Kim &#039;19: Hollywood is complicit, and we can do better</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By now, you have probably heard of the news that rocked Hollywood. On Oct. 8, the Board of Directors of the Weinstein Company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/business/media/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment.html">fired</a> its co-founder and namesake, Harvey Weinstein, after several allegations of sexual assault and harassment came to light. The allegations, come from current and former employees, as well as multiple folks within the film industry. A New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html?_r=0">investigation</a> uncovered that Weinstein, cofounder of Miramax and the Weinstein Company, has reached at least eight settlements with women whom he has harassed. These settlements were meant to ensure their silence. Weinstein’s exit has since been the talk of Hollywood, spoken in hushed tones and in exclamations in bars, streets and film sets everywhere. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For at least three <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories">decades</a>, Weinstein has been making unwanted advances on women. That Weinstein’s misdeeds have taken this long to reach the public is evidence of a culture of complicity in Hollywood and beyond. This episode has merely strengthened the stereotype that members of the film industry protect and cover each other. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since the New York Times piece first publicized these allegations, many have condemned Weinstein. Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Kate Beckinsale, Léa Seydoux and Ashley Judd are just a few of the people who have since shared their encounters with Weinstein. Fellow actresses Lena Dunham and Mayim Bialik have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/opinion/harvey-weinstein-lena-dunham-silence-.html">written</a> columns in the New York Times following the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html">news</a>. Other columns have been quick to point out that Hollywood consistently condemns Trump for his behavior toward women, but even as one of their own has behaved similarly for years, Hollywood has been silent. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s not often that a mogul like Weinstein falls in Hollyw</span><span class="s2">ood. But it’s clear that these systemic issues of sexual harassment must be addressed instead of staying under the rug. The public backlash has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/us/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment.html">prompted</a> a third of the all-male board of the Weinstein Company to resign. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Hollywood’s highest governing body, also expelled Weinstein recently. With reports that people within the Academy and the Weinstein Company knew of his actions, these measures seem to be motivated just as much by PR as by genuine disgust with Weinstein. The reports highlight a tolerance for this behavior so long as it takes place behind closed doors.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Yet despite all the fierce criticism, Weinstein still, surprisingly, finds <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/donna-karan-harvey-weinstein-apology">defenders</a>. In another controversial response to the news, fashion icon Donna Karan had this to say: “You look at everything all over the world today and how women are dressing and what they are asking by just presenting themselves the way they do. What are they asking for? Trouble.” Actress Lindsay Lohan posted an Instagram video in support of Weinstein, saying: “I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now ...<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’s never harmed me or done anything to me. We’ve done several movies together. And so I think everyone needs to stop.” Both Karan and Lohan miss the mark with their statements. Lohan believes Weinstein can’t be guilty of harassment because he never harassed her, which is appalling. These incognizant and naive mindsets excuse the behaviors of people like Weinstein. Given that Hollywood has been hiding these assaults for so long, celebrities should not try to rationalize or defend them any further.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As students and citizens, it is our responsibility to voice our concerns against sexual harassment. Actress Alyssa Milano has restarted a massively popular movement on social media, first coined by activist Tarana Burke 10 years ago, by using the phrase “Me too,” which gives a platform for victims of sexual assault and harassment to speak out. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Lohan has since deleted her video and said, “As someone who has lived their life in the public eye, I feel that allegations should always be made to the authorities and not played out in the media.” The problem is not that allegations aren’t being made to the authorities — allegations aren’t being made at all, which is why movements like “Me Too” are extremely powerful. While it’s not the only way to cope with sexual harassment, movements like “Me Too” are one option for people to have a platform and a voice. Nothing excuses Weinstein’s behavior or the silence of people who knew of it, and it will take more time to deconstruct the culture of complicity within Hollywood and</span><span class="s1"> beyond, but it is a step forward.</span></p>

		<title>Renshaw ’20: Capital, class and college cliques</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On my freshman year move-in day, I found myself with nothing to do. My parents had left and gone back home, my roommate hadn’t yet moved in and I was hungry for dinner. My texts revealed a few options: hit the Sharpe Refectory (as I knew it to be named at the time) with my two friends from ADOCH, wait for my roommate to arrive or get dinner with a couple of New York City kids whom I tangentially knew. Though I didn’t realize it at the time, this NYC dinner offer was actually the beginning of a rapidly forming clique of students who were all connected through various Manhattan social networks. Similar groups of students from Washington, D.C., the Bay Area and various suburbs were doing the same thing. In all these cases, they’d either gone to high school together, played each other in sports, had parents who worked together or, in my situation, lived in the same building as each other.</p>
<p class="p2">As the school year progressed, I began to notice that though location and high school social networks brought students together, wealth and class solidified their friend groups. Brown students are on average undeniably wealthy, with more students coming from the top 1 percent of the income scale than the entire bottom 60 percent. Not only is this unrepresentative of the wider population as a whole, but even more distressing is that these students tend to immediately befriend each other and stick together.</p>
<p class="p2">While Brown tries its best to create a diverse student body, it’s really up to the students to take advantage of it and break out of their own social bubbles. College was the first time I had friends my age who didn’t grow up in the Northeast, who grew up in the suburbs and could drive and, truth be told, it was the first time I had friends who were completely o<span class="s1">utside of my parents’ income bracket.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I didn’t realize how sheltered I’d been in this regard before I came to Brown. Here, I met students whose parents owned islands they could go to over spring break. I also met students for whom it was a challenge to get home for Thanksgiving or even winter break. One friend of mine told me her mom had never gotten to visit Brown. This surprised me at the time — my parents had come with me to visit plenty of schools I didn’t even end up applying to. My friend was really excited when she got a job as a grader that made her enough money to pay for her mom’s airfare. Being able to do that, she said, was such a joy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As students, we can actively work to bridge the divide and expand our social circles beyond those who come from our own income bracket. At least as first years, we all eat in the Ratty and live in the same dorms, no matter our wealth. Though it can be easy for wealthy people to eat off campus, there’s a greater variety of people in the dining hall. Taking advantage of these common spaces presents the opportunity to meet other students who come from different backgrounds.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition, befriending students in socioeconomic classes different than my own made me much more aware of the range of wealth that exists both within Brown and beyond. Having friends of diverse wealth is an experience that simply can’t be overlooked. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In some respects, Brown can be a social equalizer. When we graduate, we will all be a part of an elite group of Brown alums, and we can tap into the connections we can offer to one another, regardless of our socioeconomic background.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It makes sense that people want to stick with those who are in the same income bracket and share similar experiences. I see myself doing this all the time out of sheer convenience. Something as simple as grabbing a meal can vary widely between friends who don’t have the same resources, and everyday activities like this often dictate who you spend the most time with. </span><span class="s2">Naturally, people want to engage with those they feel comfortable around, which includes avoiding issues of wealth differences. It’s also completely understandable that students don’t want to hang out with vastly wealthier students because they feel out of place. </span><span class="s1">But the point of college is not to stick to the social groups you have always known. </span><span class="s2">It’s on those wealthier students to be more accommodating. And as a University, Brown has done a pretty good job of trying to level the playing field by taking actions such as eliminating the suite fee, providing loaner Mac laptops (along with PCs) and encouraging professors to scan readings so students need not buy as many books, to name just a few. There are many more things Brown can and should do, but much of the work in embracing the diversity that exists here at Brown lies with the students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In her commencement address last spring, President Christina <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/05/paxson">Paxson</a> P’19 urged Brown students to take what they’d learned from Brown and “live courageously.” I believe we should exercise that while at Brown. To live courageously to me means stepping outside of our comfort zones. It means confronting our differences, even when they can cause things to get awkward. It means befriending people we wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity to meet. By doing that, we’ll get the most out of our college experience.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Last week, ESPN suspended host Jemele Hill for vocally criticizing President Trump and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones on Twitter. She first came into the national spotlight on Sept. 11 with a string of tweets stating, “Trump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. He is unqualified and unfit to be president. He is not a leader. And if he were not white, he never would have been elected.” Her charged, passionate <a href="http://www.totalprosports.com/2017/09/12/espn-has-addressed-jemele-hill-calling-donald-trump-a-white-supremacist-bigot-on-twitter/">appeal</a> reflected the feeling of many Americans, but also received considerable backlash from those who felt that Hill, as a sports journalist, had no place using her platform for politics. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House press secretary, even called for Hill to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/09/13/white-house-espns-jemele-hill-should-be-fired-for-calling-trump-a-white-supremacist/?utm_term=.37fcd53a9b2f">fired</a>. Hill ultimately issued an apology, tweeting, “My comments on Twitter expressed my personal beliefs. My regret is that my comments and the public way I made them painted ESPN in an unfair light. My respect for the company and my colleagues remains unconditional.” While she did not apologize for the words themselves, she was pressured into contrition for doing something we all take for granted — publicly voicing her opinion on her personal social media platform.</p>
<p class="p3">But Hill did not remain silent for long. On Oct. 9, after Trump and Jones called for the benching of players who kneeled during the national anthem, she urged her followers to boycott NFL <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/2017/10/09/jemele-hill-suspended-by-espn-over-postings-on-twitter/">advertisers</a>. Shortly after this post, ESPN gave Hill a two-week suspension for “violat(ing)” the channel’s “social media guidelines,” tacitly confirming the misplaced belief that sports are not the place for political views.</p>
<p class="p3">For a start, Hill’s suspension is perplexing because, in voicing her opinions on current politics, she was not acting as an agent of her company, but rather an American citizen with a personal Twitter handle. Yet the White House itself called for Hill’s termination, which sent a chilling signal across the country and encroached on her right to freedom of speech without government censorship or retaliation. While her comments were unfiltered and vehemently stated, this does not diminish the fact that she has the right to express herself. Moreover, in Connecticut, where is ESPN is based, state law <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.si.com/tech-media/2017/09/17/jemele-hill-tweets-espn-discipline&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1508330155554000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHOffkjd3_8coMbEBz5J91kmBM9Xw">protects</a> free and uncensored speech even in the private sector. By acting to protect their corporate reputation and revenue streams, and to placate the White House, ESPN committed an act of censorship that was inarguably a moral injustice. If ESPN had acted as a principled and supportive employer, they would have stood by Hill regardless of her decision to speak politically — especially because nothing Hill said was particularly new or outlandish. Many other public figures have come out just as passionately against the president. And because Hill, as a sports journalist, does not directly cover the White House, her political opinion does not undercut the objectivity of her reporting.</p>
<p class="p3">But it’s deeper than a simple ruffling of ESPN’s feathers. Silencing Hill, a black woman, by policing her social media accounts and administering her subsequent suspension feeds into the perception that women of color’s voices are not important — or perhaps too powerful and threatening — and therefore need to be suppressed. As a black woman in Trump’s America, Hill cannot avoid being affected by the president’s decisions (or Tweets, for that matter). To say that she cannot address that on her personal public platform does a disservice to both her and the greater community to which she belongs.</p>
<p class="p3">By stifling Hill, ESPN and the Trump administration paint the picture that “free speech” only applies to sweetened words that are sure to avoid controversy for all involved parties. This is what I would term hopscotch dialogue — cherry-picking the types of views they want to promote, jumping around the direct implication of problematic behavior and avoiding the boxes of politics in order to save face. This roundabout way of communicating is ineffective because no real issue can be solved from it. The country needs people who are willing to confront difficult issues head on, and Hill’s punishment for speaking out may influence others to keep their political thoughts private. This will lead to echo chambers where different groups discuss valuable topics only within their own circles of safety.</p>
<p class="p3">The point is, Hill brought an idea forward to counter an opposing force in this country and was silenced. This is unfortunate because, instead of being met with a thoughtful, responsive discourse that addressed her concerns, Hill was suspended for trying to start a conversation that most Americans need to hear.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">The Trump administration, with its many foibles and missteps, has been a boon for late-night television. Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert have seen their ratings <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/business/colbert-kimmel-and-the-politics-of-late-night.html">skyrocket</a> after their scathing critiques of President Trump and his enablers. Jimmy Kimmel had one of the most viral moments of the year in May, with a heart-wrenching monologue that took down a Republican healthcare proposal gutting protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Saturday Night Live has re-emerged as a major driver of national conversation — and become all the more hilarious for it. (If you haven’t watched the skit “Kellywise” from this weekend’s show, you’re missing out.) But there is one late-night show that has failed to take advantage of the remarkable political era we are living in: The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.</p>
<p class="p3">The story of The Tonight Show’s unanticipated fall from grace began last September, when Fallon was at the top of his comedy game. Fresh from ratings boost after ratings boost, he decided to invite then-presidential candidate Trump to his show to talk about the election. The interview that followed was one of the most cringe-worthy moments in modern late-night comedy, with an obsequious Fallon groveling — and normalizing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— a truly indefensible candidate. Though he later apologized for his error in judgment, his ratings took an irreversible hit: In the last year, his show has fallen from first to second in the rankings and, with the growing popularity of Jimmy Kimmel Live, could even find itself third in the months to come.</p>
<p class="p3">Yet Fallon has doubled down on his apolitical approach to comedy. When NBC host Willie Geist asked him about his failure to take on Trump in the same way as his late-night peers, Fallon <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/355477-fallon-going-after-trump-just-not-what-i-do">admitted</a>, “It’s just not what I do. I think it’d be weird for me to start doing that now. I don’t really even care that much about politics. I’ve got to be honest: I love pop culture more than I love politics.” Cue the backlash.</p>
<p class="p3">First of all, how does one separate politics and pop culture in the era of Trump? Trump’s shadow looms large and impacts all aspects of American life. His presence is felt on the football field as the NFL becomes the new political battleground of our time; in Hollywood, as the Harvey Weinstein saga has been transformed into a political brawl; and on our television screens, as programs like<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/01/11/blackish-dissects-donald-trumps-win-in-thoughtful-post-election-episode/?utm_term=.a5bad0f12c7a"> Black-ish</a>, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-get-away-with-murder-grabs-the-opportunity-to-diss-trump-in-premiere_us_588b650de4b0303c07532632">How to Get Away with Murder</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and even <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2017/09/miss-america-contestants-take-on-trump-over-paris-climate-accord-charlottesville/">Miss America</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>tackle politics more than ever before. So Fallon’s distinction between politics and pop culture is either disingenuous or misguided; the line between the two has never been more blurred. By sidestepping the specter of Trump, he is ignoring a key driver of popular culture — and, in the process, making his own show culturally irrelevant.</p>
<p class="p3">Not to mention the fact that Fallon is only in a position to shy away from politics because he is not directly targeted by Trump’s unabashed hate-mongering. I doubt comedians like Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee or Hasan Minhaj would announce that they don’t “care that much about politics” right now. Fallon’s nonchalance is a reflection of his privilege as a wealthy white man — a privilege that much of the comedy on his show embraces. As New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino once pointed out on <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/jimmy-fallon-trump-crisis/">Twitter</a>, “Never forget to be extremely wary of every person in your life who has not experienced this last year as a personal moral emergency.”</p>
<p class="p3">I’m not saying that Fallon should turn every single show into a political diatribe. He’s right in one respect: His brand of comedy has always centered on pop culture, and he can and should embrace that. If that means inviting celebrities to play “Wheel of Musical Impressions” on the show, then he can go right ahead. But that doesn’t mean he can’t also address Trump’s new travel ban in a monologue, ask guests to weigh in on the news of the day if they are willing or, heck, call out the president when he shrugs his shoulders at the devastation in Puerto Rico. I never thought I’d say this, but Jimmy Kimmel set an example of how to merge light-hearted celebrity gossip with political relevance earlier this year. Fallon doesn’t have to abandon his style and become what he’s not — but he should at least try to use his platform for more than just the same old laughs.</p>
<p class="p3">My favorite Fallon moment of the year by far has been his opening monologue after the horrifying events in Charlottesville in August. He began his speech by saying, “Even though the Tonight Show isn’t a political show, it is my responsibility to stand up against intolerance and extremism as a human being.” I just wish he’d continue to take his own advice.</p>

		<title>Cardoso &#039;19: Swearer reforms only as good as their implementation</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/22/draft-cardoso-column/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">About two years ago, the Swearer Center began to implement the provisions of its long-term strategic plan. As The Herald has previously reported, these reforms have been the source of significant tension between the center’s administrators and the student liaisons that run its <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/swearer-center-strategic-plan-incites-conflict/">programs</a>. In their recent <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/12/wells-18-salem-18-step-toward-community-justice/">op-ed</a> in The Herald on behalf of the Swearer Student Advisory Committee, Emerson Wells ’18 and Kai Salem ’18 defended these reforms by arguing that the previous model employed by Swearer represented “a continuation of Brown’s imperialist legacy in Providence,” and that the changes would return agency to those in the community with the expertise necessary to serve local populations effectively. Their arguments were convincing, but missed the point: The debate around the Swearer Center’s shifting policies has never been about the need for change, but rather how the changes have been implemented.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Student Advisory Committee is right to argue that Swearer needed to address “irregular student training, constant turnover of student leaders, limited access for students with marginalized identities and a lack of accountability to the community.” These are all legitimate concerns. In fact, in a previous column criticizing the Swearer Center’s long-term strategic plan, I made nearly the exact same argument, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/16/cardoso-19-dear-swearer/">noting</a> that “volunteer turnover, elitism and program redundancy” were serious issues. As privileged students at an elite university engaging with community service, we must prioritize the needs of community populations above our own.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it is certainly commendable to extol the values of ethical community engagement, community-centered service and inclusivity, the merit of these goals was never really in dispute. Instead, what Wells and Salem fail to acknowledge is a much more substantial problem with the Swearer Center’s strategic plan: the many failures in its ongoing implementation. The Swearer Center has treated successful and established programs under their supervision as necessary casualties in a crusade for “best practices.” Its inflexibility in accommodating programs with unique needs has actually, in some cases, resulted in less successful community engagement and reflected the classist assumptions that underpin several of these reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Take, for example, the Outdoor Leadership Environmental Education Program, which is partnered with the Met High School in Providence. The Swearer Center’s pivot to give community partners more agency pushed the Met High School to work off-site with the Boys and Girls Club, rather than directly at the high school. This proposed change, no doubt prompted by a good-faith desire to optimize OLEEP’s engagement with a community group, nearly <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/12/swearer-balances-strategic-plan-community-partnerships/">elicited</a> the reverse effect. According to one community fellow for OLEEP, both parties were already “super content with the way things were” and the Met High School did not want to increase their responsibility. If anything, forcing “best practices” on an unwilling community group reeks of the very type of imperialist tendencies the Swearer Center claimed to be eliminating.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Similar, but more infamous, is the Swearer Center’s handling of the Brown Refugee Youth Tutoring and Enrichment program. The pedagogical foundation of BRYTE’s engagement model has always been based on one-on-one, in-home tutoring. Yet, as with OLEEP and the Met High School, the Swearer Center demanded that BRYTE implement several highly disruptive policy changes, including fewer student leaders and geographic <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/swearer-center-strategic-plan-incites-conflict/">centralization</a>. The changes, however, threatened the very elements of the program that made it so successful with the served communities in the first place. Rather than accepting or recognizing that there existed a spectrum of dysfunction among Swearer programs and that certain ones required limited reforms or none at all, the Swearer Center did not budge and forced BRYTE to seek alternative sponsorship.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The question that Wells and Salem — and by extension, the Swearer Student Advisory Committee — failed to address in their piece is why the Swearer Center was so unwilling to embrace a case-by-case approach. Did they consult with the Met High School before proposing a partnership with the Boys and Girls Club, for example? No, their response was a case study of the very type of uninformed decision-making done without community input that the Swearer Center cited as a reason for the long-term strategic plan in the first place! No one, including me, can deny that Swearer Center programs have historically had challenges, many born out of our privilege and most easily correctable. But there is such a thing as nuance, thoughtful implementation and dialogue; the Swearer Center’s administrators, evidently convinced that their plans for reform were unimpeachable, did not let these things get in their way. As a result, a sincere and good-faith effort at improving community engagement at Brown has instead become a source of distrust, long-term tension and disruption.</span></p>

		<title>Savello ’18: How ResLife fails upperclassmen</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When I first moved into Graduate Center my senior year, I entered my room to find chunks of plaster falling off the dilapidated walls, several pieces of splintered, broken furniture lying around and rat poison in my closet. I had to place six separate facilities requests to resolve the problems, and just when I thought the situation was improving, I discovered a mouse in my room — not once, but twice. Later, I discovered the rodent issue was due to two gaping holes in the wall next to my radiator.</p>
<p class="p2">This entire episode stood in great contrast to my experience freshman year. Back then, the Metcalf floors sparkled as I walked into the brand new dorm, and the adjacent lounge boasted state-of-the-art-furniture and glass doors. There was no debris or broken furniture; everything was newly renovated.</p>
<p class="p2">My story is one of many upperclassmen whose housing situations seem to have only downgraded each year after entering the housing lottery. While the main freshman hubs, Keeney and Pembroke, have been renovated in the last five <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/23/despite-renovations-dorms-still-inconsistent-overfilled/">years</a>, most upperclassmen housing has been left to deteriorate. Grad Center and New Dorm are becoming more and more unlivable, as rodent problems arise, furniture crumbles and plumbing begins to fail, but have received next to no attention. Young Orchard’s radiator issues and ant problems have also been pushed <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/17/first-year-dorms-undergo-renovations/">aside</a>. In April, students in Grad Center found brown water coming out of their faucets, supposedly as a result of the city rerouting its water <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/07/water-grad-centers-safe-drink-facilities-says/">lines</a>. This week, I received an email warning that the same brown water situation could happen again.</p>
<p class="p2">The issue takes on an even greater significance due to the lack of water filters in most upperclassmen dorms. Most first-year dorms have water stations on every floor, giving students access to quality water whenever they want it, but the same cannot be said of other dorms. Brown’s failure to provide clean water to all of its facilities has put its upperclassmen at risk of health problems and created an additional obstacle to staying hydrated. This begs the question: Why has Brown failed to supply clean water to a significant portion of campus, yet offer it to a few select dorms? And why has Brown focused so much of its resources on equipping first-year dorms with fancy lounges, modern furniture, new flooring and carpeting, communal televisions and, in the case of the Emery-Woolley Lounge, a foosball table, while neglecting to provide upperclassmen with new water filters?</p>
<p class="p2">This blatantly unequal distribution of resources has not always been an issue. Brown regularly changes its housing options for each class, and just five years ago, first-years weren’t sent to the palatial Miller or Metcalf, but instead to Perkins, one of the furthest and most notorious dorms on campus. In addition to being relatively isolated, Perkins has also been criticized for its carpets stained with bodily fluids, unclean water and leaky <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/04/reslife-to-renovate-perkins-barbour/">sinks</a>. Realizing that Perkins was so unpopular, Brown redesignated it as a second-year dorm in 2012, and the housing designations have stayed more or less the same ever <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/02/13/campus-housing-to-be-renovated-transformed/">since</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">This redesignating marked the beginning of Brown’s shift towards prioritizing first-year housing. Shortly after, Brown announced major renovation projects to Andrews, Miller, Metcalf and Keeney Quadrangle, amounting to a combined $46 million. According to former Senior Associate Dean of Residential Life Richard Bova, these renovations were <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/10/02/residents-react-to-dorm-renovations/">classified</a> as “gut renovations,” including brand-new mechanical systems in addition to new furniture, floors and plumbing. By contrast, upperclassmen dorms have continued to receive short shrift: In 2016, Brown allocated just $5 million dollars to help renovate Perkins and <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/04/reslife-to-renovate-perkins-barbour/">Barbour</a>, another dorm for second- and third-years.</p>
<p class="p2">Intuitively, it would seem that Brown’s primary motivation for focusing on first-year housing at the expense of other facilities is to boost its retention rates, which are an important metric for college rankings and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings">reputation</a>. First-year students are less attached to the Unversity and more likely to transfer out if they have bad experiences, including with unaccomodating or deteriorating rooms. As such, the University has done its best to make these first-year havens as comfortable as possible. But this has put student well-being and safety at risk. Not only are the conditions of many upperclassmen dorms unpleasant, but they’re also unsafe.</p>
<p class="p2">This is in no way meant to criticize the facilities staff, who do a great job responding to the many requests they receive on a daily basis. But as Brown moves forward, it should consider taking the time to revamp older buildings, rather than relying on short-term fixes. These large-scale renovation projects are obviously costly and lengthy, but at a school with such high tuition, student safety and satisfaction should be a priority. Moreover, if Brown had been refurbishing these dorms incrementally, instead of letting them degenerate before our eyes, the administration wouldn’t have so much work to do now.</p>
<p class="p2">It is concerning that Brown would strategically place third- and fourth-year students, who can no longer ruin the retention rate, into some of the oldest, most unclean dorms on campus. After years of going to Brown, students who choose to stay on campus in their final years should not be punished with inferior housing simply because the University has no incentive to offer them exceptional accommodations.</p>
<p class="p2">When I look back on my final year at Brown, I won’t have fond memories of my housing situation. It might be too late for Brown to fix that for me, but it can work to address this for future graduates before their housing conditions deteriorate even further.</p>

		<title>Vilsan ’19: Revamping Brown’s career services</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[infogram id="3fe7fa90-400e-4519-9a41-a4079464b5ef" prefix="lvw" format="interactive" title="stats"]
<p class="p1">Every year, Brown attracts some of the brightest students from around the world — in part due to its promise that Brown students often find rewarding and successful employment opportunities upon graduation. While Brown does have an excellent track record and has recently enhanced its career services, it can still improve its hands-on advising and targeted job placement programming that would appeal to the entire student body. It is no secret that Brown admits a disproportionate number of students from the highest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html">income</a> percentiles, and Brown cannot claim to be a value-added institution if it relies on students’ privileged backgrounds to propel their careers. Especially during the busy fall and spring recruiting seasons, Brown students could benefit from an expanded career counseling division that dedicates enough time and resources to address each individual students’ specific needs.</p>
<p class="p2">Career counseling appointments at Brown, particularly in the early weeks of the fall and spring semesters, are booked weeks in advance. This substantial demand is no surprise given that CareerLAB currently only has four career advisors for a student body of approximately 6,600 people. By comparison, Harvard offers nine career advisors for its undergraduate student body of about the same size, and Penn has 14 counselors for a student body of 10,400 students. Although Brown students continue to enjoy excellent employment <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/10/google-finds-growing-number-of-recruits-at-brown/">opportunities</a>, it is clear that we are at a disadvantage when it comes to the availability of personalized counseling services. Brown’s career counselors are incredibly knowledgeable and helpful when you can snag an appointment, but they have no way of providing truly customized advising to each student in 30-minute intervals. We cannot expect one counselor to act as a personal mentor for thousands of students. Brown should try to follow its peer institutions’ example and rectify its shortage of counselors.</p>
<p class="p2">Further, the number of Brown students that actually use CareerLAB programming is surprisingly low. Of non-first generation students, only 33 percent reported using BrownConnect to obtain a job or internship offer, according to The Herald’s fall 2016 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/11/11/careerlab-directs-resources-first-generation-students/">poll</a>. It might be the case that high-income students have the means and connections necessary to secure jobs without career services. But if that is the case, Brown cannot take full credit for its post-graduation statistics. Admitting students that have guaranteed spots at big-name brands upon graduation says nothing about Brown’s ability to mold and prepare students to become successful professionals. Among Ivy Leagues, Brown ranks sixth in social mobility — the proportion of students from the bottom 20 percent who attain incomes in the top 20 <a href="http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/data/">percent</a>. If career counselors are unavailable, you learn to do without and use personal connections instead. A system that assumes students have their personal connections to fall back on obviously disadvantages students from low-income backgrounds, who don’t have those connections — and undermines the University’s stated goals of increasing its students’ socioeconomic diversity.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To remedy its current unequal access to advising, Brown should approach career <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/06/handshake-replaces-jib-streamlines-careerlab-services/">development</a> in the same way it approaches academic advising. Upon arriving at Brown, all freshmen are matched with academic advisors and Meiklejohns. Many students find this one-on-one mentorship incredibly useful. In contrast, the process of accessing CareerLAB’s services is purely voluntary and takes a hefty amount of student initiative, not to mention that it can be intimidating for low-income students. Brown students could benefit from a more structured career advising program to help them reflect on their professional ambitions in the same way that they benefit from academic advising to help them reflect on their academic passions. At Northeastern University, this idea is put into practice. Northeastern matches students with career advisors with whom they can meet regularly to discuss anything from job searches to salary negotiations. The university also offers students courses that teach them how to best prepare for the application and interviewing process. Brown students could make use of the extensive and customized advising similar to what Northeastern offers. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Brown can and should pride itself on its post-graduation statistics, and the recent transition to Handshake demonstrates the University’s continued push to improve its career development services. CareerLAB’s recent efforts to target students who could most benefit from career counseling is also admirable, as first-generation students can be matched with employers interested in hiring first-generation students through BrownConnect. But unless CareerLAB broadens its appeal among the larger student body and bolsters the resources it has to accommodate their needs, it will remain a tool that a minority of Brown students use. (Despite the career center’s efforts to reach out to first-generation students, only 24.4 percent of them reported using BrownConnect.) Revamping CareerLAB won’t be easy or cheap, but to truly be a value-added institution, Brown must put its money where its mouth is when it comes to actively helping students pursue their career goals.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Athletes are a lot like superheroes. Millions of people around the world watch sports and marvel at the seemingly otherworldly abilities of athletes. When you watch Serena Williams win her record-breaking 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open while pregnant or Simone Biles defy gravity with her floor routine, it becomes increasingly easy to think of these incredible athletes as only that: athletes. But, because their abilities have projected them to celebrity, the human impulses of athletes are often questioned in interesting ways — like whether or not they should exercise the right to self-expression afforded to them by the Constitution. Sports as a form of entertainment distance athletes from their ability to be fully human. As such, we as a society need to reconsider how we see athletes: not as mere sources of entertainment, but as human beings.</span></p>
<p class="p2">I love sports. Watching people do what they do best is incredible from a fan’s perspective. You feel like you’re with your favorite team as you ride the rollercoaster of emotions, whether it’s the elation of a game-winning three pointer, the anger at a questionable yellow card, or the agony of blowing a 25-point lead. However, we’re presented with and consume sports in a way that allows us to define an athlete by their abilities, not by who they are as a person. I know that it’s not the responsibility of ESPN or Fox Sports to assert the fact that athletes are, in fact, human beings with thoughts and opinions. I like to hear commentators focus on the game or match they’re covering and offer expert analysis, nothing more and nothing less. But keeping the purpose and expectation of sports entertainment in mind, it’s important that we collectively remember that our favorite athletes are just like us in a lot of ways — capable of political opinions, vulnerabilities and errors in judgement.</p>
<p class="p2">Making athletes out to be superhuman is a nice sentiment and serves as a testament to their skill, but it also opens the door to unreasonable expectations. My fellow columnist Bryce Campanelli ’18 wrote a few weeks ago about why athletes deserve a political voice, arguing against the idea that athletes should just “stick to sports.” Sayings like this reflect the negligence I’m referring to — our inability to recognize that athletes are human. If a tennis player double faults to lose a break point to their opponent, it’s understandable if they get upset and break their racket out of frustration. Similarly, if an athlete is upset about what’s going on in their country and society as a whole, they should feel free to express this kind of frustration as well.</p>
<p class="p2">To be sure, athletes can make mistakes and engage in inappropriate behavior. That behavior should be criticized and punished accordingly. But if we expect athletes to be emotionless, hyper-competitive and devoted solely to their sport, we inhibit their ability to serve as role models and change agents — and, in the process, we hurt them. Athletes face a higher risk of depression and mental illness, partly because of the pressure to win. Take it from the greatest Olympian of all time, Michael Phelps, who nearly committed suicide three years ago. “For the longest time, I thought asking for help was a sign of weakness because that’s kind of what society teaches us,” he told USA Today. “That’s especially true from an athlete’s perspective. If we ask for help, then we’re not this big macho athlete that people can look up to.” The suffering of professional athletes trickles down to collegiate athletes, half of whom endure high levels of anxiety. Having to be a glorious, victorious athlete full-time isn’t just stressful — it can seriously harm your well-being.</p>
<p class="p2">International competition illustrates the positive role athletes can play in society when we free them from suffocating, narrowly defined expectations. Every four years, countries send their athletes to compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games. Politics aside, when your country experiences success, the whole nation can be brought together. Monica Puig won Puerto Rico’s first ever Olympic gold medal last summer, completing an improbable run to win the women’s singles in Rio de Janeiro. As part of the hurricane relief effort in Puerto Rico, Puig has raised more than $130,000 to help victims of the storm. If Puig heeded advice to “stick to sports,” she would have sat idly by as her home continued to suffer. Sometimes, there’s just no question that athletes should be active members in society — it’s absolutely necessary for them to get involved and not simply “stick to sports.”</p>
<p class="p2">Athletes are human. If you’re a fan of an athlete only until their existence makes you the least bit uncomfortable, you should question whether you’re truly a fan or just a spectator hungry for a win. There’s nothing wrong with disagreeing with the opinions of others. You don’t have to agree with the way some athletes might choose to live off the field, but that doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to have opinions and be complete people. We admire these people immensely, so why would we want to restrict them from participating in society as agents for change or making any kind of positive impact? Yet, that’s essentially what happens when we place unreasonable parameters on what athletes can or can’t do.</p>

		<title>Okin ’19 : Write before you like</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Apparently, many of us college students are graduating with a degree, but without a basic competency: the ability to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/08/11/why-cant-college-graduates-write/?utm_term=.7f39eadba58d">write</a>. According to the Washington Post, fewer and fewer college students are learning the skills needed to write a strong paper. Social media is partially to blame: With the opportunities to like, follow and retweet, the ability to string sentences together seems useless in expressing our opinions in the 21st-century. However, writing for the public sphere — whether it’s a personal essay or an op-ed — is as important as ever. Developing our personal voices through writing is not only a critical means of self-discovery, but also an exercise in expressing our individuality and generating the narratives that can impact others. The value of cultivating our voices cannot be underestimated. Whether we decide to keep them private or share them with our Facebook friends, the stories we write are crucial to understanding ourselves.</p>
<p class="p3">As young students in college, we should treasure the unique perspectives and feelings we’ve got in this moment in our lives. We will never again be 19, wholeheartedly consumed with our calculus homework; we will never again be 20, inspired and confused and probably revealing too many private emotions in opinions columns. The voice we develop — how we express ourselves in our speech and in our writing — is sculpted by lives no one else has lived and reflect the totality of our experiences. We ought to pay attention to our voice, so we can use it to make sense of our surroundings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But to cultivate such a voice, we need practice.</p>
<p class="p3">The easy “reaction” functions on social media have surely allowed users to feel instant and tangible support. However, trouble arises when we<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“reacters” find ourselves thinking an “angry” emoji can supplant our own, uniquely-expressed response to an issue. This is not to say people should feel required to share their narratives with others, but there is value in fully articulating your thoughts, even if it’s just in a journal. Relying on buttons to express our explicit feelings can lead to blind partisanship, irresponsible citizenship and a lack of preparation for the world that confronts us after graduation. If we allow ourselves to consider a “like” or “share” button the end-all of our opinions, we dismiss critical analysis for the laziness of groupthink and fake news. We forget to interrogate why we believe what we believe and lose interest in discussing complicated issues with others in a respectful, civil way. Perhaps our current climate of political hyperpolarization is propelled in part by the blind agreement encouraged by social media. Without the serious self-reflection enabled by writing, we lose the opportunity to check how we really think about an issue. In short, we lose touch with how feel about the world around us — and hurt our ability to make a difference — when we don’t write.</p>
<p class="p3">Instead, we need to consciously develop our voices to combat the convenient appeal of the “agree” or “disagree” binary. When we train ourselves to value writing as an active medium, we become better equipped to positively influence the people around us and understand our own stance on an issue. And if we choose to, we can share our perspectives with the world and impact large numbers of people. To understand how our identities are best revealed in our writing, we can look to a writer not taught in the classic Brown curriculum — specifically, to the words of Marina Keegan. To know Keegan’s story is to know incredible tragedy: Days after graduating from Yale, with a coveted New Yorker position and Brooklyn apartment in front of her, she was killed in a car accident. A prolific writer, Keegan is accordingly memorialized through a selection of her essays and <a href="http://theoppositeofloneliness.com/about-book/">stories</a>, compiled by her family, friends and teachers.</p>
<p class="p3">In the introduction to this collection, her professor Anne Fadiman observes Keegan’s writing style: “Marina was 21 and sounded 21 … a (student) who understood that there were few better subjects than being young and uncertain and starry-eyed and frustrated and hopeful.” This comment encapsulates what I also found so inspiring about Keegan’s words and the philosophy I want to suggest in this column. Our writing represents who we are, and when we don’t care enough to cultivate our voices, we lose critical artifacts of our identities. But when we do take the time to express ourselves, we become better<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>at conveying elements of our identities in social media posts, essays and speeches. And consequently, others will be able to understand us better. Keegan may not have been writing to change the world, but her thoughtful and authentic voice in her viral essay “The Opposite of Loneliness” — which appeared in Yale’s commencement <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/05/27/keegan-the-opposite-of-loneliness/">magazine</a> five days before her death — reached over 1.4 million <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2014/04/07/review-the-opposite-loneliness-essays-and-stories-marina-keegan/u9gvKsB0d25xY9cf6jDwZI/story.html">people</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">Before I came to Brown, Keegan didn’t intrigue me because of her “magna cum laude” status or the fact she was studying English, the subject I was also already captivated by. She impacted me because she demonstrated how powerful and important one’s voice is. She taught me the invaluable nature of one’s perspective and the importance of letting it ooze onto the page. Next time you’re trying to confront a difficult issue, refrain from simply clicking “like.” Instead, spend the time to aptly express yourself. You’ll find that it’s worth it.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown featured prominently in Rhode Island real estate news this past week, as it <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/10/ssl">announced</a> the opening of South Street Landing, a new, mixed-use commercial and retail redevelopment of the derelict South Street Power Plant in Providence’s Jewelry District. The $220 million project took six years to build and has already been <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/10/ssl">called</a> “an academic and economic powerhouse” by the University, which plans to move more than 400 staff members from 11 administrative departments to their new offices down the hill starting this Friday. This news comes just three weeks after President Christina Paxson P’19 and Gov. Gina Raimondo announced the ground-breaking of the Wexford Innovation Center, a building that will eventually house Brown’s School of Professional Studies. The Wexford Innovation Center’s ground-breaking likely <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/09/wexford">catalyzed</a> yet another development two weeks later: <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gmh-capital-partners-announces-groundbreaking-for-a-174-unit-luxury-apartment-community-located-in-the-expanding-jewelry-district-of-providence-rhode-island-300539709.html">River House</a>, a 174-unit luxury apartment community that will abut Brown’s buildings in the Jewelry District. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Just as Amazon’s search for a second headquarters has mayors across the country salivating, Brown’s move into Providence’s real estate market has Raimondo singing praises of Brown’s vision. “A few key projects like (Wexford) will be catalytic in moving the state forward to the 21st-century economy,” she said at the ground-breaking. She also claimed that Brown’s partnership will spur the state’s economy and bring in scientific and technological innovators. Likewise many Rhode Islanders see these developments as a much-needed move to reinvigorate Providence’s economy. Though Rhode Island seems to view Brown as its beacon of economic hope, Brown’s real estate developments are not as beneficial as they seem.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">First, the entire initiative stinks of gentrification. High-value tenants like Brown will be sure to increase the property values of surrounding lots. How ironic that Brown, rather than a for-profit company or private equity firm, is leading the charge. You don’t have to conduct a survey to realize that most Brown students dislike the idea of gentrification in general. But perhaps it’s not that ironic if you see this as yet another decision by the Brown administration that unapologetically diverges from the collective social viewpoint of the student <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/09/agreement">body</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Second, Brown’s expansion into the Jewelry District will not yield the type of wide-reaching financial benefits that Rhode Islanders seem to expect. Brown is exempt from paying the commercial property real estate tax because of its designation as a nonprofit institution, meaning that Brown-owned properties like the South Street Landing won’t pay property taxes. It’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304050304577377882290627666">true</a> that the University agreed to make annual payments of $4 million to the city for 11 years in 2012. However, if Brown actually paid the commercial property real estate tax on all of its Providence properties like other companies, it would generate about $38 million in tax revenue annually, according to the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/brown-university-pilots-and-tax-exemptions/">Tax Foundation</a>. That equates to a $34 million annual discrepancy between Brown’s payments and the payments that would be received from a for-profit institution, which isn’t exactly spare change for a relatively small city like Providence. The Lincoln Center for Land Policy also claims that these types of voluntary payments, also known as payments in lieu of taxes, <a href="http://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/policy-focus-reports/payments-lieu-taxes">are</a> “often haphazard, secretive and calculated in an ad hoc manner.” Furthermore, Brown could very well renegotiate to a much lower price point in 2033 if it desires. By that time, the University could own more buildings in the Jewelry District for which they will be paying a tax discount. If city officials<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>somehow think they’re getting a good deal out of this, they’re fooling themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is also worth considering that this development frenzy is occurring at an unusually favorable time for Providence and Rhode Island’s budget. Mayor Jorge Elorza announced that the city is expecting to report a year-end operating surplus of over <a href="http://www.providenceri.gov/city-providence-expecting-surplus-second-fiscal-year-row/">$10 million</a>, while Gov. Gina Raimondo reported a state budget surplus of <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170901/ri-ends-budget-year-with-639m-surplus">$63.9 million</a> this year. Rhode Island residents might be falsely attributing some of the state’s fiscal success to the University, a major part of the Providence economy — but this credit is misplaced. And besides, the state’s fiscal status isn’t as positive as headlines might indicate — the surplus conceals the massive cuts to critical agencies like the Department of Children, Youth and Families, with more unspecified cuts to come. This is worth noting, as Brown’s esteemed reputation as a Rhode Island economic engine will wear off as soon as the state and local budgets catch another unlucky break.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This isn’t to say that Brown’s development is absolutely and entirely bad: I am sure that the University’s majority stake in South Street Landing — 136,000 of the building’s 265,000 square feet will be leased by Brown — will encourage other businesses and employers to move into the mixed-use development, which will stimulate wider economic growth. But I will say that the hype around the project, and future Brown-sponsored projects, is concerning. Brown’s redevelopment initiative looks good, but I believe that the University’s contributions to the public good have been — and continue to be — overvalued.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the past few years, Brown has taken several commendable — if also carefully choreographed ­— steps to enhance its socioeconomic and racial diversity. In early 2016, President Christina Paxson P’19 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/16/paxson-discusses-diap-in-state-of-brown/">unveiled</a> the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, which expanded the LGBTQ Center, created the First-Generation College and Low-Income Student Center and hired a dean tasked with diversity issues in the Graduate School. On Apr. 14, Brown announced that low-income students <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/21/u-waives-application-fee-low-income-students/">would not have to pay</a> application fees. And this September, the University launched Brown Promise, a $120 million initiative intended to eliminate loans from undergraduate financial aid packages. Beneath this sleek, well-publicized campaign, however, lies a more nefarious reality: Brown continues to rely on donations from individuals with a vested interest in sustaining the systemic failings that make deprivation and inequality possible in the first place. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">“Untitled (Lamp/Bear)” — the heavily meme-ified “sculpture” on Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle — is perhaps the most glaring instance of Brown’s solicitation of morally questionable donors: The multi-story monstrosity was lent to the University by Steven Cohen P’08 P’16, a trustee of the Corporation whose hedge fund in 2013 reached a $1.2 billion <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/11/05/trustees-hedge-fund-settles-prosecutors/">settlement</a> with the federal government for insider trading violations. But Cohen and his idiosyncrasies — like his inexplicable enthusiasm for crappy art and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/top-presidential-donors-campaign-money.html?_r=0">donations</a> to 2016 presidential candidate and Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie — are relatively innocuous compared to the University’s other financial entanglements. Most troublingly, the Koch brothers — Charles and David Koch, founders of Koch Industries, who have a combined net worth in excess of $100 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-06/koch-brothers-worth-100-billion-lead-oil-moguls-on-rise">billion</a> — have weaseled their way onto campus, influencing scholarship in a way that compromises Brown’s values and undermines its commitments to equality and access. We should all be afraid: The Kochs are here, eager to wield Brown and universities across America as pseudointellectual cudgels in their libertarian crusade. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The most conspicuous product of the Koch brothers’ influence on campus is the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/political-theory-project/about">Political Theory Project</a> — a project that promises to cultivate constructive debate “about the most pressing political problems of our day,” according to its website. According to Jane Mayer’s 2016 book “Dark Money,” which chronicles the metastasis of the Kochs’ political network, the Charles Koch Charitable Foundation gave the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/tomasi/cv">PTP</a> $147,154 in 2009. A year later, the Koch-funded Institute for Humane Studies awarded the PTP’s founding and current director, Professor of Political Science John Tomasi, the Charles G. Koch <a href="https://theihs.org/who-we-are/outstanding-ihs-alum-award/">Prize</a> — which comes with $5,000 — “for significant contributions to advancing liberty.” Greenpeace reports that Brown as a whole received $828,356 in funding from the foundation between 2005 and 2013 — which puts Brown in the <a href="http://polluterwatch.org/charles-koch-university-funding-database">top 20 colleges</a> and universities receiving Koch funding, far above its peer institutions. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To be sure, the Koch brothers’ funding is not unconditional; it has directly molded Brown’s scholarly output. Just consider the 2010 Journal of Finance <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01589.x/full">article</a>, “Big Bad Banks? The Winners and Losers from Bank Deregulation in the United States” — written by three researchers, including Ross Levine, then a professor of economics at Brown, and Alexey Levkov MA’06 PhD’10 — which <a href="http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1069.pdf">asserted</a> that banking deregulation bolstered “the relative wage rates and working hours of unskilled workers.” Or consider the 2011 paper “Racial Discrimination and Competition,” in which Levine, Levkov, and Yona Rubinstein, then an assistant professor of economics at Brown, concluded that “competition (among banks) boosted blacks’ relative residual wages within the banking industry and bank-dependent industries.” Both research projects were funded by the Charles Koch Charitable Foundation, and — surprise! — both generally concluded that gutting regulations engendered prosperity. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I’m not going to argue that these researchers used substandard methods — their findings were published in peer-reviewed forums, after all — or that banking deregulation is necessarily a bad thing. But the conflict of interest inherent to the Kochs’ sponsorship of research affirming libertarian ideals makes it extremely difficult to trust that research. And placing the ideological priorities of wealthy donors ahead of academic objectivity cheapens the value of scholarship conducted at Brown. As part of their <a href="http://billmoyers.com/story/five-myths-about-the-koch-network-and-why-it-matters-to-set-them-straight/">broader</a> political project, the Kochs have used their vast fortune to push for free markets, lower taxes, fewer regulations and cuts to social programs — policies that will certainly benefit Koch Industries, but will severely hurt the majority of Americans who rely on public services and entitlements. If the University really wants to make a difference for low-income and minority students, it ought to re-evaluate its dubious partnerships with anti-government ideologues and stop supporting billionaire-backed agendas that hurt those students. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Of course, the Koch brothers’ coercive patronage isn’t just limited to Brown; it’s a national contagion. The Charles Koch Charitable Foundation funds hundreds of colleges — including most of the Ivy League, liberal arts colleges and state flagships — sometimes to transformative effect. It’s easy to think that America’s universities — putative bastions of enlightened inquiry, devoted to the pursuit of veracity and virtue — are immune to the appeal of cash and power. Yet, as the Koch brothers’ covert infiltration of the American campus demonstrates, even high-minded universities are susceptible to that appeal. And I understand why: Running a college, with thousands of students to educate, facilities to maintain and faculty to pay, is not a cheap endeavor. Administrators are right to seek out new pools of donors, who can bolster the funds allocated to financial aid and, in turn, make the University more affordable. But they still retain the responsibility to ensure that these donations do not subvert scholarship, impinge on academic freedom or contribute to corrosive political trends. As Brown seeks to attract low-income applicants and enhance the experience of minority students, it must also reckon with the fact that it simultaneously receives large sums from the Kochs — staunch proponents of policies that make life much harder for those applicants and students. Unfortunately, these ill-gotten gains — in their inducement of politically-motivated scholarship — satisfy only short-term budgetary concerns and do a long-term disservice to the purpose and potential of the modern university. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">On Tuesday Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona announced that he would not <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/24/politics/jeff-flake-retirement-speech-full-text/index.html">run</a> for reelection in 2018. His decision comes on the heels of another prominent Republican’s, Bob Corker of Tennessee, who <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/15/politics/bob-corker-donald-trump-timeline-relationship/index.html">announced</a> the same news last month. Flake, a frequent critic of President Trump, took to the Senate floor to announce his retirement in a speech that can only be described as an utter renunciation of the president, his demeanor and his controversial political stances. In his address, Flake stated that, “It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative … has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party.” These recent announcements — and the Democrats’ response to them — highlight partisan lawmakers’ inability to present a coherent anti-Trump strategy. But, despite the dysfunction, there is still time for both parties to resist Trump’s dangerous behaviors and for the country to come out on top.</p>
<p class="p3">As Flake and Corker come out as Trump’s strongest Republican critics, they have also retreated from the struggle over their party’s future. They have surrendered to the idea that a vigorous attack on Trump’s base will actually strengthen his hold on the Republican Party. By failing to run for reelection, though, they have cleared the way for the nomination of pro-Trump candidates. But if Republicans who oppose what Trump stands for are actually serious about their words, they can’t just fall back on a soapbox campaign without tangible action — they must stand up, run for reelection and, even though they will likely lose in the primary, challenge Trump and give the voters an anti-Trump option. They may not win, but they can stand and fight for their beliefs. The 2018 Congressional map does not look promising for Democrats, so it is up to senators like Flake and Corker to keep more Trump-supporting Republicans from heading to D.C. Instead, they have given up and only added words to the conversation, not an actual challenge.</p>
<p class="p3">The Republicans who have failed to stand up to Trump and those who are bowing out of a fight with him, however, are not the only ones to blame. Democrats haven’t been doing their fair share either. Flake stood on the Senate floor and delivered a powerful repudiation of the president that is not easy for a member of the president’s own party to make. With one speech, he ended his own career and took a stand against his own party. But Democratic National Committee Chair Tom <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/17/dnc-chair-tom-perez-83-p18-named-watson-senior-fellow/">Perez</a> ’83 P’18 failed to acknowledge any of Flake’s courage, instead releasing a statement <a href="https://twitter.com/dncpress/status/922940836840656896">attacking</a> Flake for criticizing the president too late. While other Democratic senators have <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/13/ratty-sci-li-sigma-chi-tom-perez-time-brown/">supported</a> Flake, Perez — the current face of the Democratic Party and head of its political strategy — made unhelpful remarks. Perez’s statement falls into the same category of political behavior that Flake specifically called out: placing party over country. In a time like this, Perez has proven that the Democratic Party would rather defend itself than recognize the valor of lawmakers on the other side of the aisle.</p>
<p class="p3">Perez and Flake are, of course, quite different, with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>opposing policies and political aims — but Flake’s speech was a climactic moment, which should have resulted in some sort of detente between Democrats and Republicans. Unfortunately, partisanship prevailed in Washington once again. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Trump can be rebuked and his style of politics defeated at the polls, if Democrats and Republicans dial back the high-minded rhetoric and find concrete, practical areas of common ground. Right now, politicians of both parties have the rare opportunity to engage with one another and unite around shared opposition to Trump’s more dangerous actions and policies. For example, Flake, a stringent budget hawk, can work with Democrats to fight any tax plan that will increase the federal deficit. They may not follow the same fiscal philosophy, but they can work together to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/house-budget-blueprint-tax-cut.html">resist</a> a tax plan that will raise the deficit and hurt average Americans. The same goes for immigration, infrastructure and trade policy — there are areas of overlap between the Democratic and Republican platforms, and it makes no sense to give up prematurely or give into pettiness.</p>
<p class="p3">This strategic cooperation is how real change can occur. This will expose the president’s inability to craft good policy and will benefit both Democrats and Republicans — liberals can resist Trump’s agenda, and traditional conservatives can retain control of their party’s platform. This is how we can finally close the curtain on this dark time in American politics. Perez’s statements, however, show that collaboration is not the Democrats’ real goal. They are more interested in scoring political points. A party that has continuously called for Republican lawmakers to challenge Trump now abandons those who do. But if Democrats refuse to be charitable now, how can they expect undecided or centrist voters to support them when it matters? This is the sad state of political polarization that we live in — when politicians see a problem but are too petty to compromise.</p>
<p class="p3">I am proud of Flake for saying the words he did, but if he is serious about the threat that President Trump poses, now is the time for action, not just rhetoric. And Democrats need to join Flake to actually start to make change, not just repeat the same anti-Trump talking points. It’s not easy to take down a leader like Trump, but if principled officeholders really want to make a change, they need to take action and start working together.</p>

		<title>Renshaw ’20: The benefits of “Me Time”</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/29/renshaw-20-benefits-time/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the movie “Mean Girls,” Cady — played by Lindsay Lohan — eats alone in a bathroom stall on her first day of high school because she has no one to eat with. When I was in high school, if I didn’t have anyone to eat lunch with, I would skip the meal. Though I considered myself to be fiercely independent — and in many ways, I was — I could never muster the courage to eat alone.</p>
<p class="p2">When I started college, my reluctance to eat alone got stronger. I didn’t want to be the freshman in the dining hall who was eating alone because she hadn’t made any friends. I planned classes around meals and meals around people. I’d eat with people who I didn’t know very well just to have some company, and I would sleep late in order to skip breakfast. What I didn’t understand was that I was afraid of being alone with my thoughts, and this fear was manifesting itself through my eating habits. It can manifest in other ways for other people: some need to check Facebook and Instagram compulsively, while others just want to watch Netflix all day. A study <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6192/75">published</a> in Science Magazine found that people would rather give themselves electric shocks than be left alone with their thoughts. But I’ve now come to realize that college has proven to be an amazing place to embrace being alone.</p>
<p class="p2">It’s become a lot easier to be lonely in college. With the advent of social media, staying in good contact with high school friends is now easier than ever. Particularly for freshmen, it can seem like these high school friendships are better and more important than any potentially new friendships. We often feel closer to these friends because we’ve known them longer, and new college friendships can pale in comparison. College is also the first time away from home for many, which can be overwhelming and isolating. This emphasis on old friendships can make building new ones difficult or undesirable.</p>
<p class="p2">In reality, the experience of solitude is only a big deal if we’re unable to be happy alone. When I ate with people I wasn’t friends with just to avoid eating by myself, I was basically telling myself that I needed their company more than my own. But if I didn’t like hanging out with myself, or thinking my own thoughts, how could I expect anyone else to like hanging out with me? How could I expect to make any friends?</p>
<p class="p2">That realization was why I started making time for just myself: “Me Time.” At Brown, it can be easy to create an insanely busy schedule, and many of us often do. As if class, homework, midterms and other projects aren’t enough, we also have extracurricular activities and jobs. To top it all off, we sometimes feel a pressure to spend time with friends and go out to have typical “college” fun. But there is value in solitude, and we shouldn’t try to hide from it. The ability to savor alone time has been linked to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/happiness">increased</a> happiness, and those who spend time alone <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/depression">experience</a> less depression. Spending time alone is also extremely important for personal growth. Emotional development expert Reed W. Larson found <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1131927?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">that</a> adolescents “who spent an intermediate amount of time alone were better adjusted than those who spent little or a great deal of time alone.”</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, “Me Time” can come in many forms. The key is that “Me Time” must be purposely created and deliberately pursued. Whatever activities you choose to pursue in your free time should be relaxing, invigorating and purely voluntary. The problem arises only when we feel the stigma of solitude, because we’re trained to think that solitude is a symptom of social ineptitude or personal weakness. We can’t give in to this unreasonable expectation — especially at the expense of our own well-being.</p>
<p class="p2">To anyone who is feeling overwhelmed, exhausted or in need of a change of pace, I recommend scheduling some “Me Time.” It’s not embarrassing — in truth, no one cares at all about seeing you do something alone. My personal favorite form of “Me Time” comes from preparing a full meal, sitting down and eating it alone. It’s amazing to be able to do this after years of struggling with it. What’s more amazing is knowing that I could do anything that I used to do with someone else completely alone. “Me Time” brings me joy and peace, and a chance to interact with someone I really love: myself.</p>

		<title>Mulligan ’19: R.I.P. Morning Mail</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Morning Mail, the daily digest of Brown information that rocketed into inboxes at 1 a.m. every day, was my first friend from Brown. It arrived to my brand-new Brown email address long before I moved into my dorm. Listing the events and announcements of the upcoming weeks, it acclimated me to the goings-on of campus before I considered myself<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a member of the Brown community.</p>
<p class="p2">On Oct. 18, communication officials announced that Morning Mail was being replaced by a new platform called Today@Brown. Though I confess that Morning Mail’s demise was comparable to that of losing a cherished childhood toy, I maintain that it is not just nostalgia fueling my displeasure with its replacement. Today@Brown is harder to read and does not demonstrate an understanding of how students regularly interact with emails that keep them connected to Brown news and the community.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Morning Mail had two parts. At the top was a table of contents, containing the titles of all the announcements and events within. Readers could click on the titles and be brought to short descriptions at the bottom of the email, or they could just scroll past the table of contents to view all of the descriptions directly. Links for additional information could be clicked if readers were particularly intrigued by a given description. Crucially, Morning Mail contained enough information to get students intrigued in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="p2">To be clear, Morning Mail was not a perfect medium. It often contained dozens of announcements and events — a frankly overwhelming amount of information. I would read it when I checked my email upon waking and my eyes would glaze over. I often found myself skimming.</p>
<p class="p2">Today@Brown, according to an email sent to students from Cass Cliatt, vice president for communications, has three primary goals: reducing the number of emails received daily, making it easier to find “important, high-priority information” and providing “structure to the volume of information community members receive to make it easier to scan and digest.”</p>
<p class="p2">These are worthy goals, and Today@Brown takes some steps toward achieving them. For example, it lists events by the dates they occur. Morning Mail, by contrast, reserved that information for the descriptions of events. Having the dates and times clearly laid out makes it easier to skim through and plan your day.</p>
<p class="p2">However, Today@Brown lacks a table of contents. Whereas students could once easily pick out events that interested them and go to their descriptions, they must now scroll through the entire email. I realize how incredibly lazy it sounds to be complaining about scrolling through an email, as though that would somehow cause my thumbs to fall off. But the fact remains that Morning Mail was “easier to scan and digest” because the table of contents enabled readers to quickly determine if they wanted to engage with a bulletin or not. Today@Brown lacks that capability.</p>
<p class="p2">My main problem with Today@Brown, though, is that in order to access any event or announcement descriptions, you have to be redirected to an additional website. There is no single page where all descriptions can be viewed. Instead, each item has to be clicked on individually, opened one at a time to unearth the meaning of a tantalizing headline. This is inconvenient as a millennial whose attention span has been destroyed by Twitter — I want my information as immediately as I want my avocado toast.</p>
<p class="p2">I could just complain that this is annoying, because frankly, it is. But to even the least lazy among us, Today@Brown’s format makes it so that access to information is now entirely self-selected. One of Morning Mail’s charms was that it could be accessed in multiple ways: you could click the links in the table of contents and go directly to the descriptions at the bottom of the emails, or you could go on a leisurely scroll down the page, casually taking in the announcements, pausing if any keywords caught your eye. These early-morning scrolls brought me in contact with events I would have otherwise missed, from dumpling sales in the Science Library to David Cameron’s <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/21/david-cameron-discusses-international-rise-populism/">lecture</a>.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But Today@Brown’s fractured format has greater ramifications than missing interesting events. Important campus information, including news from the Brown Corporation, was previously sent out in separate emails. Today@Brown now contains this type of news, denoted as “Priority” at the top of the email to get readers’ attention. However, unlike former email announcements, important information is no longer listed directly in the email body. And not all students read Morning Mail in the first place — some relied on those separate communications to read critical announcement. Despite encouragement from administrators to “read Today@Brown to avoid missing important communications,” old habits die hard. Students used to ignoring Morning Mail may not pay attention to Today@Brown, decreasing awareness about pertinent changes in campus policies.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The extra bit of effort required may not seem like much, but to time-crunched college students, having immediate access to information, as opposed to having to wait for new pages to load for every single item makes a difference. Because Today@Brown is in its early stages, I hope that as improvements are made, information will be as immediately accessible as it was with Morning Mail so that speed-reading students can be more connected to the Brown community.</p>

		<title>Liang ’19: Let my sister into Brown</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/31/liang-19-let-sister-brown/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ah, Nov. 1. Amid the wafting breeze of pumpkin spice and sepia-tinged sunsets, there’s another thing about today that truly makes my heart sing. It’s the anxious typing of teens all over the world as they send in their early decision applications. Think of all those essays about scuba-diving in American Samoa and building <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/13/jfk-jr-s-83-application-stolen-brown-says/">toilets</a> in Wyoming.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I didn’t apply early decision, but I nevertheless have a modest proposal for the Admission Office: Please, pretty please, let my sister — Joyce Shao-Wei Liang, Aries, would-be Sagittarius and current high school senior — into Brown. Why? Just because. After all, since when does Brown need clear reasons to make their admission decisions? Sure, there are many non-academic intangibles that could affect her acceptance — but then again, Brown has always made it clear that those intangibles are not major factors in admissions, so why should we even worry?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I mean, it’s not like Brown ever considers legacy status, sibling or otherwise. Nepotism absolutely does not exist in any form within the hallowed halls of this university! Sure, former Dean of Admissions Jim Miller once said that Brown gives “almost no weight” to sibling legacy cases.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m going to assume “almost no weight” is about as meaningless as saying “almost gluten-free” or “almost making the S/NC cutoff.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So it feels good to know that legacy will not impact my sister whatsoever, that she will be admitted to this university solely on her merit alone, and not at all because I wrote an article in this newspaper or baked the Admission Office cupcakes or broke into President Christina Paxson’s P’19 house and entered her dreams “Inception”-style.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And we know that my sister’s decision to apply to Brown early won’t matter at all, because when has early decision ever affected people’s chances? The Admission Office’s website clearly states, “The Board of Admission makes the same decisions under Early Decision that it would under the Regular Decision plan.” So what if the acceptance rate for early decision is almost three times higher than regular admissions? So what if early decision favors the rich, the trained test-takers and white people in <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2017/01/12/discrimination-inherent-early-admissions-programs-essay">general</a>? And so what if accepting her early decision means that Brown won’t have to woo my sister during ADOCH or worry about providing her with any sort of financial aid flexibility? There might be a 10,000-word Atlantic article titled “Early Decision <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/09/the-early-decision-racket/302280/">Racket</a>” that delves further into this, but it’s long and boring, and so we don’t have to worry about it. Yawn.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And it’s not like the college-admissions game is money-driven in any way. Money is a social construct and has no role to play in any decision made by this university. The Admission Office doesn’t need to consider how much my parents will donate when my sister gets in (Leung gallery, ha, more like Liang gallery, amiright?). It won’t need to think about how the $69 my parents donated to the Brown Band will pale in comparison to their donations to club basketball, or recreational pole dancing, or nude underwater basket-weaving or whatever weird millennial thing my sister is into right now. It’s not like every donation counts, right?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let’s say for arguments sake that these things, maybe, possibly, potentially, have a teeny-weenie effect on admission decisions. Ordinarily, I’d say that it’s better to talk about things like money or power or privilege honestly than to pretend they don’t exist at all. But we seem to be ignoring a lot of things about college admissions and, for now, I’m willing to sell my soul and journalistic integrity to help my parents avoid the inordinate cost of sending two kids to two different colleges.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Maybe one day I can read an article that features a name like Joyce Liang ’22 MD ’26 P ’46 ’48 ’51 ’59 GP ’74 ’79 and not involuntarily cringe about the admission connotations associated with such a title. But for now, I’m a sucker for the status quo.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So I appeal to you directly, Dean of Admissions Logan Powell: When you’re making your decisions this year, keep in mind that if my sister doesn’t get into Brown now, a school like your former employer, Princeton, just might pick her up in May. Imagine the horror … my family would have to disinherit her. Or worse, actually send her there.</span></p>

		<title>Fernandez &#039;21: The crisis of higher ed in Puerto Rico</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the wake of Hurricane María, the Brown community has led <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/18/fernandez-21-colony-crisis/">several</a> efforts to provide aid to the devastated island of Puerto Rico. Most recently, the University announced that Brown would host students from the University of Puerto Rico to help them continue their studies while the island struggles to get back on its feet. Brown is <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/23/university-enrolls-students-displaced-hurricane-maria/">covering tuition, fees, housing, meals and other expenses</a>, eliminating most economic obstacles for the students accepted into the program. The community is working hard to help the 25 students already on campus get adjusted with courses, campus life and the new setting. Brown has become a leader in aid efforts amongst American universities with this commendable act of compassion and solidarity. Yet it is essential to remember that only a very small group of the most high-achieving students from Puerto Rico have been accepted, an understandable limitation, but one that does not reflect the number of students in need. The demand for this kind of action from private institutions highlights the critical situation in which UPR finds itself and the implications of this crisis for all of Puerto Rico. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">UPR is one of the greatest cultural and social projects in the island’s history. It was <a href="http://www.upr.edu/historia/">founded</a> in 1903 with only 273 students. Today, UPR is an internationally recognized institution that provides financially accessible higher education to around 60,000 students. Furthermore, UPR has <a href="https://seagrant.noaa.gov/Portals/1/Strategic%20Plans/PR_2014-2017plan.pdf">remained</a> dedicated to developing and transmitting knowledge for the good of all the community; it strives to be an institution by and for the people of Puerto Rico and has time and again proven to have achieved this purpose. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In its early history, the university played a <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1101&amp;context=mjil">significant role</a> in helping transform Puerto Rico from an agrarian society into a modern one. In the past decade, as Puerto Rico faced fiscal crisis, UPR became the most powerful voice of resistance against forces that have placed the needs of exploitative colonial structures over those of the island. Just before the hurricane, students shut down the university with strikes to protest proposed cuts in funding and increases in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/us/puerto-ricos-university-is-paralyzed-by-protests-and-facing-huge-cuts.html">tuition</a>. These policies — proposed by Puerto Rico’s Financial Oversight and Management Board undemocratically imposed on the people of Puerto Rico by the U.S. Congress — were in direct opposition to UPR’s core values and would have forced a significant portion of the student body to drop out. In addition, on May 1 students and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>workers’ unions mobilized much of Puerto Rico in a general strike against the financial oversight board that served to further highlight the university’s civic leadership.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While these recent efforts to protect the University of Puerto Rico are noble and, arguably, necessary, it is undeniable that they have caused serious turmoil in the community. Hurricane María has worsened the situation, as the university is now facing rebuilding costs and a lack of electricity, as well as a faculty and student body struggling to survive. Furthermore, UPR continues to be one of the first institutions to face cuts, despite the fact that it has historically been the island’s most powerful tool for development. This combination of issues has prompted a mass exodus from the island. While this is true throughout all of the population, so much so that there are more Puerto Ricans currently living outside of Puerto Rico than there are on the island, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/26/politics/puerto-rico-state-hurricane-maria/index.html">the trend has particularly impacted higher education</a>. Puerto Rico’s attempts at recovery become increasingly difficult when it is unable to provide the support and educational opportunities to those most equipped to make a real difference on the island. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Universities have always facilitated the open exchange of ideas and social development, a reality that is especially relevant in Puerto Rico. It is important to understand that a threat to this kind of space anywhere in the world is a threat to all of us who benefit from intellectual freedom and opportunity. Students, faculty and administrators at Brown have already proven their commitment to Puerto Rican education by supporting affected students. However, this is only a temporary solution. These same issues will continue to challenge Puerto Ricans long after this generation of students graduates. It is time for universities across the country, including UPR, to develop a discourse that addresses how essential higher learning is to intellectual growth and democracy. And it is time for U.S. students to learn from UPR students who have sacrificed and continue to sacrifice so much for the ideal of education, and to follow their lead in becoming agents of change. </span></p>

		<title>Mitra &#039;18: In support of Bannister Street</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In September, the Providence City Council passed a resolution calling for the removal of Confederate flags and monuments from public property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The measure was a good-faith effort to show solidarity with marginalized communities after the horrifying events in Charlottesville this summer — but it didn’t exactly catalyze groundbreaking change. Providence, a northern city staunchly in Union territory, isn’t particularly awash with Confederate symbols. Yet Providence and Rhode Island still retain symbols that glorify another aspect of America’s troubled past: the slave trade. Unfortunately, many of these monuments and signs have lived on unchallenged — until recently.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On Monday, the Providence City Council’s Urban Redevelopment Committee unanimously passed a resolution to recast Magee Street — named after the slave trader William F. Megee — as Bannister Street, in honor of the 19th-century African-American activists Edward and Christina Bannister.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Though the move still has to be officially approved by the council, it has been largely met with support from the community, and with good reason: The Bannisters were truly inspirational people who championed minority rights in Rhode Island and worked to improve the entire community. Edward Bannister was a renowned painter who was once honored as the “Best Artist in America,” while Christiana was a prominent businesswoman and civic leader at a time when women of color were often silenced and forgotten. It could not be more fitting that their names are replacing Megee’s on the street signs that line the roads they once traversed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">However, many other remnants of the state’s unsavory past still surround us. While Rhode Island’s prominence in the slave trade has often been brushed under the rug, in reality the state was a focal point of the industry for years. Brown, named after a family that was heavily involved with the slave trade, is a prime example of this; University Hall was even partially built by enslaved people in 1770 . To its credit, the University is actively working to address its past through initiatives such as the Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice and the Slavery Memorial on the Quiet Green. But other mementos on the state’s public land, including a statue of Christopher Columbus at the corner of Elmwood and Reservoir avenues, remain uncontextualized — testaments to Rhode Island’s links to a darker past.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And if we need more evidence, we need only look at our state’s full name: “The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.” The term “plantations” indisputably conjures up images of slavery and the Confederacy — images that many other states and institutions have actively tried to move away from. A similar question engulfed Cornell’s gardens — originally termed the Cornell Plantations — in 2016, with the university eventually deciding to change the name in response to student concerns. Though there have been several attempts to officially change Rhode Island’s name — most recently in 2010 — state residents have generally opposed the rebranding.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In light of this history, I applaud the Urban Redevelopment Committee for taking action to rename Magee Street and hope the entire council takes up this charge when the resolution comes to vote Nov. 16. But Providence’s attempts to address its historical ties to slavery should not just end with this one vote on this one street: The city should continue to find ways to contextualize its past and recognize the diverse communities that have long called it home.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Let me be clear: I am not saying that Providence should tear down or recast every monument constructed during the 18th-century, when the state’s role in the slave trade was at its peak. But there are many ways for the city and state to acknowledge their histories. On this, they can take cues from other cities that have faced similar questions and started to institute change. While New Orleans and Charlottesville, for instance, have announced that they are removing all monuments relating to the Confederacy, Richmond has decided to add plaques explaining their historical context and additional monuments commemorating those who were enslaved. Though some have argued that this is not enough, it is clearly a step forward from leaving these troubling monuments and symbols untouched.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is much more Rhode Island and Providence can do to take a clear stand in support of their marginalized communities. But in the meantime, renaming Magee Street to Bannister Street is a well-intentioned start.</span></p>

		<title>Grigo ’18: Standing up for kneeling</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Perhaps in response to my last op-ed, in which I defended the NFL players who have chosen to kneel for the national anthem to protest police brutality, a lot of people have been asking me whether I plan to kneel for the anthem during the upcoming college baseball season as a member of the team. Despite my reluctance to provide a concrete answer without the benefit of further reflection, those conversations typically end with the questioner offering two similar refrains: if I’m going to kneel, they say, I should both volunteer more of my time actually helping the black community and help out with veterans’ causes to ensure that people know I’m not disrespecting military members.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While it’s certainly legitimate to ask people like me to contribute more to the community,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it is hypocritical — and, even more importantly, disempowering to protestors — to expect people who choose to kneel to do more than those who stand simply because kneeling is erroneously seen as more politically charged than standing.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s fair to ask these questions of me: I’m a white, middle-class kid from the Connecticut shoreline. By my estimation, I owe everything I have — my soon-to-be-acquired Ivy League degree, my experience playing college baseball, my sparkling family life — to the circumstances of my birth. Given how I’ve benefitted from conditions out of my control, then, it seems like I should have a greater responsibility to help our society’s most vulnerable populations. As it is, I volunteer, I engage with my community and I actively participate in the democratic process to support fairer policies. Is this enough? I’m not sure. Maybe instead of only volunteering twice a year, I should donate a little of my time every weekend. Maybe instead of buying cases of beer for myself and my roommates, I should give that money to the Wounded Warrior Project. Whatever the case may be, it is reasonable to expect someone with my level of privilege to contribute more in terms of community service and engagement. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Yet any expectation that I should contribute more is based solely on my privilege, not on whether I choose to kneel. Those who choose to stand suffer from the delusion that standing for the anthem is apolitical and uncontroversial, merely a symbol of one’s loyalty to the United States. That assessment couldn’t be further from the truth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When confronted with the prospect of me kneeling for the anthem, people have felt compelled to ask what I really do to help black Americans — as if such a refusal to be complicit in a society that is indifferent to the murder of black Americans isn’t helping. They also ask what I do to honor veterans, since in their minds, my support for those who kneel shows my lack of respect for those who have served in the military. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And yet when people stand, nobody asks why they continue to salute a flag that serves as a symbol of our country’s perpetuation of racial injustice and inequality. Nobody suggests those who stand should spend their time bettering the lives of America’s oppressed populations to avoid the perception they support the status quo. Nobody offers the advice that instead of merely standing, they should really help our nation’s 40,000 homeless veterans — of which 45 percent are African American or Hispanic. Nobody wonders why standing to honor our military is considered patriotic and decent at a time when the Trump administration is ramping up the Obama-era drone strikes that have brutally slaughtered thousands of civilians in Syria and Iraq. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The different levels of scrutiny applied to kneelers versus standers are symptomatic of a culture that exhibits both blind deference to our military and general apathy regarding racial inequality. No matter how horrific the atrocities the United States government commits or how imperialistic its policies are, the anti-kneelers will always see the military as pure and good. And no matter how many black Americans are jailed and unjustifiably killed, they will always see the anthem protestors as ungrateful “sons of bitches,” to quote our president. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Challenging kneelers to prove the merit of their political expression through community work is the logical progression of those forces — a form of social control that seeks to erect barriers meant to dissuade citizens from engaging in unpopular speech. Demanding that kneelers have to contribute more to their communities implies that standing is a pure display of patriotism that need not be made with other acts to prove itself. That is wrong. Context matters, and given the current state of affairs, standing is to be complicit in the persistence of police brutality. Standing is to be complicit in enabling a government that, just last week, allowed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain a 10-year-old immigrant suffering from cerebral palsy on her way to receiving surgery. Standing is to be complicit in the existence of our country’s appallingly high degree of racial segregation in our communities and schools. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why must kneelers pay with their time for protesting that? Why can’t someone kneel just because it’s the right thing to do?</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was the perfect day for a run last semester, when I found myself lost on a route to Blackstone Boulevard, one I’ve taken so many times. What a wonderful opportunity to turn off my mind and let Katy Perry in my earphones guide me through unexplored Providence streets! Oh, how getting lost is such a glorious chance to find yourself!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wait. I’m a woman. This means that when I realize I’m at the entrance of a woody area rather than the familiar jogging path, I do not smile to myself, stopping to breathe the air and inspect the spring flowers. I do not consider laying on the earth’s soft floor, letting the moment of spring and sunshine and youth enclose me in warm thoughts. I do not dare to close my eyes, even for a second, to let the scent of the dirt saturate my skin — of course I do not. While male friends might enjoy the moment of peaceful refuge — the adventurous ones even seeking to explore further into the woods — the thought of doing anything of the sort is absurd to me. Instead, my heart pounds loudly. I turn my music off, try to calmly figure out the correct route without cell service. There’s a figure in the distance with a dog, standing in the woods. I sprint away.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A never-ending stream of Facebook posts, with the content warning “Sexual Harassment.” A Sunday morning conversation in the Ratty about a Saturday night, featuring the typical “very creepy guy” at a party and taking an Uber five blocks at 2 a.m. to avoid the dark streets. I’m not painting a picture you haven’t heard before. In fact, I’m sure many are secretly tired of hearing about the saga of being a woman in our current world. Or perhaps you don’t mind hearing our chronicles — or maybe you even genuinely care. I don’t know. But whatever the case may be, we will never successfully combat this culture until we begin to recognize the seemingly mundane behaviors that perpetuate it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Women live a life of different norms. And to use the word “norms” is the greatest tragedy of all — a true testament to how numbed we are to our training: the way we hold our keys walking in the dark (between the knuckle, pointing toward potential harm), the way we focus our vision when we jog (straight ahead, not wandering your eyes at the risk of making any contact), the way we can never, ever be inattentive to our surroundings (you know what happened to her, don’t you?). Activities I watch my male peers do that I wish I could: taking the subway at 1 a.m. alone, trying a new path home at night without hesitation, getting dressed up for a party without thinking that “too tight” or “too short” means “too bad!”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s the little things, the things women have learned to do to protect themselves, these things that actually aren’t little at all, that define being a woman today. Furthermore, it’s the paradox of working my butt off at Brown only to look forward to the sexual harassment that plagues every potential field I work toward entering, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171017/ri-house-speaker-workplace-sexual-harassment-unacceptable">near</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-allegations.html">far</a>. These truths are inextricable from our identities, as they have become a learned part of how we conduct our lives. They will follow us as long as the man on the corner calling us “baby” does.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The unspeakable things will not stop — the chilling news stories that feature a picture of a girl that reminds you of a friend — if we continue to allow the seemingly smaller things to go uncontested. These ostensibly lesser occurrences perpetuate a culture of greater horrors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To my male peers: Share some of our burden of constant attentiveness and intervene. What we “let slide” generates the norms that make the modern-day Daisy Buchanan cry when she learns she will introduce a daughter to the world. It’s the jokes in the privacy of a fraternity about rape that you don’t shut down that make the guy to your left think assault is not so serious. It’s quietly listening to someone lament over how a victim ruined an athletic career. It’s making light of consent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We students are the future leaders of the business, governmental and nonprofit world. We will shape the country — indeed, we are already shaping the country. To my male peers: With as much zeal as you have when you pursue your own professional goals, pledge to never tolerate sexual harassment in your workplace. Teach your son that there are no funny jokes about assault. It is not enough to simply believe that the paranoia women carry around is disheartening; our values are found in our goals more than our thoughts. Make it a goal, an ambition as true as any one you hold close to your heart, to lead your family and your business and your country with this explicit message in mind.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I wish I could get lost on a run, but that would simply be <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/specials/boston-marathon/2017/04/11/the-real-dangers-running-while-female/bIGBjo3EH6aWDC0sx27JeM/story.html">irresponsible</a>. I can be as smart and passionate and ambitious as I want. I can argue in class and write opinions columns. But you should know: Every ounce of this confidence crumbles in the face of a man following me home after leaving the library. And if you think this is sad, consider this issue personally urgent. If not, our daughters will continue to endure very separate norms than our sons.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I don’t have a defined answer for improving community relations between college students and local residents, but if we stop fooling ourselves and acknowledge the effect that genuine, substantive actions can have, maybe then we’ll be able to find a rightful place in Providence.</p>
<p class="p1">When I first sat down to write this article, the only thing that I was certain of was that I wanted to write about Providence. My previous three columns have either been about the University or national news, and seeing as Providence is my home for the time being, why not give her some of the attention she deserves? I flipped to The Herald’s metro section, saw that local candidates are gearing up for next year’s mayoral election and thought, “Perfect! I’ll write about that.” As I searched for background on Mayor Jorge Elorza and his possible opponents, I soon realized the problem: I knew very little about Providence’s government and the inner workings of the city itself. Like so many others, I had been tempted to use Providence as my temporary object of interest rather than a place on which I can leave an actual impact. If we students on College Hill want to actually consider ourselves part of Providence, we should engage with this city in a way that is neither superficial nor patronizing.</p>
<p class="p2">I’ll be honest, before coming to Brown, the only thing I knew about Providence was that it was somewhere on the East Coast tucked between Boston and New York. And yet here I was a year later, ready to give my two cents on the “right” candidate in a local election whose impact will be felt long after I’ve graduated. I had heard mixed reviews on Elorza’s performance as mayor, and of course heard the stories about crooked former Mayor Vincent “Buddy” Cianci, but after only eight months on College Hill, I was by no means the right person to publish that kind of political opinion.</p>
<p class="p2">At first as I was thinking about this column, I didn’t care. Despite my lack of knowledge, I felt entitled to write about Providence because I’m a Brown student and I should be writing about Providence. Isn’t that the point? To indulge our savior complexes and supposedly “give back” to the city we’re constantly profiting from?</p>
<p class="p2">In reality, the act of getting off College Hill and interacting with the community has become a shallow trend, which more often than not fails to translate into meaningful action. We look to Providence’s public events and organizations as charity cases desperate for our participation. Certain classes at Brown include walking tours, mandatory volunteer hours or fieldwork with government agencies and noprofits as part of their curricula. If you Google the terms “protest” and “Providence,” in several articles you’ll find a quote about a Brown student or faculty member’s involvement in a local demonstration. That’s not necessarily a bad thing — protests need the physical presence of people in solidarity to make an impact — but at what point are we contributing to the city rather than taking away from it?</p>
<p class="p2">This past summer I, along with four local Rhode Islanders, traveled to San Francisco to represent Providence at an international slam poetry festival. We were the youth team of ProvSlam, a competitive slam organization that holds bi-weekly open mics at AS220, which was established as a space specifically for local Providence artists during Cianci’s “Providence Renaissance,” which called for skilled artists and creatives seemingly from everywhere but Providence itself. When I first made the team, I couldn’t stop thinking about off-campus experiences I was about to enjoy. It wasn’t until after I heard my teammates talk about life in their neighborhoods that I began to question my rightful place in the group. I was the only Brown student and the only non-Providence native, taking up a space that was intended for underprivileged youths to represent their hometown.</p>
<p class="p2">In spite of all our flaws, students on College Hill have contributed some amazing additions to the city of Providence. After graduating from Brown, Barnaby Evans ’75 created WaterFire, the famed urban ritual that brings thousands of people to the heart of Providence several times a year. On the other side of the city is the Steel Yard, an industrial arts center founded by privileged Brown and RISD graduates. The nonprofit organization provides low-cost courses, workspaces and tools available for anyone living in the Providence area with a desire to improve their neighborhood. What sets these former students apart is that they invested time and energy into the city, without seeking anything in return. These projects are not intended to change the face of Providence; they are small-scale contributions meant to celebrate, not just benefit from, the Ocean State capital. That is how you give back to a community.</p>
<p class="p2">If our only interactions with the city are meant to boost our own egos, what’s the point of leaving College Hill in the first place? Did I feel good about being on the ProvSlam team? Yes. But at what cost? I was proud to be taking up space that was never mine to begin with. I don’t have a defined answer for improving community relations between college students and local residents, but if we stop fooling ourselves and acknowledge the effect that genuine, substantive actions can have, maybe then we’ll be able to find a rightful place in Providence.</p>

		<title>Campanelli &#039;18: Making the right choice in Virginia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The New Jersey race appears to be a shoo-in for Democratic candidate Phil Murphy, as he has consistently polled well above his opponent, current Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno. This comes as no surprise as the state tends to lean heavily Democratic and current New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, is coming off an incredibly unpopular second term. Virginia is, however, far more interesting. This state only allows a governor to serve one four-year term, so the relatively popular incumbent Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, is ineligible to run for reelection. In Virginia’s neck-and-neck contest, the current Lt. Governor Ralph Northam is facing the establishment Republican candidate and former chair of the Republican National Committee Ed Gillespie. Gillespie’s campaign is notable, for he continues to use Trumpian tactics of race-baiting to rile up support. As such, today’s election isn’t just important for the state of Virginia, a microcosm of the United States — its outcome will influence how candidates handle the issue of race in the consequential 2018 midterm elections. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ever since his victory in the primary, Gillespie has been on the offensive about immigration and crime. In a series of advertisements, the Republican candidate has highlighted the threat posed by felons who now have the right to vote — a reference to McAuliffe’s 2016 decision to restore voting rights to citizens with past felony convictions. In addition, Gillespie has been highly critical of Northam for opting not to ban sanctuary cities in Virginia, calling this a significant step toward a lawless commonwealth. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Gillespie’s campaign is deliberately trying to mimic the language of President Trump and emulate his inflammatory law and order rhetoric. This tactic comes as a surprise because, by all measures, Gillespie is the definition of an establishment candidate. The former RNC chairman and counsel to former President George W. Bush ran a traditional — but unsuccessful — Republican campaign for the Senate in 2014, promising to lower taxes and repeal Obamacare. His extensive history serving the Republican Party suggested that he would tout the “traditional” party line and message. But this election is different. Now even the Republican establishment is using Trump’s dangerous race-baiting tactics. By constantly talking about the non-existent threats of sanctuary cities and using racially charged depictions of immigrants in TV ads, Gillespie’s campaign represents a dangerous trend in American politics: Race has become nothing more than a political weapon to scare voters to the polls. This tactic inspires support without any solid evidence or policy behind it, and fits solidly within the Trump brand of the Republican Party. Sadly, it has infiltrated the establishment and may be here to stay.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The issue of race has gotten so heated and controversial in the Virginian election that it has compromised the judgement of advocates on both sides of the aisle. For example, a group supporting Northam released an advertisement in which children of color are seen running away from a truck outfitted with a Confederate flag and a Gillespie bumper sticker on the back. Gillespie called this advertisement — which critics allege glamorizes and exploits the plight of minorities — detestable. The Latino Victory Fund PAC, sponsor of the ad, retracted it from the air, but refused to back down on its message. Northam has said that his campaign did not have anything to do with the advertisement, and though it is fair to say that Northam’s campaign isn’t as provocative as Gillespie’s, he has yet to denounce the advertisement. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This attempt on the part of progressives to co-opt the eye-catching and deliberately inflammatory tactics of Gillespie and use them against him has clearly backfired. From this episode, it has become clear that Democrats need to find a rebuttal to Republicans’ race-baiting that does not also depend on harmful tropes and stereotypes. As establishment Republicans move to embrace Trumpian tactics, Democrats across the country must find a way to neutralize the attention-grabbing appeal of populist rhetoric. At the same time, moderate Republicans should stand by their principles and run on the issues that matter to their constituents — not flashy, but ultimately empty, promises.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Regardless of who wins the election today, the ability of Gillespie to bring what many thought would be a relatively easy race for Northam into such a tight contest means that his Trumpian strategy may become a fixture of American politics. Even as Trump continues to endure low approval ratings, his style of campaigning and racialized rhetoric seem to remain a successful tactic for Republicans. To beat this trend, Democrats need to think of new strategies, because, if Virginia’s election is any indication, they currently do not have a good answer. Either way, as Virginians go to the polls today, they must ask themselves whether we as a country ought to embrace this terrible perversion of race relations or if we want to send a strong message that we will not stand for politicians who stoke divisions between us. I hope they make the right decision.</span></p>

		<title>Savello ’18: Improving our civic knowledge</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last week, while investigating a politician using public records from the Rhode Island Superior Court and State House for a course, I made a startling discovery: I quickly realized my basic high school education about American government had slipped away from me. As I spoke to administrators who asked me what type of court case I was looking for and whether the politician had been in the R.I. Senate or the U.S. Senate, I could barely answer their questions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was embarrassing to confront how little I know about the way government works — especially considering that I go to Brown, where so many students actively engage in political discussions on a regular basis. Rather than take advantage of the opportunity to learn more, I’ve let my lack of knowledge scare me away from political conversations for fear of sounding stupid or not having enough to bring to the table. Over time, the problem has only gotten worse, to the point that I can’t remember basic governmental facts. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I am not alone in this. Studies routinely show that Americans are not as knowledgeable about their own democracy as they should be. For example, a 2014 survey released by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at Penn showed that 35 percent of adult respondents were unable to name even one branch of the federal government, and only 36 percent could identify all <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2014/10/06/americans-grasp-civic-knowledge-shaky-best-study-finds/FIF1lRbxhtALacjnKhSENO/story.html">three</a>. Similarly, in a 2017 survey by the Brookings Institution, four out of 10 college students seemed to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-chilling-study-shows-how-hostile-college-students-are-toward-free-speech/2017/09/18/cbb1a234-9ca8-11e7-9083-fbfddf6804c2_story.html?utm_t">misunderstand</a> the First Amendment. Overall, while Americans have completed more schooling now than they did 60 years ago, they’ve continued to remain just as ignorant about <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/10/the-dance-of-the-dunces-trump-clinton-election-republican-democrat/">politics</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s unclear why this is the case, but for most students, it’s not fear driving this lack of knowledge — it’s disinterest. Given that individual votes do not count, people feel less inclined to make well-researched decisions and maintain a polished political repertoire. There’s also the concept of political distance: Many young people who don’t yet pay taxes feel disconnected from the government and, as a result, don’t feel compelled to learn exactly how it works.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This lack of knowledge doesn’t mean that people are voting less. In fact, our generation is more politically engaged than ever, based on the number of college students who voted in the last presidential election. As we see every day here at Brown, there are many students who have very developed understandings of our country’s political system. But the evidence increasingly suggests that our generation, while more involved in large-scale elections, is less well-informed about the nuances of the political process than our participation would suggest.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In response to this knowledge gap, schools should take action to improve civic literacy — especially at the university level. Most public high schools have government course requirements, but the majority of university students have no obligation to take courses to enhance civic knowledge, and as a result, only some put in the extra effort to do so. Keeping this lack of motivation in mind, institutions can do more to tackle the root of this ignorance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At Brown, for example, there is an abundance of introductory courses in public policy and political science that impart a wealth of information about the government. But these courses often have lengthy reading assignments and can be tedious for students who are not fully engaged in the material, discouraging many students from even shopping them. To combat this, Brown and other institutions should work harder to incorporate civics into the curriculum of other, related courses in the social sciences and humanities, so that a broader audience can learn about the importance of government in various contexts. Perhaps universities could also offer workshops or trainings for first-years and others who could benefit from a basic introduction into the political world.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Another obstacle to engaging more deeply with our governmental processes is that many of us don’t understand what information and resources are out there. With fake or sensationalized news infiltrating our social media feeds and television screens, it’s hard for students to know what sources to trust and where they should look to broaden their understanding. Universities can step in to this gap by compiling these sources and databases so students find it easier to access the information they need — both for their academic work and their personal political decisions. It may seem like everyone at Brown is well-versed in political understanding, but I’m willing to bet I’m not the only one who feels out of their depth investigating and discussing politics.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As we face a looming governmental crisis, it’s more important than ever that the American public be politically literate so they can critically evaluate the unprecedented events of the last year. This change needs to start with young people in the classroom, as these students will be the ones to shape our country’s political landscape in the years ahead. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Exactly a year ago today, the unthinkable happened. Donald Trump — real estate magnate, creator of birtherism and self-confessed “pussy”-grabber — was elected 45th president of the United States. In the months since, his administration has treated us to a whirlwind of scandals, headlines and even threats of nuclear war. It has also inadvertently given us a live-action civics lesson on how not to run a democracy and revealed much about the fabric of this country in the process.</p>
<p class="p3">So what have we learned in the last year?</p>
<p class="p3">We’ve learned that norms once thought to be inviolable can be violated after all. Two years ago, we could not have imagined electing a president who refused to release his tax returns, insulted a Gold Star family and boasted about sexually assaulting women on tape. We would not have given credence to a candidate who blatantly reaffirmed stereotypes about minorities in his rhetoric and policy proposals. We would not have tolerated a president who threatened to lock up his opponent after the election. In the last year, we have seen respect for critical values and the rule of law crumble before our eyes.</p>
<p class="p3">We’ve learned that a hostile power has the ability to interfere with a cornerstone of this nation’s identity: the electoral process. We still don’t know the full extent of Russia’s involvement in the elections, but we know that it launched a coordinated campaign to infiltrate our social media feeds and spread misinformation; hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s servers and released emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign; and seemingly had direct contact with members of the Trump campaign. Yet, incredibly, the president’s voter fraud commission seems more focused on disenfranchising Americans and undermining his erstwhile opponent than protecting this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/trump-vote-fraud-commission/534843/">democracy</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">We’ve learned that the worst elements of American history, elements we thought were all but eradicated, have silently persisted on the fringes of society. We have seen these elements enjoy tacit support from a morally deficient White House and seen them pour into the streets in violence. Hate-mongering, race-baiting and chauvinism now have a voice in the highest echelons of this government, and I worry that their presence will never be completely eliminated.</p>
<p class="p3">And we’ve learned that the governing party is unequipped or unwilling to address these concerns. There have been a few exceptions: U.S. Senators John McCain, Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker. But they have been drowned out in a sea of conformers who have blatantly prioritized their political standing over their self-respect. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has been plagued with division, dissent and general toothlessness. No, our politicians have not exactly been beacons of hope in the era of Trump.</p>
<p class="p3">On the flip side, we’ve learned that this country can withstand a Trump <span class="s1">presidency — something that I, for one, wasn’t at all sure of a year ago. Thus far, the system of checks and balances has proven strong enough to push back against the worst ideas and policies. The courts have consistently upheld the values they were created to protect, a few principled voices in Congress have stymied the president’s most ludicrous plans and state and local governments are pushing back harder than ever. The fourth estate, too, has risen to the challenge of a government that has very little respect for independent media or transparency. In a time when the central leadership of this country is in disarray, many of its institutions have stood their ground.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We’ve also learned, bizarrely, to be grateful for this slow, bureaucratic and conflict-ridden political process: In some ways, this sluggishness has protected many of us from the worst of the Trump administration’s follies. If this government was more efficient and amenable to change, we might have seen a quick-fire Obamacare repeal, the passage of regressive tax reform and the construction of a wall on the Mexican border without substantial pushback. As it stands, these policies have been held back — for now.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But perhaps the most hopeful lesson of all: We’ve learned that, far from being apathetic, citizens are more engaged with the political system now than at any other point in recent memory. We have seen large swathes of the population mobilize, from the Women’s March in January to the large-scale activism before the Senate healthcare bill came to vote. Local organizing has risen to the forefront of national political discourse, the <a href="http://time.com/4570796/aclu-planned-parenthood-donation-increase-donald-trump/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and Planned Parenthood are receiving more donations than ever before and Google searches on things like the Emoluments Clause and judicial review have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/how-donald-trump-is-reviving-our-democracy/518928/">spiked</a>. Inspiringly, <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/358780-women-are-running-for-office-in-record-numbers">more women</a> than ever are running for office at every level of government. And just yesterday, Democratic candidates won Governorships in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/new-jersey-general-elections">New Jersey</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/virginia-governor-election-gillespie-northam">Virginia</a>. As we look forward to the 2018 midterm elections, we can take heart in these trends and remember that this phase is only temporary. As Haruki Murakami once wrote, “Where there is shadow, there must be light.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We will learn much more about the Trump administration and the strength of this democracy in the months to come. I don’t pretend to know what to expect or how to brace for it, but I am clear on one thing: We are experiencing history. The real question is whether we’ll put these lessons to practice, or erase them from our memories and face this same moral crisis again.</span></p>

		<title>Vilsan &#039;19: Revamping Brown’s work authorization for international students</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/07/vilsan-19-revamping-browns-work-authorization-international-students/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">As an international student, the path to finding internships or permanent employment opportunities in the United States is paved with obstacles. After all, many companies do not offer sponsorship for work authorization, and the H1B Work Visa Lottery is exactly what it sounds like — a lottery. There is no way to guarantee that your application for employment will even be considered, let alone approved. Thus, international students are understandably nervous come recruiting season. Unfortunately, Brown’s Office of International Students and Scholar Services does little to make this path any easier.</p>
<p class="p3">For one, the OISSS requires international students who aren’t seniors to receive internship offers ahead of time and create a concurrent independent study course that demonstrates their internship is directly relevant to their field of study. Students must then submit these documents to obtain federal Curricular Practical Training authorization — which mandates their internship be in a field related to their concentration. While all international students, regardless of their institution, must follow federal rules, Brown’s specific work authorization process is far more demanding than those of peer institutions. This puts Brown’s international students at a disadvantage, making it difficult for them to pursue internship and job opportunities in the United States.</p>
<p class="p3">To be clear, the OISSS can be helpful. The professionals at the OISSS are incredibly knowledgeable and willing to help students navigate the work authorization process. For example, the OISSS organizes several workshops throughout the year to inform students about employment authorization. However, these efforts do not change the fact that Brown’s CPT program and its requirements are an unnecessary burden. Satisfying these additional requirements is stressful and time-consuming. And the only other work authorization option is the federal Optional Practical Training program — which grants all those on a stu<span class="s1">dent visa 12 months of work authorization during college or after graduation. Therefore, international students have to make the difficult choice between tackling Brown’s requirements to obtain CPT authorization or using some of their valuable OPT authorization time. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Peer institutions that offer the CPT program, such as Harvard, only require students to demonstrate that they can receive academic credit from their internship, even if it does not directly pertain to their chosen major. Northeastern University simply requires students fill out the I-94 form — which travelers must complete upon arrival to the United States — and receive approval from their advisors. At Brown, however, students must find a professor willing to sponsor an independent study course. The independent study course and proposed employment opportunity must then be approved by the student’s concentration advisor and the Assistant Dean for International Students Asabe Poloma. This process generally takes between two and three months to complete, forcing students interested in applying for CPT authorization to secure job offers early in their spring semester in order to qualify. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Further, many students at Brown are interested in pursuing career opportunities that do not directly relate to their concentration. And many companies welcome and admit applicants with diverse academic backgrounds that do not necessarily relate to the industry. As an international relations concentrator, I’ve noticed that many of my peers choose radically different career paths due to the broad nature of the concentration. While some IR grads choose to follow their passion for international public service, others choose to pursue careers in finance and consulting. It is impossible to determine which internships or careers will logically follow from an international relations degree, much like many other degree choices at Brown. Thus, it is unnecessarily prohibitive to require international students to demonstrate a well-defined connection between their chosen concentration and their internship offer. Ultimately, this rule disadvantages international students as they attempt to explore potential careers and figure out what they really want to do after graduation. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Every year, Brown attracts students from approximately 100 different countries. Although not all of these students seek job opportunities in the United States, many are interested in seeking work here at some point in their college careers. As such, Brown has a responsibility to make this journey easier for its students by removing some of the barriers to summer employment rather than creating additional requirements for stu</span>dents to fulfill.</p>

		<title>Thomas ’21: Diversity isn’t representation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The importance of diversity on-screen and in Hollywood has been expressed countless times before. You might have noticed more people of color in movies recently or that more films about people of color have won awards. This can give the impression that representation has markedly improved. Yet, while actors and characters of color may be getting more screen time, we must remember that it’s not enough to simply throw in a “diverse” cast. Diversity doesn’t automatically equal representation, and producers need to understand why it’s important that their shows and movies include casts that are both diverse and representative. The way in which people are presented on screen has consequences for the real world. Thus, for Hollywood to be truly representative, more diverse casts are only the starting point. Effective representation means showing the complex and nuanced experiences of the people these characters represent.</p>
<p class="p2">Media producers still have a long way to go in terms of portraying underrepresented characters as multidimensional and human. A multi-university study found that Asian-American/Pacific-Islander characters were generally pigeonholed into five different stereotypes, including the “dangerous villains” and fetishized Asian woman. To just include AAPI characters isn’t enough in the campaign for representation. “Diverse” characters need to be well thought out and developed in the same way white characters usually <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/09/asian-americans-in-television-study-diversity-representation-inclusion-master-of-none-fresh-off-the-boat-1202165584/">are</a>. A good example of effective representation is the character Annalise Keating in ABC’s “How to Get Away with Murder.” Played by Viola Davis, Keating, a black woman, is one of the best lawyers out there. The experience of a successful black female lawyer is not often shown on primetime television, but that doesn’t mean successful black lawyers don’t exist. Highlighting this more nuanced experience is effective representation. However, characters of underrepresented backgrounds don’t always need to be models of perfection. In fact, Keating’s professional life is not even the most crucial part about her character. The show’s depiction of her flaws is what makes Keating truly representative: She’s human, capable of both success and error. As such, a representative character isn’t a flawless one. It would be unreasonable for a perfect character on any show to accurately represent anyone, regardless of identity, in the real world. A character with imperfections, however, is much closer to reality and much easier to identify with.</p>
<p class="p2">The problems that come with pushing out half-baked and narrow representations of people have severe consequences. The Jerry Springer Show, for example, often presents extreme images of black people for the sake of entertainment. While this may seem relatively harmless on the surface, using the struggles of black people for shock value is dangerous. Constantly showing dysfunctional black couples fight over paternity and custody further cements harmful stereotypes about black people. <span class="s1">These “representations” are not meant to be taken seriously, but such depictions of black people can easily influence those who do not regularly interact with people of color.</span> Viewers of the Jerry Springer Show might very well internalize the show’s stereotypical portrayals and believe them to be true. They might learn to believe that all black families are broken and that black people, in general, aren’t productive or deserving members of society.</p>
<p class="p2">Conversely, fair and constructive depictions of underrepresented communities can yield tangible benefits for society. The ways in which people are depicted on screen impact the ways they view themselves. A study co-<a href="https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58aeae96e4b01406012fe49d">authored</a> by Nicole Martins of Indiana University found that children of color experienced lower self-esteem while watching television, and cited a lack of representation as a major cause. This highlights the importance of representative storytelling — if you don’t see yourself in all the media you consume, how can you learn to see yourself as a visible, valued member of society? Television shows need to do more to wrestle with this reality and make sure that their casts reflect their diverse audiences. The upside to effective representation is clear — it can reaffirm the value of individual identities and inspire people to pursue their full potential. A survey conducted <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3068499/new-study-on-the-representation-of-women-in-media-sadly-confirms-what-we-already">earlier</a> this year found that 37 percent of women reported feeling proud to be women after seeing female heroes in movies. The same survey also found that 67 percent of respondents agree that showing women in a wider array of professions — including engineering and technology — would inspire women to pursue those professions. For example, when you see Katherine Johnson, portrayed by Taraji P. Henson, calculate equations for NASA by hand in “Hidden Figures,” you start to believe you can do it, too.</p>
<p class="p2">We must begin to think of representation as more than just putting a “diverse” cast on screen. When television shows are not representative — and are, instead, narrow and extreme — the consequences can be costly. But effective representation can help undo the harms of stereotypical portrayals, instill confidence in viewers of underrepresented backgrounds and inspire the next generation of black lawyers or female engineers.</p>

		<title>Friedman ’19: Leave the drop deadline where it is</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/08/friedman-19-leave-drop-deadline/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Oct. 16, the College Curriculum Council held a forum to discuss the possibility of moving the drop deadline forward for undergraduate students. Under the proposed motion, the deadline would <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/17/ccc-proposes-moving-drop-deadline/">shift</a> from the week before finals period to the middle of the semester. While explaining the reasons for the shift, Dean of the College Maud Mandel claimed that many students drop classes near the end of the semester in a “grade management” strategy that operates against the ideals of the Open Curriculum. She also claimed that by implementing a drop date change, the CCC could prevent the “cascading negative impact” that culminates in students retaking dropped classes over the winter or summer at their own financial expense.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These claims certainly make sense and are ostensibly well-intentioned: Why not save students the money and effort of retaking classes if it was that easy? Well, maybe because it’s not. Brown students should feel a little skeptical of such an obvious solution to an entrenched student quandary. In reality, the CCC’s decision is probably less benevolent than the reasons put forth at the forum suggest. The shift won’t just promote student interests and preserve the integrity of the Open Curriculum, but will also counter a problem that has existed at Brown for decades: grade inflation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Grade inflation, the label given to the steady rise in average GPA over time, is the <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21615616-not-what-it-used-be-grade-expectations">highest</a> at Brown out of all the Ivy League schools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The CCC’s proposal could well change that. Dean Mandel bemoaned that 40 percent of all drops occur in the last two weeks of the semester; the CCC aims to convert these drops into C’s. Should this proposal pass, it would inevitably add more C’s to the overall grade count at Brown. Though this sounds like something to avoid, it would in fact be a public relations win for the University, as it would put Brown on par with the other Ivy League universities in terms of average GPA and grade inflation rates. But what the CCC has probably not considered are the negative consequences of the drop deadline change, such as the perverse incentives it would give to faculty and the unfair pressure on students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First of all, faculty members could respond to the change by simply adjusting their grading curve to minimize the number of C’s awarded. Lecturers will be especially prone to this because they are awarded promotions and contract <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/25/lecturers-express-concern-job-status/">renewals</a> based on student evaluations. I highly doubt that students who expect to get C’s will give their professors glowing evaluations. As a result, students who happen to take a class with a tenured professor may be more likely to receive a C than students who take a class with a lecturer who is up for a contract renewal. Although this phenomenon might already occur on campus, the drop deadline change certainly won’t help it ­— in fact, it might amplify it. Thus, the change could just recast the problem of grade manipulation at Brown into another, less obvious form.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I should also point out that homework and midterm grades frequently arrive much later than expected. Since graduate student TAs are often <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/10/04/grad-students-voice-concerns-new-dean/">underpaid</a> and overworked to the point of unionization, they sometimes take weeks to grade undergraduate assignments: I have received homework grades as late as two weeks after the submission deadline. This leads to a pretty wide disconnect between a student’s perception of their performance and their actual grade in the class. This could push some students to take a class S/NC when they should have taken it for a grade, and vice versa. To eliminate the late drop as a recourse for this grading asymmetry would be incredibly unfair. If the drop deadline is moved up, students will likely be staring at blank Canvas pages, begging their TA’s for grades and making uneducated guesses about their performance right before the mid-semester deadline. I already beg my TA for enough. Why should I have to beg them for a homework grade? The proposed deadline would create unnecessary confusion and pressure for both students and TAs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With regard to the Open Curriculum, it’s pretty obvious that the drop deadline advancement will counteract its mission. Students, in an even more obvious attempt to avoid C’s, will avoid taking risky classes at all. This means that students will avoid expanding their skill sets in earnest by taking classes outside of their concentrations for a grade. And even within concentrations, students will eliminate more difficult electives or course sequences from consideration for fear of getting caught with a C at the end of the semester. Altogether, the change will push students away from exploring and challenging themselves — the very core of the Open Curriculum.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And last but not least, a drop deadline advancement will affect the community’s well-being by lowering grades and making students more stressed about receiving C’s. This is of particular concern at Brown because students are accustomed to grade inflation and generally expect higher grades because of the long-running trend. Moreover, this will force students who might otherwise drop the class in an effort to safeguard their mental health and focus on other classes to frantically study for finals in an attempt to avoid a C.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In short, the University should not move its drop deadline forward because it will result in a host of unintended consequences that could undermine the University’s goals and place unnecessary pressures on students and TAs alike. Until issues such as the lecturer incentives system and the treatment of graduate student TAs are dealt with in their entirety, the CCC should take the drop deadline change out of consideration.</span><em> </em></p>

		<title>Blasberg &#039;18: Will United States mens’ soccer ever be up to snuff?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago this October, the United States Men’s National Soccer Team was eliminated from World Cup contention, missing out on the tournament for the first time since 1986. Even before Trinidad and Tobago sealed their fate, a string of losses and poor play early in the qualification stages raised major doubts for the USMNT. How did the United States get in this mess, and is there a way out?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite having resources and opportunities, the team has been mired in mediocrity, compared to America’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>success in other sports. The United States enjoys perennial success in sports that it invented and has monopolized, like baseball, basketball and football. But the country also wins on the international stage in other sports with a more level playing field. Recent medals in hockey, track and field, swimming and gymnastics show that the United States does not need to invent the sport to succeed in it. So why is soccer different? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The answer is that the bar is simply a lot higher in soccer. In most countries besides the United States, soccer is a way of life. Dribbling, juggling, passing and shooting are second nature, similar to the way throwing a baseball or shooting a basketball is natural for many Americans. As the most popular sport in many countries around the world, soccer attracts the premiere young athletes, whereas many of the best young Americans gravitate toward the four “major” sports that are visible in the media and dole out the biggest paychecks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The United States already starts at a disadvantage to countries that have soccer ingrained as the primary sport in their culture, but it does have the resources for national team development and support that other countries cannot match. As a result, the United States has been able stay relevant in World Cup competitions, sneaking into the top eight in 2010 and tying Portugal to advance to the round of 16 in 2014. This time around, the building came tumbling down in the early stages of World Cup qualification, with back-to-back losses against Costa Rica and Mexico and the ousting of long-time head coach Jurgen Klinsmann.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, in the later stages of qualification, the United States turned things around, revealing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>some bright signs for the future. Bruce Arena replaced Klinsmann as head coach and the team bounced back with a stretch of wins and draws, bringing them closer to qualification. In this period, 19-year-old Christian Pulisic emerged as the team’s undisputed best player. He was involved in 12 of United States’ 17 goals in the last round of qualification. He provides promise at the striker position with the finesse and quickness needed to score on the international stage. Were it not for a last-minute tie against Honduras in the third-to-last match and a loss to Trinidad and Tobago in the final match, the United States would have been able to successfully right the ship and qualify for the World Cup in Russia.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hope for the USMNT resides in youth. Pulisic leads the group as a starter in the latest international matches, but the United States’ investment in its junior teams is paying off. Weston McKennie, Jonathan Gonzalez and Tyler Adams are all teenagers playing professionally ready to answer the bell in the next round of World Cup qualifying in 2019. A stagnant midfield unable to feed the strikers is one of the main issues for the team right now, and Gonzalez and Adams will be able to fill that hole.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On a larger scale, Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber has a plan for the rise of soccer as another one of America’s major professional sports. Between 1999 and now, the MLS has almost doubled in size, from 12 teams to 22, not including two additional clubs slated to spring up in Miami and Los Angeles by 2019. The value of these teams has increased about 80 percent over the last four years, and with more prominent television spots and stadiums, the MLS has grown in visibility. Garber has also implemented programs to incentivize youth participation in soccer. With involvement in football steadily declining due to the dangerous consequences of head injuries and brain trauma, soccer may be well suited to act as a substitute fall sport.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the inexcusable loss to Trinidad and Tobago that excluded the USMNT from World Cup participation, it has a number of bright spots in the young players who will fill in at midfield. The role of the MLS is also increasing in American culture and media and that will do favors for the national team going forward. While the United States missed out on this World Cup this year, they are well-positioned to be a team of the future.</span></p>

		<title>Richardson &#039;20: How #MeToo has forgotten black women</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of a sudden, the entertainment industry has started to see a plethora of women come forward with sexual assault allegations against Hollywood powerhouses such as James Toback, Ed Westwick, Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein. The growing number of allegations against Weinstein in particular has culminated in the emergence of the #MeToo campaign as a means of standing in solidarity against gender-based violence and harassment. The movement is much-needed, yet I can’t help but ask a simple question: “Why now?” Why didn’t a similar mass movement emerge from the many allegations against Bill Cosby and R. Kelly, for example? Let’s brainstorm for a moment: Maybe because Weinstein’s accusers were famous, white, wealthy women with platforms to amplify their voices. When we look more closely at the #MeToo movement and how we have responded to sexual misconduct in Hollywood, the social and racial undertones are unavoidable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Don’t get me wrong: It’s great that sexual harassment is finally being given the attention that it deserves, but it is disappointing that it appears to privilege some survivors over others. As significant as it is to the landscape of gender equity across the country, #MeToo has become a mouthpiece for well-off white women while excluding and shunning the voices of black women. This should startle us, because black women <a href="https://mcasa.org/assets/files/African-American-Women-and-Sexual-Assault1.pdf">face higher rates of sexual assault</a> than women of other races. And to make matters worse, the hashtag’s original creator — Tarana Burke, a black woman — was initially ignored and arguably forgotten until Alyssa Milano, a white woman, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43akqp/the-problem-with-the-metoo-campaign">co-opted the hashtag and broke the Internet</a>. It’s frustrating that a movement created by a black woman has now become an accessory to the erasure of voices like her own.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the United States finally seems ready to comfort and support sexual assault survivors, this sense of solidarity still isn’t available to all women. We consistently overlook the struggles of women of color and low-income women who need access to the same support systems as the more privileged women whose voices we are currently elevating. In the four weeks since the allegations against Weinstein first emerged, additional women have come forward to accuse Weinstein, an entire movement has snowballed on social media and the New York Police Department has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-harvey-weinstein-nypd-20171103-story.html">reportedly</a> began preparing a case against him. This reaction is both admirable and a bit unsettling. Where was this sense of urgency when yet another underage black woman was left alone in a studio with R. Kelly? The lack of attention given to these stories implies that the claims of women of color are invalid or unimportant, which plays into the invisibility of black women. The inability of this country to rally around black women, as it did for #MeToo, showcases who it places its importance on — and who it doesn’t.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This isn’t to say that the collective claims against Weinstein are not legitimate and did not warrant the response they engendered. But the fact that the voices of black women are not granted the same agency given to other women is a severe injustice. Their consistent allegations, across decades, against Hollywood men like Bill Cosby and R. Kelly never managed to create a national campaign like #MeToo. The high rates of sexual violence faced by many black women have been shrugged off by indifferent policymakers and stakeholders. I’m not arguing that we need a movement that solely seeks justice for black women, but any movement to rid the country of sexual harassment must include them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Plus, it’s hard enough for black women to speak out in the first place — studies <a href="https://endsexualviolencect.org/resources/get-the-facts/women-of-color-and-sexual-assault/">suggest</a> that only one in 15 black women reports her sexual assault to the police. Since they face the <a href="http://www.doj.state.or.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/women_of_color_network_facts_domestic_violence_2006.pdf">highest rates of sexual violence</a> from black men, the last thing many of them want to do is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-black-women-sexual-assault-20170828-story.html">aid in the criminalization</a> of their black brothers. And considering there’s general distrust between the black community and police departments, the likelihood of black women coming forward is slim to none. Then, add in the fact that low-income women may stay silent to avoid alienating their family members or employers, and we can see that black women must overcome hurdle after hurdle to report sexual assault.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So just what is united about the United States? Instead of responding equally to the valid accusations from women of all races, we have — consciously or unconsciously — placed their rights second to their race in deciding whether or not they’re worthy of invoking nation-wide change. This is a sad sentiment considering that the overall goal of this movement is to confront powerful men, or all men really, who use their positions to prey on women. Clearly, we need a more equitable campaign that includes all women and gives women of color equal weight and space. Excluding their intersecting concerns and needs because they’re people of color will only set the movement for gender equality back. If nothing else, the least we owe black women is an active effort to re-center attention on them and their struggles, because it’s long overdue.</span></p>

		<title>Mulligan ’19: The cost of daylight saving</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/12/mulligan-19-cost-daylight-saving/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2017 03:18:45 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every year in November, I hear people complain about the end of Daylight Saving Time, and I understand why. In New England especially, the sudden earliness of sunsets can be a shock. To paraphrase a classmate of mine, the dark has a way of making you feel as though you should put on your pajamas and get into bed — an unproductive action when it is only 6 p.m. and you still have piles of homework to attack.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the changing of the clocks can be little more than an annoyance for some, for others it affects health detrimentally. Businesses are the primary benefactors of DST. Opposing DST should be part of the larger social justice movement that aims to put people’s physical and mental wellbeing over corporate profitability.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DST began as a temporary <a href="http://time.com/4549397/daylight-saving-time-history-politics/">measure</a> to conserve energy during World War I, and was reintroduced for the same reasons during World War II. Following the end of the war, while no longer observed nationally, cities and counties continued to set their own policies regarding the time change. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 reserved the power to opt in or out of DST for states alone. It also ensured that all states who took part moved their clocks at the same time. The most recent update to the act came with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which led to the majority of the United States observing DST for eight months of the year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though DST was created to conserve energy, recent research suggests that it doesn’t. The Department of Energy found in 2008 that DST lowered yearly energy consumption by one-third of a percent. But multiple other studies found no energy savings, and one study even pointed to energy use increasing during DST by up to 1 percent. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given that DST has a negligible effect on energy conservation, it is clear that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it is most advantageous for people who benefit financially from it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Turns out, more hours of sunlight very clearly encourages consumption. People are more inclined to go out and spend during the daytime. Convenience stores, golf courses and retailers of outdoor activities equipment have all lobbied in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/us/daylight-saving-time-farmers.html">support</a> of DST. In 2010, the then-chairman of the Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing estimated that convenience stores pocketed an additional $1 billion a year since DST was lengthened in 1986.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But any monetary benefit comes at a cost to our wellbeing. While 2007 research associated DST with a reduced number of traffic accidents, a more recent study from the University of Colorado found the opposite, linking DST to a higher rate of fatal accidents. The first days after DST goes into effect each year show increased <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/health/daylight-saving-time-health-effects/index.html">rates</a> of strokes and heart attacks. And having time springing forward and falling back impacts circadian rhythms, upsetting sleep cycles.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Its toll on mental health is also just as serious. A study published in Epidemiology in May 2017 found an 11 percent increase in diagnoses of unipolar <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/health/fall-back-time-transition-depression/index.html">depression</a> in the first two months after DST ends. Although more work is needed to determine the reasons for that association, the researchers proposed that it is linked to the “psychological distress” of the sun suddenly setting an hour earlier. Their work was praised by Norman Rosenthal, the first researcher to diagnose and treat seasonal affective disorder, a condition in which people experience depression at a particular point in the year, often coinciding with the shortening winter days.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DST is exactly the sort of cause that should attract people’s attention; it is emblematic of a society where lobbyists encourage the government to put profits ahead of health. It’s time to focus on what research says about DST’s negative impacts to human physiology, rather than on corporate interests. </span></p>

		<title>Samilow &#039;19: Dennis Ross and the folly of anti-Israel pressure</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">No one’s been closer than Ambassador Dennis Ross to pulling off what President Trump described as the “ultimate deal” — a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. During the fateful days of the Camp David Summit in July 2000, it was Ross — then U.S. envoy to the Middle East — who nearly brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat all the way to ending one of the world’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/03/israel2">longest-running</a> conflicts. Ross wheedled the opposing leaders and hammered out contentious particulars, learning more about the contours of the conflict and its players than perhaps anyone else on earth. His work to bring about Israeli–Palestinian peace spanned the tenures of former Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and his fingerprints are on every diplomatic development that has transpired in Israel in the past 25 years.</p>
<p class="p2">So it was with considerable excitement that 150 students and community members filed into Salomon 001 last Thursday for the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/12/dennis-ross-talks-israel-palestine-peace-prospects/">event</a> with Ross, titled “The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Then and Now,” hosted by Brown Students for Israel in partnership with the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. Ross began by casting the Israeli–Palestinian situation as a fundamentally territorial struggle between two national movements, both of which were legitimate and worthy of fulfillment. “There are two rights, not a right and wrong,” he emphasized as the guiding principal of his peacemaking efforts. In recognizing this, Ross exposed the illogic of trying to boycott or “punish” Israel out of frustration that the conflict hasn’t yet ended. Lasting peace in the region won’t come from punitive measures against Israel, but from diplomatic compromises that the Palestinian Authority has thus far not been amenable to.</p>
<p class="p2">As an audience member at the event, I asked Ross if peace talks in 2000 met the Palestinians’ needs, and he replied unequivocally that they did. He explained that the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/middle-east-peace-plans-background">Clinton Parameters</a> — guidelines he authored that specified the concessions the two parties would make — <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2001/08/09/camp-david-the-tragedy-of-errors/">provided</a> for the Palestinians to receive 95 percent of the West Bank, the entire Gaza Strip and control over the Arab parts of Jerusalem over the course of six years, as well as financial help establishing state institutions.</p>
<p class="p2">But the Palestinian leadership summarily rejected the proposal. I pressed him further about the nature of the rejection, noting that many Palestinians claim that Israel’s offer was not really generous at all and would have left them with a disjointed state that lacked physical autonomy and economic independence. Ross, who was intimately involved in drafting what would become the Israeli offer, answered that these allegations were “nonsense” — myths created after the fact to justify the Palestinian position. As the Clinton Parameters outlined, the West Bank would have been <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Opinion/A-sovereign-Palestine">connected</a> to Gaza via an elevated highway and railroad, and a $30 billion fund would have been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/opinion/09ross.html">created</a> to support Palestinian refugees.</p>
<p class="p2">I continued: If Israel’s spurned offer was generous, is there any reason — other than wishful thinking — to believe that an agreement can be reached in the future? Indeed, Ross conceded, Israel would likely be less able and willing to offer the Palestinians as much as it did in the Clinton Parameters due to the threats to Israeli security posed by the growing instability of Israel’s neighbors.</p>
<p class="p2">In my view, there are only three logical explanations as to why the Palestinians rejected the Clinton Parameters in 2000. First, maybe the deal met the needs of the Palestinian people, but the leadership was short-sighted or mistaken and turned it down anyway. Second, the deal may have been flat-out unfair or inadequate, making the Palestinians right to reject it. Or third, perhaps the Palestinians had not yet come to terms with Israel’s permanence, and therefore they believed that they could simply outlast Israel and get all the land.</p>
<p class="p2">Ross emphatically refuted the second option, explaining that Israel made wide-ranging concessions on a number of critical issues. Seeing as he was there in 2000, I’m inclined to defer to his assessment. Ross also dismissed the third option, citing polls that show popular support on both sides for the two-state solution. Indeed, he believes that both Israelis and Palestinians truly desire a two-state solution, but are skeptical that it can actually happen, decreasing the likelihood that politicians make risky compromises.</p>
<p class="p2">So that leaves the first option as the correct explanation. Of course, if it is Palestinian diplomacy that is responsible for the peace logjam, then coercion aimed at Israel makes no sense. This is so, no matter how much one detests Israel’s policies in the West Bank and Gaza or sympathizes with the Palestinians. Israel acquired the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 during a war, and can cede them only through a diplomatic settlement. Whenever a country exercises military control over a civilian population, it is sometimes compelled to engage in practices that are repressive and damaging to civilians. Israel is no exception, though its respect for civilian life compares quite <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-did-not-commit-war-crimes-in-gaza-says-multi-national-military-group/">favorably</a> when stacked against other countries. The obvious solution is Palestinian self-government, but that cannot happen without a diplomatic agreement. And in 2000, the Palestinian Authority was unwilling to even negotiate over Israel’s offer more than 95 percent of the West Bank within six years (everything minus the most built-up settlements and non-negotiable security zones), Gaza and compensatory land-swaps from its sovereign territory. It is difficult to imagine what more Israel could have conceded.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with boycotting a country whose behavior you find objectionable. But if a boycott or punishment is to be productive, the boycotters have to state clearly how they’d like the country to reform itself, and such expectations have to be reasonable and practicable. Otherwise, the punishment has no just goal and serves only to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/state-report-boycott-could-cost-israel-nis-40-billion-per-year/">impoverish</a> a civilian population. “End the occupation” is a stirring and emotionally-appealing talking point, and may sound eminently reasonable. But without a negotiated plan for what is to succeed Israeli rule in the West Bank — something that can happen only with the participation of a recalcitrant Palestinian leadership — it’s just that: a talking point. It is inconceivable for a country to yield territory without assurances that it won’t regret doing so. Punishing Israel for the torpor of the Palestinian Authority would be like rewarding intentional handballs with penalty kicks.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Dearest Jeff Bezos,</p>
<p class="p2">You’re probably feeling a little bit like the bachelor on the ABC hit TV show “The Bachelor” right now. You’ve made it known that you’re looking for a commitment, and that’s not something that we cities can just let go. I don’t know how it feels having everyone pine for your attention, but that’s because I’m an undiscovered gem. I can only empathize with the exhaustion you must be feeling having every single major city in America open up about the future they see with you, how excited they are that you’re ready to settle down with someone new, how many buildings they envision you two having together and the places you’ll be able to travel to. I’m sure they’re all starting to blur together.</p>
<p class="p2">Jeff, I’m here to tell you that I’m different.</p>
<p class="p2">My name is Providence, Rhode Island. I’m usually seen as a quirky and hipster city. Kind of like <a href="http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2017/10/amazon_hq2_proposals_louisiana.html">New Orleans</a>, except New Orleans decided it was too good for you and didn’t even offer you a bid. Jeff, you deserve to be with someone who wants you. I even have my very own major airport. It’s called T.F. Green and it’s spectacular. That’s right. I’m worldly, international even, with $99 flights to Iceland via Norwegian Air. All of your friends can come visit!</p>
<p class="p2">Did you know that Rhode Island is the Ocean State? And yes, okay, I understand that Seattle is coastal and that the Pacific Ocean is pretty damn nice, but wouldn’t you also want to be with me, where the temperature changes? I mean really changes — in the winter it’s about 28 degrees Fahrenheit<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and in the summer, it can get all the way up to 86 degrees!</p>
<p class="p2">I know you’re all about innovation and development. You run a dynamic company, and you don’t want to stand still. I get that. That’s why every week, I unleash a different form of weather on everyone here. Two weeks ago, everyone was in shorts; last week, I made everyone break out their winter jackets. Oh yeah — and I surprised everyone with bursts of rain. I like to try new things and implement different strategies, just like you.</p>
<p class="p2">I know that I might not be exactly what you’re looking for, and though that’s disappointing for me, I actually have a lot of siblings who also happen to be looking for a nice guy like you to settle down with! They include Pawtucket and Warwick. We offer a lot of the same <a href="http://wpri.com/2017/10/19/ri-proposes-7-sites-for-new-amazon-hq2/">benefits</a>, actually, including pre-permitted sites and access to major interstates and ports. We really just want you to be a member of our Rhode Island family. That’s why I won’t be completely bummed if you go for one of them over me. I know you value culture and teamwork very much, and my family does as well. We all live very close together — none of us are more than an hour away from each other — and that empowers us to work collaboratively together.</p>
<p class="p2">I’m not trying to give you special favors to earn your trust, like Tucson who sent you a 21-foot Saguaro <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/04/technology/amazon-second-headquarters-city-proposals/index.html">cactus</a> which you had to send back home. I won’t demand that you pay for dinner on our dates — I have a very reasonable cost of living. Nor am I making promotional videos for myself, like Detroit, Boston, Pittsburgh and all the rest. Instead, I made myself an entire <a href="https://www.riforamazon.us/">website</a>!</p>
<p class="p2">I also have a lot of friends who are looking forward to getting to know you as well. As you might know, over one-sixth of Brown undergraduates are computer science majors. It’s no coincidence that recruiting season is upon us, Jeff, and if you and I got together, there’s no doubt in my mind that as soon as those students pass through the Van Wickle gates, they’ll walk right down College Hill and through the doors of your second headquarters.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Alright, I might be getting ahead of myself. When I like someone — and believe me Jeffrey, I like you — I have the tendency to dream about our future together and what our lives will be like. I don’t mean to scare you — of course there’s no pressure to choose me — but my family is so small that we don’t get a lot of attention. When you put your call out, we didn’t hesitate to respond, unlike San Antonio, who didn’t appreciate your initiative. There’s no doubt I’m ready for the long haul, and I’m ready for it with you.</span></p>
<p class="p2">With great warmth and humility,</p>
<p class="p2">Providence, Rhode Island</p>

		<title>Fernandez ’21: Responsibilities of the Latinx community in the US</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/14/fernandez-21-responsibilities-latinx-community-us/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Across the United States, the Latinx community — now the largest ethnic or racial minority in the country — has grown more prominent in cultural, social and political spheres. Part of this rapid growth can be attributed to strong cultural connections that arise from a shared history. However, as Latin America <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/20/us/hispanics-in-the-u-s-/index.html">continues</a> to wrestle with complicated problems of inequality and development, it is important to step back and discuss the implications of being a member of the growing U.S. Latinx community. Who makes up the Latinx community in the United States? Why are they connected more by cultural rather than political discourses? How do they represent the people who are still currently living in Latin America? These questions are tough to answer, and the Latinx community residing in the United States must actively support those who are still living and breathing age-old Latin American struggles, especially when it comes to the central problem of colonial and post-colonial exploitation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a first-year at Brown from a Latino background, living in the continental United States for the first time, I have noticed and experienced a complicated relationship between Latinx communities inside and outside of Latin America. In recent <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/09/23/unaccompanied-minors-central-america-rushing-across-us-border/90911644/">years</a>, the mass exodus of people from countries in South and Central America as well as in the Caribbean to the United States have brought mainstream attention to long-entrenched <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/09/23/unaccompanied-minors-central-america-rushing-across-us-border/90911644/">conflicts</a> — started, in part, because of harmful U.S. policies. Unfortunately, I have found that a lack of empathy between Latin American communities has enabled serious levels of resentment and made the resolution of complicated challenges difficult. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Firstly, those who live in Latin American countries often resent those who have left. Historically, those with economic privilege get the opportunity to leave, as we have seen during periods of mass exodus such as the 1960s in Cuba, the 1980s in El Salvador and today in Puerto Rico, leaving behind the less privileged to deal with the turmoil. In effect, significant animosity exists toward those who claim the Latinx cultural identity without having stuck around to contribute to the rebuilding of Latin America during periods of hardship. That animosity is further inflamed by the fact that the majority of the emigrants from Latin America end up in the United States, the player chiefly responsible for the economic and political problems that force some Latin Americans to flee.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the other hand, Latinx-identifying people in the United States resent this criticism and the de-legitimization of their identity. A significant portion of these people made substantial sacrifices to come to the United States and did so to escape serious dangers, including political persecution or poverty. It is difficult to criticize someone for trying to find better opportunities for themselves and their family. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown is a microcosm of these far-reaching sentiments — a reflection of both the growing Latinx community and the histories and politics that complicate the Latinx identity. On campus, a plethora of organizations — from the Latino Student Initiative that encompasses undergraduates, graduates and alumni, to the newly formed Puerto Rican Association — aim to create a real sense of identity on campus. Since my arrival, I have found my Facebook feed full of invitations to teach-ins, discussion groups and community meetings, all of which reflect the dedication of the Latinx community at Brown. And yet, I personally felt a sense of resentment toward those who I believed misunderstand the realities in Latin America; at the same time, I am sure others have felt the same toward me. I have found that all of these sentiments, while legitimate, have only divided the Latinx community and kept it from discussing the issues that really matter. In the end, I believe it is in the hands of those of us living in the United States, those of us at Brown, to work towards bridging this divide. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Firstly, Latinx-identifying people in the United States need to understand and accept the privilege that we benefit from. This is especially true for those of us at Brown, who have found ourselves in a space perfectly designed for this kind of open discussion. Secondly, we need to use this privilege to exert political influence in favor of non-interventionist, anti-colonial policies. The Latinx community, especially in hubs such as Miami, New York and San Francisco, is becoming an increasingly large voting force in U.S. elections — and this influence can be used to support a better kind of American foreign and commercial policy in Latin America. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lastly, the Latinx community living outside of Latin America must learn to stay grounded in the realities of those who continue to live in the culture that we identify with and who continue to face the issues that we must now discuss. Particularly for those of us at Brown, it is easy to get wrapped up in intellectual conversations that disregard the real people affected by certain discourses. It is time to embrace the political potential of the Latinx community in the U.S. and direct our energy towards the elimination of political and economic exploitation. Our families, our friends and our home countries depend on it. </span></p>

		<title>Liang ’19: Too much tech</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. These companies are everywhere — in our homes and computers, in our schools and on our screens. They’re in places I never imagined they’d be. (Whole Foods? Really? Is nothing sacred?) They make life so, so easy. And, as The Herald’s 127th editorial board recently <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/01/selling-out-to-tech/">explained</a> in an editorial, they have begun to face collective criticism for their lack of oversight. The seeds of this conflict were planted as far back as May, when New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/technology/techs-frightful-five-theyve-got-us.html">labeled</a> the aforementioned companies “tech’s frightful five.” Manjoo warned that the thin veneer of technology’s presupposed social good would eventually conflict with the companies’ overarching power, and here we are!</p>
<p class="p2">Large technology companies make me queasy, not because they aren’t good companies per se, but because their rapid growth and lack of accountability have the potential to cause great harm very quickly. For example, Snapchat has single-handedly gentrified and ruined Venice Beach with the construction of its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-ipo-hqprotest/snap-hq-spoils-community-venice-beach-protesters-say-idUSKBN16934S">new</a> headquarters. Uber, which has always existed on the edge of ethical corporate practices, has started to experiment with self-driving cars on the roads of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ubers-fake-city-pittsburgh-self-driving-cars-2017-10">Pittsburgh</a>. And don’t even get me started on the embarrassment of cities that are shamelessly pimping themselves out as potential <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/13/renshaw-20-letter-dearest-jeff-bezos/">sites</a> for Amazon’s <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/13/renshaw-20-letter-dearest-jeff-bezos/">second</a> headquarters. These companies, by way of money, power and prestige, operate outside of much of the oversight faced by traditional institutions like banks or the government. Too often, the industry is considered too “cool” and revolutionary to interfere with … doubleplusgood indeed. But like any other trend of complacency (remember the housing bubble?), we are finally coming to a reckoning: Tech companies like Facebook and Google have a lot to answer for with regard to their operations during the last election <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tech-companies-find-more-signs-of-russian-election-activity/">cycle</a>, and I’m not happy with their responses so far.</p>
<p class="p2">I’m perhaps even more worried about the nonchalance that tech leaders continue to project even as these problems continue to escalate. Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, for example, still acts as if his headquarters is the greatest thing that has ever <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-not-so-celebratory-reaction-to-snaps-i-p-o-in-its-hometown">happened</a> to the Venice Beach community (cue eye roll). Sure, eventually we can catch up to people like former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who was unceremoniously completely removed from power at Uber last <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/03/technology/business/uber-board-kalanick/index.html">month</a>, but there are so many other leaders in tech who have gone unsupervised and remain remarkably uncaring of criticism. And the industry itself seems tone-deaf to the its critics: I’ve gone to a couple of tech recruiting sessions for the sheer fun of it and the free food, and the number of times I’ve heard the words “synergy,” “connect the world” and “social prerogative” make me groan.</p>
<p class="p2">And I realize the irony of critiquing these companies in a column that I have typed using Microsoft Word on a Macbook Air and with Google as my method of information-gathering. These corporations have done tremendous good — that much is true — but I refuse to use past successes (no matter how revolutionary) to justify ignoring the faults of these companies in the future. If we fall into this trap, we risk creating oligarchies, modern day equivalents of the phone and airline industries, which are universally hated by the public but nevertheless thrive on unchallenged. I will use Facebook all I want, but that does not deprive me of the ability to critique Mark Zuckerberg’s disastrous <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerbergs-failed-100-million-donation-to-newark-public-schools-2015-9">philanthropy</a> attempts in New Jersey or his unchecked funding of misdirected science and education <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/09/21/biohub/">research</a>. In fact, we should feel obligated to turn a critical eye toward these companies and their often questionable decisions.</p>
<p class="p2">This realization is important for everyone on campus, but especially for those who are considering internships and jobs at these companies after a particularly savage recruiting season. Let’s get some things straight: You are not changing the world, no matter what it says on your company T-shirt. Google is not just some hip, cool company operating out of a garage anymore, just as Harvard is not just some college in Cambridge. These companies have an army of public relations specialists and lawyers to make you feel special and important, to make you feel needed, so that they can scoop up your talent for their bottom line. But despite the massive demand for computer science professionals in the United States right now, what we really need is more ethical computer scientists. By ethical, I mean those who have the ability to discern for themselves the quality of their work and the consequence <span class="s1">of their actions, rather than enter a mindless white-collar work culture. This morality is absolutely necessary, or else we end up with companies like Uber <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/technology/uber-federal-inquiry-software-greyball.html">using</a> advanced software to deceive and evade regulators. Tech is not necessarily a salvation, no matter how many people say it is.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A recent graphic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/technology/techs-frightful-five-theyve-got-us.html">illustration</a> in the New York Times depicts a phone-wielding passenger at sea, stranded on rafts featuring the logos of these five companies. This image tells us all we need to know about the current state of the tech industry. Right now, the public views these companies positively, but their power and influence mean that any one of them has the capacity to hold us hostage, just like the phone companies and airline conglomerates before them. That’s not to say it’s too late to do anything. These companies are still led by smart, capable people, who should be able to read between the lines and change their policies while there is still time. They’re hiring from Brown, which means there have to be at least a few good apples in the ruthless recruiting pipeline. The only alternative to changing from within is government regulation, and that is a war I can’t even begin to fathom. Let’s not go there, shall we?</span></p>

		<title>Richardson &#039;20: Why Brown should require DIAP courses</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A year and a half ago, President Christina Paxson P’19 released the University’s landmark Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan. The plan has six designated categories: people, academic excellence, curriculum, community, knowledge and accountability. The University has demonstrated commitment to several of these areas. It has actively tried to recruit a diverse group of faculty and graduate students, supported a range of campus life centers including the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-diversity/pathways/implementation/community">Brown Center for Students of Color</a> and the First Generation College and Low-Income Student Center and <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-diversity/pathways/implementation/accountability">published regular progress reports</a> to hold itself accountable.</p>
<p class="p2">But less attention has been paid to two categories that are especially relevant to the student learning experience — academic excellence and curriculum. These two categories specifically aim to introduce inclusive, socially aware and diverse ideas into our academic discourse. By extension, it seems only fitting for the DIAP to also require all undergraduate students to take at least one race, gender and sexuality, inequality or social justice-related course during their four years at Brown. This requirement would build on the potential of the DIAP by not only reaffirming the importance of diversity in the community, but also prioritizing diverse perspectives in academia.</p>
<p class="p2">Currently, Brown has Diverse Perspectives in Liberal Learning courses that <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/DIAPcourses">aim</a> to “expose and critique the diverse historical and cultural forces that shape the construction of knowledge in all disciplines.” These courses are searchable via Courses@Brown under the acronym “DPLL.” However, by next fall, this will be replaced with a new searchable acronym: “<a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/DIAPcourses">DIAP</a>.” Even though these courses are labeled and easy to find online, the designation itself doesn’t ensure that students who arguably need to take the courses most — students who have not had access to these conversations and modes of thought before coming to Brown — actually do so. This is precisely where a DIAP-mandated course requirement could help.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown has been historically considered a liberal institution that allows students to craft our degrees in ways that suit us best — something we don’t see in many other universities. It strives to place more value on the process of learning during class time and long thereafter, and does not place undue importance on grades or other markers of achievement. DIAP courses fit into this model because they provide us with knowledge that is not only useful to our academic growth, but also to our ongoing engagement with the world around us. Thus, a requirement for all students to take at least one DIAP-designated course would allow Brown to promote diverse thinking among all of its future graduates, instead of only the select few who opt in to these courses voluntarily.</p>
<p class="p2">Plus, it’s more important than ever that students understand how to maneuver the complex maze that is the current political climate. Educating students on the reality around us — say, the gender pay gap or the racial disparities in arrests and sentencing — will position them to be more informed and better able to conduct themselves in a rapidly changing and liberalizing world. In our polarized political moment, when a sitting president has been caught on tape bragging about sexual assault and has refused to unequivocally denounce the neo-Nazi groups that wreaked havoc on Charlottesville in August, it is imperative that all students emerge from Brown as informed, ethical citizens and voters. Ensuring that they engage, at least once, with the type of material covered in DIAP courses is one way to further this end.</p>
<p class="p2">One obvious concern with any curricular requirement at Brown is that it infringes on the Open Curriculum. Yes, this openness is important because it allows students the flexibility to take a broad range of courses within and outside of their disciplines while remaining on track to graduate. But the DIAP graduation requirement would work in a similar way to the already existing writing requirement, which does not undercut the integrity of the Open Curriculum. The writing requirement was mandated because the ability to write was seen as a basic life skill — but so is understanding the social context around us. If anything, undervaluing this critical life skill would be a disservice to students, who will need this knowledge moving forward. And, unlike the writing requirement,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a DIAP requirement could be just one course over eight semesters, which isn’t asking very much. And considering that diversity and inclusion are of the utmost importance across all disciplines, it will be easy for the computer scientist, art historian and physicist alike to find DIAP courses that intersect with their academic interests.</p>
<p class="p2">I applaud the University for undertaking an ambitious plan toward diversity and inclusion — but a simple curricular change would make it more effective and possibly serve as a template for other universities to follow. Simply allowing DIAP courses to be searchable via Courses@Brown is not enough; if students are not obligated to look for them, labeling courses as “DIAP” adds virtually nothing to the inclusion and awareness that the University seeks to promote with the designation. With all due respect to what is, in essence, a strong and thoughtful plan for the University to engage with diversity, the longevity and productivity of the current DIAP pale in comparison to what they could be. The five-year plan is a great start, but its mission of diversity and inclusion can live on for decades more if each future graduate is required to take a DIAP course to graduate.</p>

		<title>Cardoso &#039;19: Democrats, don’t let Virginia get your hopes up</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Last Tuesday, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, Ralph Northam, raced to victory by a healthy margin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This result was not particularly surprising: Though his opponent, Ed Gillespie, mounted an unexpected comeback in the final weeks of the campaign, Virginians have increasingly voted for Democratic candidates in statewide elections. Virginia currently has a Democratic governor and two Democratic senators, and in 2016, Hillary Clinton took the state by a solid margin of five percentage points. But you wouldn’t be able to tell just how predictable this outcome was based on the immediate reactions to Northam’s victory. “The American suburbs appear to be in revolt against President Trump,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>New York Times reporters Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/us/politics/suburbs-revolt-trump-republicans-congress.html">proclaimed</a>. “The GOP should be scared by Virginia,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/opinion/virginia-election-democrats-northam-gillespie.html">wrote</a> New York Times columnist Frank Bruni. In the days following the election, there was no paucity of observers predicting that Trumpism was in full retreat. Yet this claim was based on nothing more than several Democratic wins — including the elections of Danica Roem and Chris Hurst — in this already Democratic-leaning state.</p>
<p class="p3">In fact, the results are not necessarily the national repudiation of Trump that liberals hope to see. It is entirely possible the election results in Virginia merely reflect the <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/population-projections-virginia-expected-become-10th-largest-state-2040">shifting demographics</a> and urbanization of the state. While Northam won the cities and their suburbs by remarkable margins, he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/democrats-virginia-jersey-victory.html">decimated</a> outside of the metropolises by margins larger than those of his predecessor, Democrat Gov. Terry McAuliffe, in 2013. It is also important to note that Gillespie gained significant ground in polls after he embraced the rhetoric of the Trump administration — not exactly a unequivocal rejection of the president’s views on the part of Virginian voters. The fact that these points were largely missing from the discourse surrounding the race is indicative of a larger problem in many liberal circles. The issue, particularly for Democrats, is that our discourse on national politics has become increasingly reductive, as each election is treated as a definitive referendum on Trump and his appeal.</p>
<p class="p3">This phenomenon is not limited to just Virginia. Take, for instance, the national attention given to the Georgia special election for former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price’s old seat in the House of Representatives in June. Democratic party leaders, media outlets and voters alike treated the race as a measure of public attitudes toward Trump. For example, before the election, the Huffington Post ran an article entitled <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-georgia-special-election-is-make-or-break-for-democrats_us_5946c83fe4b0d188d027ff92">“The Georgia Special Election Is Make-Or-Break For Democrats.”</a> This article, and others like it, implied that a loss for Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff would be a sign that Trump’s policies were resonating with voters nationwide. This race solicited the most donations of any House race in history; clearly, party leaders and voters in other states felt that victory in one small, non-competitive district in Georgia was essential to their success in future elections. But it wasn’t. In fact, Ossoff did lose — and this is no real predictor of the Democratic Party’s electoral prospects in 2018. Ossoff was a weak candidate running for a seat that Democrats had not won in decades. A rational and measured analysis of the race would conclude that Ossoff was a long shot, not that his defeat reflects national acceptance of Trump. This knee-jerk reaction — treating each election as a stand-alone litmus test for Trump’s popularity without paying any attention to context or other factors — has come to dominate our political discourse.</p>
<p class="p3">It is important that our political dialogue be more than just narrow, wishful thinking that could misinform voters and warp electoral outcomes. Such an approach to political analysis turns almost any Republican defeat into a shock and almost any Democratic victory into a decisive disavowal of the other side. This is dangerous for Democratic hopes in 2018 because it may lure voters into complacency and consequently depress voter turnout — especially if voters take recent Democratic wins as a signal that Democrats are sure to succeed in 2018, and they decide not to engage in the electoral process.</p>
<p class="p3">In reality, this belies some very serious structural disadvantages that Democrats face. Rampant gerrymandering has made certain seats in the House practically unattainable for liberal candidates. Democrats are not winning among educated suburban voters by the margins necessary to reclaim the competitive seats they would need to retake the House. And Democrats are defending 25 of 33 seats in the Senate, 10 of which are in states won by Trump. Yet if the dominant narrative continues to suggest that Trumpism is dead and that Democrats are on the path to glorious triumph, then voters may be less inclined to turn out. This mentality is exactly the opposite of what Democrats need from citizens to succeed in 2018.</p>
<p class="p3">Of course, some complex and informative dialogue still exists. But at a time when the basic precepts of politics are in question and the forces that motivated Trump voters in 2016 remain unclear, our political dialogue needs careful and nuanced analyses, not facile prophesying.</p>

		<title>Savello &#039;18: Is STEM growth hurting the humanities?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2017, 144 Brown students — 7.7 percent of the Class of 2017 — graduated with <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-research/factbook/degrees-and-completions">computer science degrees</a>. This was a drastic increase from just nine years ago, when only 34 graduating seniors concentrated in computer science. Similarly, 100 students completed an engineering degree this year compared to just 54 in 2008. The staggering growth in engineering and computer science graduates stands in sharp contrast to the large declines in many humanities departments: The history of art and architecture department, for example, had a graduating class of 76 in 2008 but only 12 concentrators in 2017, while the religious studies department saw its concentrators drop from 24 to just five in the same time frame.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Course enrollment data show similar trends, which means that even non-concentrators are choosing to take more courses in science and engineering fields and fewer in the humanities. This tendency is not unique to Brown: Computer science and engineering have attracted more majors on a national scale in <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_322.10.asp?current=yes">recent years</a> due to technological advancements and the growing national demand for these skills. At the same time, many humanities departments — particularly smaller ones — have seen declining student participation. Given the University’s historical emphasis on a multifaceted education, this pattern has serious implications for Brown’s structural and curricular model — implications that administrators should consider going forward in the digital age.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the one hand, this shift in enrollment and concentrators can help Brown achieve the goals laid out in President Christina Paxson’s P’19 strategic plan, “Building on Distinction.” The plan extended previous efforts to shift away from the university-college model of Brown’s past to a research-university structure. The growth in STEM departments could facilitate this shift by drawing in additional research funding and attracting high-profile faculty to the school. Increasing enrollment in departments such as computer science and engineering could also strengthen these departments ­— which have historically received less attention than the humanities — and improve Brown’s research profile. Moreover, it is important to note that STEM fields are not antithetical to a liberal arts education. In fact, bolstering these areas of study can complement Brown’s mission to provide students with a well-rounded education in many disciplines, particularly in a world where technology and science are becoming an integral part of our social and economic infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the other hand, this shift could drastically recast Brown’s focus on liberal learning. The University has historically <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/curriculum">emphasized</a> the importance of an education that prioritizes both “breadth and depth: basic knowledge in a range of disciplines, focused by more concentrated work in one.” While this curricular model is an essential element of Brown’s identity, our continued focus on a liberal arts education is critical for reasons beyond tradition. A liberal education provides a solid grounding in a range of different skills that students can carry with them into the workforce, including communication, collaboration and the ability to embrace diversity and build bridges with people from different backgrounds. These skills are vital — even in an economy that increasingly relies on science and technology — but they can only be developed through engagement in a multitude of departments. However, as more students enter STEM fields that often have many prerequisites and requirements to satisfy, Brown will see fewer students take advantage of the Open Curriculum and emerge with a strong grounding in liberal arts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition, the rapid influx of students into a few STEM concentrations can overwhelm those departments. More worryingly, the decreasing enrollment of students in many humanities concentrations — often those with the least funding — could well result in even fewer resources spent on these departments. Logically, if fewer students concentrate in certain fields, the departments will begin to receive less funding, harming not only their educational capacity, but also their ability to conduct research and attract more faculty and graduate students. We are already beginning to see this in the University’s resource allocation decisions: The engineering department has just unveiled its new Engineering Research Center, while many humanities departments are still housed in aging, cramped buildings. This is a reasonable response to both national trends and student preferences, but comes at the cost of the small, niche <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/07/university-struggles-keep-ai-industry-booms/">departments</a> fundamental to a well-rounded liberal arts education.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With the rise of technology, it is inevitable that more students will drift toward departments like computer science and engineering. These shifts could arguably better prepare students for careers in a tech-oriented world. Ultimately, however, the University needs to balance this growth with a continued commitment to the emphasis on liberal learning objectives that put it on the map in the first place. If not, we risk compromising the fundamental spirit of a Brown education. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For the last year, I have struggled to come to terms with how someone with a long history of denigrating and objectifying women could rise to the highest office in the land. President Trump has bragged about sexually assaulting women on camera; commodified and disrespected women — including teenage girls — when he was owner of the <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/timeline-of-trumps-creepiness-while-he-owned-miss-universe-w444634">Miss Universe Organization</a>; and allegedly harassed or assaulted 16 women <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/16-women-or-donald-trump-who-would-you-believe/">since the 1970s</a>. Each of these accusations should have been disqualifying for any office, let alone the presidency. So how could voters know all of this and still elect him? How could the American political system lack a check against the election of abusive men?</p>
<p class="p2">Well, the discourse around recent sexual assault allegations involving other politicians could offer a clue. With the emergence of the #MeToo campaign, many more political figures have been accused of sexual harassment and misconduct, including former President George H.W. Bush, U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore and now U.S. Senator Al Franken, D-Minn. Yet their supporters have generally condoned their behavior and politicized sexual assault. In this context, Trump isn’t an exception — he is the product of a system that has consistently excused the transgressions of powerful men.</p>
<p class="p2">Even before Trump, several formal presidents have been credibly accused of sexual assault or misconduct — and have been forgiven by the public thereafter. Thomas Jefferson <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/sally-hemings-wasnt-thomas-jeffersons-mistress-she-was-his-property/2017/07/06/db5844d4-625d-11e7-8adc-fea80e32bf47_story.html">reportedly</a> raped Sally Hemings, an enslaved woman and his teenage daughter’s companion, for years. Today, his face is carved onto the side of Mount Rushmore and cast on our currency. Grover Cleveland <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/grover-clevelands-sex-scandal-the-most-despicable-in-american-political-history">allegedly</a> raped the mother of his child, Maria Halpin, according to an affidavit she filed at the time. Today, he is <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/02/15/presidents-day-grover-cleveland-most-honest-president-them-all/CmhndHa3aA1t0cvAfjB6LL/story.html">known</a> as “Grover the good” and “the most honest president of them all.” And Ronald Reagan was accused of date-raping actress Selene Walters in the 1950s. He is still remembered fondly by Republicans — and even many Democrats — as one of the most popular presidents in modern history.</p>
<p class="p2">Then, of course, there is Bill Clinton, accused of assaulting four women and engaging in an inappropriate sexual relationship with an intern who worked under him. Despite tale after tale of misconduct, liberals were quick to come to his defense and vilify the women who spoke out against him. Today, he is still considered a Democratic icon and — incredibly — a champion for women’s rights. So, by all accounts, we have sent many exploitive and abusive men to the White House before Trump — we have just refused to acknowledge it.</p>
<p class="p2">This culture of impunity extends well beyond the White House. Last week, over 50 congressional staffers <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/14/politics/sexual-harassment-congress/index.html">came forward</a> to accuse male lawmakers of sexual harassment. Female staffers allegedly kept an informal “creep list” of the most notorious men and claimed that the power dynamic between aides and legislators discouraged women from speaking out. Even worse, Congress has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/16/politics/settlements-congress-sexual-harassment/index.html">paid out</a> potentially millions of dollars in settlements to survivors of sexual harassment and discrimination at the hands of lawmakers. The fact that taxpayer money has actually been used to shield legislators from the consequences of their actions — and in many cases, buy the silence of women — is a testament to just how complicit our political system is.</p>
<p class="p2">And this isn’t just a problem with national politics. Similar stories have emerged from state legislatures across the country, including in Rhode Island. Last month, R.I. Rep. Teresa Tanzi ’07, D-Narragansett and South Kingstown, <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171016/ri-lawmakers-share-metoo-revelations-of-sexual-assault-harassment">alleged</a> that senior state legislators offered to support her bills in exchange for “sexual favors.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lawmakers in other states, including <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/10/27/the-stories-sexual-harassment-beacon-hill-are-overwhelming/0a4T5VADqH9ffipiXfpwGO/story.html">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/texas-guv-moves-to-end-sexual-harassment-at-state-capitol-after-daily-beast-expose">Texas</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-harassment-legislatures/chorus-of-sexual-harassment-allegations-spreads-among-u-s-statehouses-idUSKBN1D9338">Minnesota</a>, have also experienced rampant objectification, harassment and discrimination. At every level of our political process, we have allowed sexual misconduct to continue unchallenged — and we now have to live with the results.</p>
<p class="p2">It is encouraging that policymakers are finally beginning to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/two-female-members-of-congress-speak-out-about-sexual-harassment-training/">take action</a> against sexual harassment in politics, both nationally and at the state level. But if we truly wish to address sexual misconduct in the highest echelons of our democracy, we need to first confront the complicity of a system that has continuously shielded powerful men from the consequences of their actions. We are long overdue for such a reckoning, because this problem is more than just about Trump, Moore, Clinton or any other contemporary political figure that comes to mind. It’s about a political culture that has neglected sexual violence and silenced women for centuries. Until we recognize that, any policy solution will be little more than a Band-Aid over a gaping wound.</p>

		<title>Oke ’20: Defining blackness in college admissions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We attend a university that is obsessed with the optics of our black and brown faces, but is indifferent to the justice we seek,” wrote Cornell University’s Black Students United. After reading that statement I thought to myself, “Don’t we all?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most of us have heard about the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, Brown’s attempt at increasing minority representation in the University’s faculty and student bodies. And while the plan has potential for success, perhaps its most egregious shortcoming is its failure to differentiate between students who are black and those who are African-American. Consequently, there are no provisions to ensure that historically disadvantaged black folks within the United States will receive some of the restitution that they deserve. If the University truly seeks to build a more inclusive community, then it must make an effort to acknowledge the plurality of the black experience in America.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In September of this year, Black Students United, an organization for students at Cornell who identify with the African diaspora, presented a list of demands for the advancement of black and brown students. Among the most notable of these demands was a push for the admissions board to increase the presence of underrepresented black students on Cornell’s <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/28/black-student-group-complains-ivy-league-school-is-letting-in-too-many-african-students/">campus</a> . The group further defined “underrepresented Black students as Black Americans who have several generations (more than two) in this country.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’ve often wondered how we should define blackness and who should have the power to do so. Black Students United essentially required their school’s administration to not only acknowledge that there are different types of blackness in America, but also to cater to a specific group within the larger umbrella group of black Americans. But how does one tell the difference between a black American and an African-American? The answer usually differs depending on who you talk to. In my understanding, the term African-American refers to black folks whose families have lived in the United States since the time of the Atlantic slave trade. Black American, on the other hand, can mean anyone residing in the United States who is grouped as black based on their skin color.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These definitions stem from my own experiences, though, and while we could sit around for months discussing the complexity of the black identity in the United States, what good would that actually do? Most people don’t see a visual difference between an African immigrant and an African-American person descended from slavery — they just see blackness. So, some may ask, why waste our energy bickering amongst ourselves to decide who is more oppressed than whom? It seems to many that by distinguishing between different types of blackness, groups like Black Students United will only further divide black communities and undermine the goals of solidarity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, we must dispel the common belief that policies like the DIAP and affirmative action have been successful in assisting those from historically disadvantaged backgrounds. Take a look at Brown’s campus: Many black students at this university are of direct African descent, meaning that either their parents or they themselves emigrated to the United States from an African country. Even more interesting is the fact that oftentimes, these students (myself included) are Nigerian. A 2014 opinions piece in the New York Times stated that although they account for less than 1 percent of America’s black population, Nigerians make up almost a <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/opinion/sunday/what-drives-success.html">quarter</a> of all of the black students at Harvard Business School. And while only 11 percent of white Americans have a graduate degree, over a fourth of Nigerian-Americans hold that same qualification.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is important for us to realize that people of the modern African diaspora (i.e., mid-20th century onwards) did not have to suffer through American slavery, Jim Crow segregation, redlining, voter suppression or any of the other horrible circumstances under which African-Americans have lived for centuries. The sad truth is that through the “positive discrimination” policies meant to correct these atrocities, over-performing African students have benefitted at the cost of their less privileged African-American counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But when the Common App asks an applicant to indicate their race, the Black/African-American checkbox takes none of these nuances into account. The result is exactly what you see on Brown’s campus: a disproportionately large number of high-achieving (and often financially privileged) first or second generation African students, lumped together with a handful of African-American students. If affirmative action worked the way it was intended — to “end and correct the effects of a specific form of discrimination” — these statistics would surely be reversed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Until that time comes, we must begin to see blackness for what it is: an arbitrary concept invented for the convenience of white supremacists. On top of that, we must also begin to see blackness for what it can become. Blackness as I’ve known it can be a movement, a musical genre, a death sentence, a community, a blessing and a curse. There is no one way to be black — blackness is beautiful because it has no limits. Therefore, we deserve to be seen by the University not as a collective group that needs saving, but as unique individuals, each with our own personal struggles, surviving and thriving in a world that constantly tries to box us in.</span></p>

		<title>Thomas &#039;21: Rethinking who our veterans are</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last summer, I heard a Vietnam War veteran speak at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington, D.C. He talked about his experiences in the war and the hardships he experienced in Vietnam. But it was what he experienced upon returning to the United States that was the toughest part of the war for him. He described returning home to people spitting on him and having chairs thrown at him. Granted, the Vietnam War was highly controversial, but in this instance, frustration with the war was horribly misplaced. The veteran urged the audience to learn to “separate the war from the warrior.” While the political context of the Vietnam War was substantially different from the wars the United States has fought in the 21st century, his emotional plea still rings true: Today, there’s a significant disconnect between how Americans see veterans and the actual, lived experiences of veterans. If we really want to demonstrate our gratitude for the sacrifices of Americans in uniform, we ought to re-examine our immediate perceptions of veterans and do more to consider their lives and struggles away from the battlefield. Only then can we pursue policies and programs that make veterans’ lives better and properly repay them for their valor.</span></p>
<p class="p2">First, it is easy to assume that our veterans voluntarily joined the military out of an extreme sense of patriotism or nationalism. But this is not always the case. Take Phoebe Gavin, a U.S. Army veteran, as an example. “I grew up in a dead-end town where there were no opportunities,” she <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/what-made-you-join-the-mi_b_1851023.html">wrote on Quora</a>. She knew that joining the military would provide her with educational aid and free health care. These things were important for her because her parents were poor and she could only stay on her parents’ insurance if she went to school, which she couldn’t afford. Gavin wrote that she didn’t have the stereotypical inspiration to serve “God and country” that is often projected onto all veterans. Her motives for enlisting were inextricably linked to her well-being and livelihood. Similarly, Jon Mixon, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, cited the poor economy of 1984 and described his motivation for enlisting simply: “I needed a job,” he <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/what-made-you-join-the-mi_b_1851023.html">wrote on Quora</a>. People join the military for various reasons, and oftentimes it’s because it presents itself as the best option out there. This idea is only augmented by the countless number of military recruitment commercials that occupy our television and movie screens on a regular basis. While some of us may have the privilege to not bat an eye at such ads, others don’t have that privilege. For many Americans, military service is an instrument of social mobility — a key way to get ahead.</p>
<p class="p2">Second, for many veterans, the war doesn’t stop when they come home. Viral videos of children and pets running toward returning soldiers present only the brief, joyful moments of homecoming, while ignoring the internal struggles that quietly harm veterans in the long run. Veterans often face serious mental health challenges after their service, as the 2007 study “Bringing the War Back Home” found. The study looked at 103,788 American veterans treated at Veterans Affairs facilities after tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and found that 25 percent of these veterans received a mental health diagnosis, 56 percent received two or more mental health diagnoses and 31 percent overall received mental health or psychosocial diagnoses. These mental health challenges can, in turn, contribute to veterans’ inability to adapt to civilian life and find housing and employment; every night, close to 40,000 veterans are <a href="http://nchv.org/index.php/news/media/background_and_statistics/">homeless</a>. Simply put, war is traumatic and profoundly detrimental to the lives of those who serve.</p>
<p class="p2">Third, the deployments that servicemen and servicewomen must go on keep them away from their families for long periods of time — and that distance can have real, tangible consequences for relationships. When I was three years old, I went half a year without seeing my mom while she was actively serving in the Army. When she came home, she, my grandma and I went to Disney World. Despite going to the “The Most Magical Place on Earth,” it was not a memorable experience for me. The only thing I really remember from that day is treating my own mother as a stranger. I hadn’t seen her in so long that I’d come to see my grandma as my actual mom. While my mom likes to laugh about it now, I know it wasn’t easy for her to grapple with having her own child not recognize her. It’s one thing to acknowledge intellectually that veterans give up a lot to serve their country. But it’s a different thing to really put yourself in the shoes of Americans in uniform and their loved ones — to confront the difficulty of keeping in touch with your children or your parents thousands of miles away.</p>
<p class="p2">All this is to say that veterans deserve our respect — real, thoughtful and empathetic respect. A few weeks ago, student veteran John McCrillis ’17.5 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/12/u-increases-support-resources-student-veterans/">told</a> The Herald that, “A lot of veterans get stuck in this mold of being a veteran, and that’s all they’ll ever be. I didn’t want to have a war story be my definition of my character or who I am.” “Veteran” is a more complex identifier than you might think, and it’s important to explore the complexity of experiences it umbrellas before passing judgement or assuming that an entire group fits into a narrow stereotype. Respect doesn’t mean saying “thank you for your service” to every vet you see. But it does mean that we, as Americans, need to recognize the multidimensionality of the veteran experience.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I was in pre-K, each parent was responsible for bringing in some sort of treat once per school year for the entire class. Hard at work at the nearby hospital, my mother, a practicing pathologist for many years, completely forgot about this parental duty by the time my day rolled around. Remembering just a few hours beforehand and not having the time nor the know-how to bake, she ran to our local grocery store, bought a few boxes of cookies, threw them in some containers, shook them around a little bit and passed them off as homemade. My mom always finishes telling this story by reminding her listeners that she was one of only two working mothers in my pre-K class — and that was why she couldn’t be as involved. However, by pursuing her career throughout my childhood, my mom did more for me than she could ever have done by staying home. Broadly speaking, the choice between having a career and being a loving, caring parent is a false one: Working professionals — specifically, working mothers — are just as capable of raising bright and well-adjusted children.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My mom, like many other working mothers, sometimes feels guilty that she wasn’t home more when I was younger. In a major <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/24/having-a-working-mother-works-for-daughters">study</a>, Harvard researchers found that working mothers “often internalize social messages of impending doom for their children.” Many harmful <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/110066-8-stereotypes-about-working-mothers-we-need-to-abolish">stereotypes</a> about working mothers — including the ideas that they don’t pay enough attention to family, they are unreliable or their children end up resenting them — specifically reinforce this feeling. It’s time these antiquated ideas come to face reality.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s true that many of my fondest childhood memories are with a caregiver I had for many years — not my mother or my father — and I spent a lot of time reading, watching Cyberchase and playing Club Penguin alone. While it might have been nice to do many of these activities with my mother, her absence didn’t severely damage me. It didn’t even come close. She had her own career to focus on, one that she had put decades of work into and was passionate about. She was still a meaningful part of my life: She’d cook dinner and eat with me, take me to birthday parties on weekends and work so that I was able to have food on the table, wear new clothes each school year and eventually go to the college of my choice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Studies have shown that having a working mother can actually benefit young girls. According to Kathleen McGinn, a Harvard Business School professor who has conducted research about working mothers, “there are very few things that have such a clear effect on gender inequality as being raised by a working mother.” Her <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/kids-benefit-from-having-a-working-mom">findings</a>, which hold true across 24 countries, demonstrate that women with working mothers are more likely to have jobs themselves and earn higher wages than women whose mothers stayed home full-time. In addition, children of women who work more than 35 hours per week are more likely to pursue higher education. Further, there seem to be no differences in behavior among teenage children of working mothers versus those of stay-at-home moms. A <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11130051/The-case-for-working-mothers-your-kids-will-be-just-fine.html">study</a> by Silvia Mendolia, an economics lecturer at Australia’s University of Wollongong, found that a mother’s decision to work has no effect on her teenage children’s self-esteem, likelihood of dropping out of high school, satisfaction with life or propensity to smoke. It seems that children of mothers who work a lot actually turn out just fine.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, there are plenty of scenarios in which having a stay-at-home parent makes complete sense. My parents were lucky enough that they could afford childcare for me, but many are not. Having siblings can add to the equation (I’m an only child), and some children have certain needs that make it necessary to have a parent at home. However, in my mother’s position, continuing to work after I was born was the best choice she could have made for me. Often, people say that they stopped working or worked less because they had their child’s best interests at heart. That’s exactly the reason my mom kept working so hard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My mom inspires me so much. She’s extremely competent and has achieved so much in a male-dominated field. It’s no surprise that working mothers are role models who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/24/having-a-working-mother-works-for-daughters">motivate</a> their children to follow suit. My mom exemplifies so much of what I hope to be, and I’m so thankful that she continued to work. Watching her work hard and pursue her passions is what inspires me to work hard and pursue my own.</span></p>

		<title>Mulligan &#039;19: Brown should increase LGBTQ+ course offerings</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/28/mulligan-19-brown-increase-lgbtq-course-offerings/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Earlier this month, California <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-lgbt-textbooks-20171113-story.html">approved</a> textbooks that include LGBTQ+ history for use in public schools for grades K-12. I’m enthused to see California addressing this material because in high school, I generally had to aggressively search to find people like me in the curriculum. LGBTQ+ voices were almost entirely absent in my elementary and middle school education.</p>
<p class="p2">I assumed that when I got to Brown, that reputed bastion of progressivism, I would have an easier time finding LGBTQ+ topics in my education. I was wrong. Brown has a reputation for being a campus friendly to LGBTQ+ people, and in a lot of ways, it is. But very few courses focus on LGBTQ+ subjects, leaving room for considerable improvement as Brown goes about <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-diversity/pathways/implementation/curriculum">implementing</a> the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan in the curriculum. According to The Herald’s <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/series/poll">poll data</a> from the last two years, about 20% of students identify as not heterosexual. LGBTQ+ people aren’t taught our stories growing up — the history we’ve made and the books we’ve written. We deserve a chance to learn our heritage, to learn who we are.</p>
<p class="p2">To see if there really is a lack of LGBTQ+ content in Brown’s classes, I searched course descriptions for keywords relating to gender and sexuality in Brown’s <a href="https://cab.brown.edu/">online course catalogue</a>. The search covered all semesters for the 2017-18 school year. I did not include canceled courses. My results are below:</p>
<p class="p2">“lesbian:” 2 courses</p>
<p class="p2">“gay:” 3 courses</p>
<p class="p2">“bisexual:” 0 courses</p>
<p class="p2">“trans” (used specifically as an abbreviation for “transgender”): 3 courses</p>
<p class="p2">“transgender:” 0 courses</p>
<p class="p2">“queer:” 7 courses</p>
<p class="p2">The terms “gender” and “sexuality” had around 140 and 60 results, respectively. I don’t mean to dismiss those numbers, as I’m sure many of those classes do include LGBTQ+ topics. However, I hesitate to place much weight on them. It’s also worth mentioning that the courses listed for specific identities are not exclusive of one another — the two courses that contain “lesbian” in their description are also two of the three courses including the word “gay.” Actually reading some of the descriptions for courses whose descriptions include “gender” and/or “sexuality” drives home the point that these subjects aren’t central to the material being covered. The description for DEVL 1803R: “Bringing Small States in,” showed up in my search because it listed the following as topics of discussion: “issues in governance, migration, climate change, food security, sports and culture, gender and sexuality, among others.” Gender and sexuality are two topics among many, not the focus of the course.</p>
<p class="p2">Another issue is that talking about gender or sexuality isn’t the same as talking about LGBTQ+ subjects. HIST 0522O: “The Enlightenment,” includes “gender relations” in the list of ideas that the readings cover, but examining gender relations between men and women does not imply that LGBTQ+-related material will be addressed.</p>
<p class="p2">“Gender” and “sexuality” are therefore not necessarily indicators of LGBTQ+ content, let alone a course actually centered around these identities. It’s reasonable to conclude, then, that at Brown, one of those liberal havens where students are supposedly being indoctrinated with radical ideas, there are very few LGBTQ+-focused courses, at least for 2017-18.</p>
<p class="p2">I don’t believe that LGBTQ+ topics are so niche that asking for their inclusion is unreasonable. The history department can have courses as specific as HIST 1820B: “Environmental History of East Asia” and HIST 1977B: “Feathery Things: An Avian Introduction to Animal Studies,” yet there are no courses which are dedicated to LGBTQ+ histories. In the English department, there are two courses in the 2017-18 year about J. R. R. Tolkien, but not a single class dedicated to LGBTQ+ literature.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In fairness to the English department, they have previously offered a course called “Queer Relations: Aesthetics and Sexuality,” which of course included LGBTQ+ authors. But what they haven’t offered, at least in the time I’ve been at Brown, is a course not bogged down with theory: with Butler and Barthes, and sentences that stretch on for miles while explaining some convoluted academic idea that has no applicability to real life — I’ve never seen a course that just explores LGBTQ+ writing in a way that’s accessible for folks who aren’t English concentrators (or for those like me, who just aren’t into theory).</span></p>
<p class="p2">It’s frustrating to have to continue to build space for the content I want to study. I include LGBTQ+ content in many of the final papers or projects that I complete for classes that aren’t specifically LGBTQ+-related. But it would be nice if there were more classes dedicated to subject matter that’s central to the identities of many Brown students, and which is increasingly relevant as LGBTQ+ people become more and more visible to a society that has historically excluded us.</p>

		<title>Vilsan ’19: There is no ideal feminist</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1992, Hillary Clinton infamously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-cookies.html">stated</a> that she “could have stayed home and baked cookies” but decided instead to fulfill the profession she chose before her husband entered public life. The quote has haunted her ever since, and although Clinton spent weeks apologizing for the perceived insensitivity of her comments, some women have found it hard to move past. At Brown, I am surrounded every day by empowered, ambitious and intelligent women who plan to — and likely will — succeed as high-achieving professionals, mothers and wives all at once. But it is also important to respect the fact that some women at Brown may look forward to pursuing marital and familial goals instead of professional ones. Nearly 26 years later, the condescension expressed by Clinton still persists: The feminist woman is supposed to seek professional advancement in tandem with a strong personal life — anything else is deemed insufficient. But that ideal does not always describe the path that female students at Brown hope to pursue. It’s about time we start treating the feminist movement for what it is — a movement for female equality, not a hierarchy of female merit based on professional achievement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have frequently overheard female students talking down to their peers who don’t plan on pursuing lifelong careers, asserting that an Ivy League education would be a waste of money if not used in a professional capacity. For example, at a recent recruiting event, female attendees discussed the often-difficult choice women face between balancing the professional with the personal or choosing between the two. Upon listening to one of the guest speakers — a successful woman in the banking industry who<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>pushed back her marriage into her late 30s to focus on her professional goals — many students chimed in with their own opinions on the matter. And the overwhelming consensus was strikingly similar to Clinton’s statement in the early 1990s: True feminists pursue their professional goals unapologetically, and work to maintain healthy relationships and families in harmony with their careers. And while many female graduates from Brown do just that, there are also countless women who choose instead to focus on non-professional pursuits unapologetically. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown prides itself on being a liberal institution that promotes gender equality and encourages all students to follow their own paths. As such, women at Brown shatter glass ceilings upon graduation left and right. But embracing traditional roles does not mean that you have accepted to live under the glass ceiling that feminists before you have worked to destroy. It simply means that you value familial goals, like raising children, above professional ones. And while some women are able to harmonize their work and family lives, others make a choice. Pursuing an Ivy League education should not restrict or pressure women into professional roles that they do not wish to undertake. After all, there is such a thing as education for the sake of personal growth and academic interest. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Feminists, by definition, advocate for a woman’s right to determine the course of her own life — whether the path leads to clocking in 100-hour workweeks in a competitive industry or to becoming a full-time mother and wife. If we champion one and demean the other, we are not truly feminists. We are condescending to those women whose priorities do not align with our own. It is always spurring for me, as a Brown student, to continue to hear women putting each other down for making decisions that may not necessarily conform with the feminist ideal. Ultimately, we cannot claim to be feminists if we do not respect women’s choices, professional or otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of Brown’s most notable alums, Janet Yellen ’67, is understandably an inspirational figure for many young women walking through the Van Wickle Gates. As one of the most powerful figures in the world today, she has distinguished herself as a scholar and successful chair of the Federal Reserve, all the while being an excellent wife and mother. But her life isn’t and shouldn’t be the only example of success for female students. There are countless female alums who have graduated from Brown and gone on to build strong families instead of pursuing careers, and it is perfectly valid to be inspired by their paths as well. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before I left campus first semester freshmen year, I got my cartilage pierced. For those of you who don’t conform to the true-rebel lifestyle this implies, “getting my cartilage pierced” refers to the life-altering moment of a shiny needle and a shinier stone sliding into the upper crevice of my left ear. It was so crazy, it was so Brown. It was exactly the symbol I hungered for at the end of my longest time away from home, one that would broadcast my identity as an infinitely successful and gloriously happy first-year Brown student to others and to myself. But after the deed was done, as I looked into the dirty mirror of that Thayer Street studio, I already understood a truth: No amount of holes in my ear would reconcile the fact that my first semester at Brown was nowhere near as fantastic as I had dreamed it would be.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’m a junior now and wish I could tell you that every day spent on College Hill is a perfect one. But even as the self-proclaimed biggest fan of Brunonia, I can’t. But I will offer this to students who are now wrapping up their first semester: Hang tight. While I can’t promise you that collegiate life will improve, I can tell you that your first semester, and each semester beyond, will inform your perspective and expand the breadth of your college experiences. When you come back to school for the spring semester, campus will not be the unknown place you were thrown into this fall. Buildings will have effortless nicknames and Courses@Brown will make a lot more sense.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if it there are only a few recognizable faces — perhaps classmates, neighbors or fellow club members — they will paint your walks to class.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s this tighter reign of Brown that will grant you confidence in the decisions you will make on campus, the ones that will develop and expand your experience on College Hill. With this sense of command comes a heightened sense of conviction in the validity of your choices: what you study, where you spend your free time, who you spend it with. Don’t underestimate how empowering simply knowing more about your own college experience can be.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the same time, appreciate how there are so many activities and resources and clubs you have yet to try out or even hear about. Joining a sorority at the beginning of my second semester was a rebirth of my freshmen year, a totally new endeavor for me. It invigorated me, introducing new trajectories I hadn’t even considered. This experience occurred after my first semester, and there may similarly be undiscovered areas of your collegiate life that reveal themselves later. The knowledge you gain from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>your first semester will grant you the confidence to approach them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To the first-year who feels intimidated by the beginning of a new semester, you are not alone. Coming back from winter break is a strange moment where everyone starts over. Shopping period is a show with many, many plot twists. Whether it’s your first year or your fourth, chaos ensues as you start to doubt the perfectly constructed course cart made in November. In adding and swapping and dropping classes, there can be a sense of community amidst confusion. Moreover, we permit this momentary mayhem for the sake of allowing ourselves the chance to enrich our lives at Brown. If you felt lost this first semester, consider how temporary disorder might provide you with an enhanced perspective when approaching future college experiences. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My collegiate life has been measured by the number of Northeast Regional trains taken and the book annotations scribbled and the hours spent waiting in the lunch line at the Ratty. It’s been measured in the pounds gained and lost, the tears comforted on the Main Green, the stunning walks and late-night conversations had. Very literally, it’s been measured by the time I’ve spent on this campus, learning it, complaining about it and admiring it. Hang on if you feel lost — with every new class taken, event attended and person met, your life at Brown will expand, swelling up with every new decision made. And this could be exactly what you need.</span></p>

		<title>Richardson &#039;20: A Built space</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This September, the student organization Black Students United at Cornell submitted a list of demands to their administration in which they defined the historically underrepresented black students on campus as “Black Americans who have several generations in this country.” In response to their demands, Bami Oke ’20 wrote a recent column in The Herald, yet she uses the term “African American” to describe “black folks whose families have lived in the United States since the time of the Atlantic slave trade.” Clearly, many people use the two terms interchangeably. I have no problem with these inconsistencies because the definitions are personal, but they can also produce confusion. Quite frankly, in reading the BSU statement and Oke’s response, I have no idea which identities within blackness they are describing, because the conversations are often reduced to circular arguments steered by varying definitions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This ambiguity in referencing various black identities in the United States is one of the reasons that conversations pertaining to them cannot happen effectively. “African American” and “Black American” are the terms used most commonly, yet they are generally ineffective because they still allude to slavery. Depending on who is asked, African Americans and Black Americans are usually defined as the descendants of enslaved people in the United States. But it’s disheartening to label a group of people based on their connection to slavery; there is no life to it, no forward movement behind it. It is beyond time to build anew off the labor that was sacrificed. For this reason, we need to devote a completely different term to describe the person descended from enslaved people in the United States: “Built.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Built” is a term recently coined by a group of Brown students and is, in my opinion, the only term that adequately describes the descendants of enslaved people because it has more power than the arsenal of words currently used. Built is reflective of the knowledge that black people in the United States did in fact build this country during slavery and long thereafter. Built people exemplify excellence, strength and so much more because enslaved people<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>endured a boatload of atrocities for over 300 years. While Built still refers to slavery, it does so in a progressive manner that symbolizes both the past and future of black people. There is action behind Built. The true power in the term, however, is that it finally gives these identities a name that does not use “America” in the title. This omission is important because it highlights the fact that Built people are not products of America; America is quite literally a product of Built people. Given all that this country has done to oppress Built people, why should we have to wear a name that directly references that very history?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It’s time that Built people reclaim their identities and are represented by terms that adequately describe their histories and current situations. These conversations are perhaps most important to have on college campuses because, for the greater part of history, predominantly white institutions such as Brown didn’t accept the very people that built their campuses. Only recently has there been a valiant effort to promote diversity and inclusion on campuses, but there is so much more to be done. To catalyze these conversations and create spaces specifically dedicated to Built people, there need to be student groups solely dedicated to Built students on campuses. Right now, Built students at Brown are free to join the vaguely-defined Black Student Union, which serves as a melting pot for anyone who identifies as black. Organizations like BSU bring together the intersecting identities of blackness and form a sense of community across them. This demonstration of solidarity is valuable and breathtaking, but there should also be room for student groups specifically directed toward particular identities. For example, Harvard has a Nigerian Students Association, the University of Texas at Dallas has a Kenyan Students’ Association and Brown itself contains the African Student Association and Students of Caribbean Ancestry. The presence and continued role of these groups within their communities only underscore the fact that Built people need a group of their own. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Now is the time to establish such a student group here at Brown. As a Built woman on campus, I have found a nucleus of 20 people who want to identify similarly — more people than I had initially imagined — and this sense of community has helped us express our common, racialized experiences at Brown and across the country. Together, we are building a space on campus that caters to our varying needs. Built is currently an unofficial student group, but we will be filing for categorization by the Undergraduate Council of Students next semester. I encourage any students or potential supporters who are interested in learning more to reach out to me directly for more information.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like many other Brown students on the hunt for a summer internship, I am captivated by the tech industry. There are many obvious reasons driving students to seek jobs and internships at companies such as Google, Amazon, Uber and Tesla: These companies are innovative and seem to pamper their employees at every turn, from benefits (Google offers its employees free massages and nap pods) to creative office designs (Airbnb models its headquarters’ conference rooms after apartments rented on the site). But perhaps most importantly, tech companies are extremely powerful in the modern global economy, making the work done there all the more impactful. Google continues to map the world, Amazon has brought a significant portion of consumer retail online, Uber has introduced the age of self-driving cars to Pittsburgh and Tesla has revolutionized the electric car, to name just a few innovations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The industry, however, is still relatively young, and its companies’ actions now walk the line between growing pains and abuses of power. As Mark Liang ’19 noted in his recent column (“Too much tech,” Nov. 14), these companies are now deploying their clout in real estate markets: Amazon has cities “pimping themselves out” as potential sites for their new headquarters while Snap Inc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“single-handedly” gentrified Venice Beach, to the dismay of its lower-income residents. Though tech companies receive more attention for their roles in producing these urban problems, more insidious are the issues of gender-based pay imbalances and sexual harassment plaguing the entire industry. These two problems are inextricably linked, as gender imbalances in pay and power put men in a position to harass, while cases of sexual harassment are usually symptoms of wider gender-based issues. The tech industry has well-documented problems on both fronts, and unfortunately it seems as though the known cases are only the tip of the iceberg.</span></p>
<p class="p2">For example, Google — whose public relations history had long remained unmarred — is perhaps the most notable tech company to be called out for gender-based wage disparities. According to a New York Times report published this year, Google pays its female employees less than male employees “at most job levels.” These kinds of relatively widespread problems can be symptomatic of even deeper cultural issues. For Google, this certainly seems to be the case: This summer, the company fired a software engineer, James Damore, who sent out a company-wide memo claiming that women are paid less because they experience “higher levels of neuroticism” than men, among other reasons.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In particularly egregious cases, these kinds of sexist attitudes can balloon into pervasive cultures of sexual harassment. Within the tech industry, Uber is the poster child of this phenomenon. The company was rocked by a mass firing of twenty employees this past summer, including the company’s former CEO, Travis Kalanick, following investigations into 215 sexual harassment claims. Now Uber, in addition to facing lawsuits against taxi driver unions around the world, faces a lawsuit for racial and gender discrimination from three female plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The issue of sexual harassment is particularly relevant now in light of allegations against Harvey Weinstein, former President George H.W. Bush, Kevin Spacey and Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., among other entertainers and politicians. But the issue deserves special attention in the tech industry because of its influence over the country’s ideas and values. Tech companies control the channels of communication through which ideas are created and shared, and have an inordinate impact on the information to which people are exposed. Just look at President Trump’s prolific use of Twitter, or Facebook and Google’s role in the 2016 election. If we allow gender discrimination to go unchecked in the country’s most influential companies, the culture can spread to other industries and it will only result in the tech industry becoming more male-dominated by construction. We are already seeing some of this in action: Although there are no exact numbers, according to the New Yorker, almost half of the women who enter tech eventually leave — more than double the rate among men — and among women who do leave, 60 percent claim that harassment contributed to their decision.</p>
<p class="p2">As Brown students, it is worth our time to investigate the histories of companies where many of us aspire to work. But, given that 16 percent of the Class of 2016 went into the tech industry, I wouldn’t advise students to simply write off companies that have questionable records, since the vast majority do. Instead, the Brown student body has a tangible responsibility to engage with these companies and improve their cultures and equitability should we ever work for them. There are Brown alums in the process of doing this, such as current Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi ’91, who signed the White House’s Equal Pay Pledge in 2016 as CEO of Expedia and plans to promote a similar ethos at Uber. While gender-related problems are dissected on a daily basis at Brown, the tech industry continues to struggle to even acknowledge the existence of these concerns. Brown students can and should help to address these important issues in the professional world.</p>

		<title>Overall ’19: Embracing discomfort abroad</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/12/03/overall-19-embracing-discomfort-abroad/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In my study abroad program this semester in Amman, Jordan, each student is placed with a local host family. Both of my host parents, Issa and Mary, are Palestinian and grew up in Palestine prior to moving to Jordan. This is not uncommon, as it is estimated that at least half of Jordan’s population has Palestinian ancestry. However, five minutes into our first conversation, I realized how unprepared and uninformed I was to talk about my host parents’ background with them. I immediately felt like an outsider.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before studying abroad,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had taken one class at Brown about the Palestine and Israel conflict, but all that resurfaced when I anxiously raked my brain during our first family dinner were inapplicable generalities about the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israeli Defense Force. As I continued to converse with Mary and Issa over the next few weeks, I increasingly became aware of how little I knew about Palestinian culture, heritage and the unwavering pride among the Palestinian people — and how much knowledge they had to offer. Mary and Issa did not leave Palestine of their own volition: They left their hometown of Ramallah together in 1967 after the Six Day War as two out of the roughly 300,000 Palestinians in exodus following the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. By hearing about their experience leaving Palestine, I learned more about the issue than in any survey course I had taken. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Mary, Issa and I spent more time together, I could feel our dynamic shift; the space between the three of us now allowed for the exchange of more emotional and personal stories. Mary and Issa explained to me that neither of them can return to their homes today because neither of them were allowed a Palestinian passport. I learned about one of the greatest points of controversy within my new temporary family when Sawsan, Mary and Issa’s eldest daughter, wanted to attend a university in Israel in order to pursue her master’s degree against the wishes of her family. These real-life stories revealed aspects of the conflict that I had never been exposed to in a classroom.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But perhaps the most important takeaway from my time with Mary and Issa was my newfound understanding of my role as an outsider. Amidst every conversation about their lives, I had to actively think about how I was receiving the stories and information they told me and how I crafted my response. I embraced both the physical and emotional distance I have from the uncritical coverage in the United States surrounding the Palestine and Israel conflict. I have had to divorce myself from what I previously thought I knew, however uninformed it was, in order to fully understand what Mary and Issa have gone through to provide their family with safety and security. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Crucially, Mary and Issa’s stories have forced me to try and reconcile how to embrace my identity as a white American traveling in the Middle East for the first time and as a new member of a family whose lived experience is one I can barely wrap my mind around. It has taken me three months to come to terms with the fact that feeling like an outsider should be embraced, not rejected. But not everyone benefits from this realization. As I discussed in a previous <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/12/confronting-exclusivity-study-abroad/">op-ed</a> for The Herald (“Confronting the exclusivity of study abroad,” Nov. 12), study abroad is a largely exclusive experience that often caters to superficial engagement with host countries. Yet true and meaningful learning can only take place when we, as students from American institutions studying abroad, choose to step out of our comfort zones and acknowledge our place in the conversation as outsiders. To truly experience a foreign country and culture, embracing discomfort is the most respectful and important thing a student can do.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My friend Gwen recently told me about a moment of vulnerability that she experienced. While conducting an interview for her research project on the urbanization and collective memory within Weibdeh, a part of Amman, she asked her interviewee about Black September, an armed conflict that was fought in 1970 between the Jordanian army and the PLO. “That is a part of Jordanian history that no one wants to bring up here,” he responded, taking offense to the question. Gwen had no idea that this question and historical event would evoke such a strong reaction. But unity between and within the Palestinians in Jordan is extremely important, and openly talking about when there was disunity crosses one of those invisible boundaries. As Gwen came away from that interview, her feelings of discomfort and vulnerability were less significant than her new understanding of how imperative rhetoric was in building national unity in Jordan. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is an intense beauty in being uncomfortable. It is in this space that you can openly embrace your agency over your discomfort while simultaneously learning the most about yourself and your surroundings. Since I am a white, American woman, recognizing the difference between my lived experience and Mary and Issa’s has helped me let go of my preconceived notions and made me more open to what they have to teach me. I have come to understand that the first step to embracing all foreign environments and social boundaries is a willingness to be uncomfortable. Traveling can have an extremely profound and transformative power but, as with any relationship rooted in power, humility and respect must be put forth first.</span></p>

		<title>Liang &#039;19: Where are the Asians in Hollywood?</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/12/05/liang-19-asians-hollywood/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When it was announced last week that Chinese <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/11/30/disney-casts-chinese-actor-for-mulan-reboot/">actress</a> Liu Yifei would play the titular role in Disney’s live-action remake of “Mulan,” I almost cried with relief. “Mulan” is one of the very few American movies (and by far the only animated one) that I think represents my culture and history well. Keep in mind that the animated movie has a dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy and a matchmatcher by Harvey Feinstein — the bar is not set that high. Even with the casting of the live-action movie, I am still somewhat worried about rumors that the male love interest was going to be replaced by some generic white man, or that the Mandarin used in the film (if we were lucky enough to have any) would be clipped, accented and broken. Despite this caveat, we should take heart in the fact that Hollywood starting to care about accurate representation. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But we still have a lot to wish for in terms of Asian American representation in film. Hollywood has never screamed “cultural representation” in its movies and works, especially for Asians and Asian Americans. I can name three examples from recent years off the top of my head of Asian characters being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/31/ghost-in-the-shells-whitewashing-does-hollywood-have-an-asian-problem">whitewashed</a>: Scarlett Johansson in “Ghost in the Shell,” Tilda <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/doctor-strange-whitewashing-tilda-swinton-marvel-1201762267/">Swinton</a> in “Doctor Strange” and Nat Wolff in the Neflix <a href="http://ew.com/movies/2017/04/27/death-note-remake-whitewashing-backlash-roy-lee/">movie</a> “Death Note.” We are also a group that gets fetishized often and doesn’t really have the history of mobilization and representation within the industry to fight back. As the comedian Ali Wong <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/03/ali-wongs-radical-raunch">told</a> the New Yorker, “I think people think that Asian Americans are really good at hive-mentality stuff — you know, like, in entertainment maybe they’re good at ‘America’s Best Dance Crew’ dancing, or, like, tennis — but not at being truly innovative and having something to say that will create a cultural Zeitgeist. What hurts is when I feel like Asian people believe that about ourselves.” It’s not just creativity — I firmly believe that high-profile studios don’t find Asian men attractive enough to lead a movie or Asian women complex enough to be anything but sex objects.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And even when studios cast actual Asian actors as Asian characters, they tend to be token ethnic characters added for entertainment rather than nuance. Take Mantis <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/17/15624888/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-mantis-wrong">in</a> “Guardians of the Galaxy.” Or the Vietnamese-American girl, Kelly Marie Tran, in the new “Star Wars” <a href="http://www.scmp.com/culture/film-tv/article/2087847/forty-years-ago-star-wars-landed-trailer-last-jedi-released">movie</a>. There’s even a new token Asian woman in the “Fantastic Beasts” film in production (I think she’s an exotic werewolf or something equally objectifying). “Avengers: Age of <a href="https://qz.com/839236/dr-strange-asian-whitewashing-marvels-box-office-success-sends-the-wrong-message/">Ultron</a>,” “Sixteen <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/02/06/384307677/whats-so-cringe-worthy-about-long-duk-dong-in-sixteen-candles">Candles</a>,” “Pitch <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pitch-perfect-2-and-the-rise-of-hollywoods-casual-racism">Perfect</a>.” The list goes on and on. It’s not that I don’t think these actors deserve their breakthrough roles into Hollywood; my question is why many of these characters were given bit roles or only introduced into sequels or blockbusters after the movie series was proven successful. Why weren’t these actors members of the starting cast? Here’s a running joke I hear from family working in Hollywood: “Add enough representation so it sells in China, but make sure it doesn’t have too much representation for China.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There isn’t enough faith that Asian actors can hold their own, but at the same time, Hollywood loves to pull elements out of East Asian culture for its own purposes. Filmmakers have taken inspiration from concepts from the mecha genre (“Pacific Rim”) to martial arts (“Kill Bill”). I hear the next Wes Anderson movie is set in dystopian Japan. It’s hard as members of the public to discern between real homage to these fields and cheap knockouts designed to make money. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But authenticity does sell movies, whether you believe it or not. (Can you imagine? It’s almost like people actually want to see versions of themselves on screen that aren’t caricatures or exaggerations.) Just look at “Coco,” the new Pixar movie. Sure, it was directed by two white men, but they were smart enough to bring in a full Latinx voice cast, hire cultural consultants and fund enough research trips to Mexico to make me actually believe that they were well-intentioned. The result? The highest-grossing film in Mexico. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So how do we discern where the line is drawn? I think the first step is to think critically about casting and representation. If there is a movie that draws on cultural heritage, are many roles — acting or otherwise — filled with people who have lived through those experiences? Don’t give me that crap about a dearth of talent in certain groups. Contrary to popular belief, there are tons of talented Asian-American screenwriters, actors and entertainment workers who are capable of producing excellent work. They’ve had to rely on other options to promote their visibility, like Youtube, but they are more than capable. I just want to see more of myself on that silver screen.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Movie executives are finally (finally!) betting on movies with central casts made up of people of color. Disney is bankrolling live-action projects of “Mulan” and the “Lion King,” and thankfully realizing that white actors might not be the best idea this time around. We’ve got exciting <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/11/ava-duvernay-ryan-coogler-a-wrinkle-in-time-black-panther-diversity-representation-inclusion-hollywood-1202211899/">projects</a> like “A Wrinkle in Time” and the “Black Panther” led by talented black artists. For the first time in a long time, I am excited about the artistic direction in Hollywood — I just hope the institution has the foresight to follow through.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The recent crisis in Honduras has found its way to the public sphere in the United States, but it has not gotten nearly as much attention as a situation of this magnitude deserves. Honduras was just in the midst of a presidential election between conservative incumbent Juan Orlando Hernández and left-leaning Salvador Nasralla. Initial results showed Nasralla leading the vote by what many considered to be an irreversible margin. However, the next day it was announced that Hernández had taken the lead as the Supreme Electoral Tribunal stopped publicizing tallies, closed the electoral process to the public eye and postponed any official recounts. The people of Honduras rallied in massive protests on the streets of the country as allegations of mass fraud began to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/12/04/the-crisis-in-honduras-should-matter-to-the-u-s/?utm_term=.12cf28ae43ac">surface</a>. Hernández, who has been re-instated as president, has deployed several elite police forces that have violently confronted peaceful protesters on several occasions, prompting a humanitarian crisis on top of the political turmoil. Activists and observers alike have recently called out the United States, which has a history of involvement in Honduras, for their support of Hernández over the past several years. Additionally, they point to the United States’ role in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>training these military forces, calling into question their potential <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/12/03/the-president-of-honduras-is-deploying-u-s-trained-forces-against-election-protesters/">involvement</a> in the recent situation.</p>
<p class="p1">The current crisis in Honduras has served to highlight the devastating consequences of U.S interventionism in Latin America, which has threatened and continue to threaten the very institutions of democracy in countries that still<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>struggle for the right to self-determination in a supposedly post-colonial world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p1">There is a long history of U.S. interventionism and involvement in Honduras. Honduras was the original “banana republic” in the late 19th and early 20th century, during which time its people were placed second to American corporate interest. More recently, Honduras has become one of the United States’ strongest allies in Central America, especially in the face of left-wing successes in neighboring countries like Guatemala and El Salvador. The United States gives millions of dollars in aid each year to the Honduran government and provides training to the elite police units previously mentioned. Hernández, currently at the center of the crisis, has several times been called an important <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/us-ally-says-he-won-honduras-presidential-election-hondurans-disagree">ally</a> of the United States by various conservative leaders in the U.S. government. All of these policies are created under the umbrella of the war on drugs and crime that has been used as a justification for American interventionism for decades. However, this rationalization has, in many cases, been a pretext for more deeply entrenched motives — namely, maintaining U.S. control over Latin America.</p>
<p class="p1">The United States continues to contribute to fraudulent, anti-democratic regimes in Latin American countries where the motions of democracy take place but have no real consequence. These actions reflect a disrespect for what are supposed to be some of the core values of American society on the part of many of the most powerful and influential figures in our government. It is important to talk about the implications of this crisis for the American people and the responsibilities of the educational sphere and the media in informing the public of the consequences of this kind of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="p1">While there has been some mainstream coverage of the situation in Honduras, comprehensive accounts have been scarce, and the ones that are available tend to be muted in their depictions of violence and injustice. This, of course, reflects the reluctance of the American media in portraying what many leftist leaders in Honduras and the United States have characterized as U.S.-funded violence and injustice. These issues point to a larger problem regarding the way information about the impacts of U.S policy on the rest of the world is shared to the American people. This problem can be traced back to gaps in the education system, where American interventionism in Latin America is barely touched on. When it is discussed, it is often talked about in a positive light. Students are even more rarely exposed to the continuing prevalence of these policies by recent U.S. presidential administrations. The crisis in Honduras, along with other crises of democracy in places such as Puerto Rico and Venezuela, has served to expose the fact that American involvement in Latin American society and government is long from over.</p>
<p class="p1">The University shares in this responsibility as a top-level educational institution and a hub for progressive thinking. Brown has shown a commitment to addressing these issues. The University offers a wide variety of courses regarding Latin American cultural, social and political experiences. We have many organizations dedicated to fostering awareness. And crucially, we have a rich culture of action, teach-ins and discussion groups. However, as an elite institution in the United States, we continue to maintain a problematic, patronizing approach to confronting issues regarding people and places that are so far away from us. Even higher learning institutions need to adjust how they look at American interventionism to combat a deeply ingrained culture of support for these policies. In relation to the issues in Honduras, it is not the United States’ responsibility to step into this country to run elections, ensuring that they are safe and just for all Hondurans. Rather, it was our responsibility from the very beginning to allow for the democratic process to take place in what was supposed to be a sovereign state, untouched by the insidious arm of American interest.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After numerous flip-flops, inaccuracies and hand-written revisions at the last minute, the Republican tax bill passed the U.S. Senate by one vote in the wee hours of Saturday morning. A largely similar bill had cleared the Republican-dominated U.S. House of Representatives on Nov. 16, setting the stage for negotiations about the differences between the bills before a final version is put forth. The bill — which proposes a $1.5 trillion tax cut that would primarily benefit the wealthy and add an estimated $1 trillion to the national debt — has been widely derided as irresponsible, inequitable and, frankly, incomprehensible. But another troubling (and for us, all too pertinent) aspect of the tax bill has largely slipped under the radar: its wide-ranging implications for colleges and college students across the country.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">First of all, the bill slaps a 1.4 percent excise tax on the investment income earned by universities with endowments that amount to more than $500,000 per student. Republican lawmakers have argued that this is necessary because the wealthiest universities sit on massive endowments that they do not spend on students. But decimating university budgets won’t direct more funding toward students. And while only about 30 higher education institutions qualify for this additional tax, these universities also have some of the largest financial aid programs in the country and work on cutting-edge research.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The bill also doubles the standard deduction for charitable giving. In simpler terms, this clause reduces incentives for taxpayers to donate part of their income to charities and nonprofits — including universities. Coupled with the Trump administration’s defunding of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, these clauses will drastically shrink the research funding available to academics. American universities have long been renowned for operating on the front lines of research and development. How long will this last if their budgets are slashed?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But perhaps most concerning is the bill’s forecasted impact on graduate students. Bizarrely, the Republican plan treats graduate students’ waived tuition of $50,000 a year as income. As a result, even though most graduate students earn under $30,000 a year in the form of stipends, they will be taxed in the same bracket as those who earn $70,000 or $80,000 a year. According to a recent Herald editorial (“GOP tax plan sets up roadblocks to graduate programs,” Nov. 26), this will leave graduate students at Brown with approximately $13,000 in disposable </span><span class="s2">income. When we factor in the average price of housing on College Hill, the bill could leave them with as little as $6,000 a year for all other expenses. Not only that, but the new bill also makes the interest paid on student loans subject to taxation and repeals the Lifetime Learning Credit, a 20 percent tax credit on up to $10,000 in tuition. Both of these changes to the tax code will make higher education — and particularly graduate education — even less accessible to low- and middle-income students. In all, the tax bill will only disincentivize students from entering undergraduate and graduate programs alike.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If Republicans were serious about promoting job growth, they would be funneling money toward the institutions that are critical to the economy — not punishing them. It might be too late to stop the enactment of this tax bill, but this should not stop us from raising our voices against Republicans’ short-sighted approach to governing. After all, we still have one more major state election left in 2017, and many more to come next year. The GOP revealed how they really feel about education last Saturday, and it’s time we hold them accountable at the ballot box.</span></p>

		<title>Cardoso &#039;19: How not to protect civil rights</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/12/05/cardoso-19-not-protect-civil-rights/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just today, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. According to the petitioner, his baked goods are not only items that he sells from his shop, but also forms of expression themselves, like a sculpture or a painting. Making cakes that tacitly approve of some behavior that he opposes, then, would be a violation of his right to free expression. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As with most debates within the “culture war,” the discourse has been nothing short of acrimonious. In his Dec. 4 column for the New York Times, entitled “How Not to Advance Gay Marriage,” David Brooks went a step further, though, in his analysis. According to Brooks, the decision by the gay couple to resort to the court system was an overreaction and largely a function of our polarized politics. Yet while it is true that American political culture has been polarizing with particular intensity in recent years, Brooks’ analysis is at best poor advice and at worst a form of complicity in the denial of rights to Americans on the basis of sexual orientation. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The essence of Brooks’ argument is that there were two ways for the spurned gay couple to resolve the dispute. First, he outlined the “neighborly” approach, which involved recognizing that it was just a cake, inviting the baker over for dinner and then patronizing him for other services. This approach, according to Brooks, leaves everyone happier and helps to detoxify our political discourse. After all, if the couple weren’t so ideological or emotional, then they wouldn’t be upset by the baker’s decision in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The other approach is legal action — wielding the force of the state to achieve some desired objective. This approach is bitter and vindictive and clumsy. Brooks holds that we must resist the temptation to go down this path. We must, instead, strive to resolve our conflicts through “neighborly” behavior. In this imaginary world, we could simply resolve most conflict by ignoring the source of tension completely. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In fairness, Brooks is not wrong in recognizing that our political culture is toxic, nor in noting that we could probably resolve many interpersonal conflicts with sugar rather than salt. But his efforts to apply this approach to safeguarding fundamental civil rights is unreasonable. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For starters, the dispute is not simply “about a cake.” It is about legitimizing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. When asked by Justice Anthony Kennedy if he felt it would be constitutional for cake shops to display signs reading “we don’t bake cakes for gay weddings,” the petitioner’s lawyer responded affirmatively. This is disturbing — the logical conclusion of this argument is not that gay couples will need to find new cakes, but rather that they can be marginalized and demeaned publicly. Either out of well-intentioned misunderstanding or some contrived effort to appear moderate, Brooks’ argument reduces efforts to achieve equal treatment before the law to a dispute over cake. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> Indeed, the case is truly about protecting fundamental constitutional rights. Allowing businesses to deny service on the basis of sexual orientation (or any reductive categorization) in the name of protecting free speech is both heinous and clearly unconstitutional. LGBTQ+ people in the United States are entitled, by the constitution, to equal protection before the law and, by their status as human beings, to dignity. Forcing gay couples to turn the other cheek on one issue because it seems trivial is profoundly misguided. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My intention, though, is not to get too deep into the legal weeds. Rather, it is to demonstrate that Brooks’ recommendation of “neighborliness” is misguided and reflects the long and storied tradition of powerful groups resisting social change in the name of moderation. Rather than squabbling over neighborliness, we should realize that it is never acceptable to expect that those denied constitutional rights should appease those denying those rights in the first place. Brooks’ approach may seem to be a “reasonable” middle road (he notes his “fervent” support for same-sex marriage). But his approach is simply the same, tired story of the “moderate” who, as Martin Luther King, Jr. once noted, “is more devoted to order than to justice.” Turns out, when it comes to “neighborliness” and justice, you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last month, I was lucky enough to attend the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, commonly known as COP23, in Bonn, Germany. While there, I saw world leaders, environmental activists and even a delegation from Brown (which included Professor of Environmental Studies and Sociology J. Timmons Roberts’ Climate and Development Lab) participate in meaningful work advancing solutions to the most pressing problems of climate change. Unfortunately, I also saw firsthand a trend that I fear is becoming all too common: the tendency among American liberals to define all of their actions in relation to President Trump, even at the expense of real progress.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, Trump’s presence was always going to be felt at COP23. This June, Trump announced that the United States would exit the Paris Agreement, to the dismay of all level-headed people, including a majority of people in all 50 states. But, since the withdrawal process will take up the remainder of Trump’s term in office, a delegation was shipped out to Bonn last month to, in the words of a State Department press release, “ensure a level playing field that benefits and protects U.S. interests.” In line with this “America First” rhetoric, the delegation hosted just one public side event at the conference. Its title? “The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation.”</p>
<p class="p2">Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg aptly likened this event to “promoting tobacco at a cancer summit.” About two-thirds of the event’s attendees, including myself and students from the Climate and Development Lab, interrupted the panel discussion with a song set to the tune of “God Bless the U.S.A.” and then staged a demonstration outside with many climate justice and indigenous groups. The Trump administration’s foray into the climate world seemed designed expressly to provoke (and even troll), and it was met with a resounding chorus of rejection that significantly increased media coverage of the event. The success of this direct action underscores the importance of activism that is inclusive, urgent and impossible to ignore.</p>
<p class="p2">Across town, housed in a temporary tent structure that most resembled a tennis court bubble, the U.S. Climate Action Center was staging its own form of rejection — but their effort fell flat. The center was there to represent not the official U.S. delegation, but the “over 2,500 cities, states and tribes, businesses, academic institutions and faith groups” that have joined a nationwide network called “We Are Still In” — that is, still in the Paris Agreement. Across seven days of programming, the U.S. Climate Action Center was determined to drive home one message in addition to their “We Are Still In” motto: “We Are Not Trump.” In other words, its climate policy for “The Resistance,” headlined by political heavyweights like Bloomberg, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown.</p>
<p class="p2">Not being Trump is certainly a good start, but inside the literal bubble of the U.S. Climate Action Center, climate change felt less like an existential threat than a playing field on which elites could score political points. Those on the front lines of climate change — for example, indigenous peoples, subsistence farmers and citizens of small island nations — were lost on a stage of senators and governors jostling to make the best crack at Trump. The irony was brought into sharp focus when Gov. Brown, interrupted mid-speech by a group of indigenous activists protesting his affinity for fracking, proceeded to make a Trump-style threat to “put (them) in the ground” while still trying to flash his climate credentials. Putting the moral repugnancy of his remark aside, Brown’s defense of California fracking is fundamentally at odds with the Paris Agreement; the oil and gas fields we have already developed are more than enough to push us past the 1.5 degree threshold, even if we never build a new one. The entire incident was reflective of the self-congratulatory, myopic nature of that contradictory political strategy.</p>
<p class="p2">On climate, as with so many other things, Trump has lowered standards so spectacularly that politicians can become heroes by putting in little more than greenwashing. We need to remember that supporting Paris is a low bar. Former ExxonMobil CEO and current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson does. Literally every other nation in the world does. Moreover, when Trump is framed as the sole villain, it’s all too easy to ignore our own culpability: We are the world’s second-largest emitter and largest historical emitter (by a long shot) for reasons that have nothing to do with him. If we’re going to do anything about them, we need to look beyond solutions that sink to Trump’s level.</p>
<p class="p2">These are trying times for American democracy, but they are endlessly more trying for those already bearing the brunt of the effects of climate change that the Browns and Bloombergs of the world will never have to face. We need to expect more from our Resistance. One day, (I pray) Trump will be gone, but climate change will still be here, and it still won’t be politically expedient to make the kind of changes we’ll need. The politicization of climate change in American politics may well devastate entire societies and nations — if it hasn’t already — not just because of Republican denialism and obstructionism, but also because it has become another way for Democrats to score political points. If I learned one thing at Bonn, it is that real climate action rests on a foundation made up of people, not politics.</p>

		<title>Savello &#039;18: Toward a broader job search</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/24/draft-savello-column/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the spring semester begins, students are scrambling to secure summer internships and post-graduation positions. The pressure is especially high for seniors, who will soon be completing their final semester and walking through the Van Wickle gates into the dreaded “real world”. For those of us seniors who still don’t have a job lined up after fall recruitment, it can be a stressful or even anxiety-inducing experience. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Financial uncertainty is perhaps the most stressful element of the job search. Most graduating students need to find an immediate way to support themselves economically or pay off student loans, and the lingering uncertainty surrounding job prospects and potential salaries can be unsettling. Not only do these students need to figure out where they are going to live, they also need to consider their budget and living expenses. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet financial anxiety is not the only motivating factor for graduating students. There is also a pressure, particularly for Brown and other Ivy League students, to go on and do something extraordinary after college. Every day, we are bombarded with news of students going on to attend top-tier graduate schools, receive Fulbright grants and take prestigious jobs at multi-million dollar companies. While Brown has a reputation for being one of the least competitive Ivies, post-graduation plans can create competition between students and, in turn, affect students’ levels of self-confidence and self-worth. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To seek validation, some students mass apply on job boards, seeking opportunities solely based on the organization’s prestige. But this is a problematic mindset to have. If you ask<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>people who have graduated in recent years, most admit that their first job was not their favorite or most glamorous job; it was mostly a learning experience or a way to break into an industry. Thus, while taking on the challenge of finding a first job, students shouldn’t be basing their decisions off of the “prestige” or “reputation” of the organization. They should be looking for opportunities that offer room to learn and grow and that foster a positive work environment. Oftentimes, this environment can be found not in a big-name industry hub, but in a smaller organization where young employees may play a larger role.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another issue that can limit students in their job search is a tendency to turn down post graduation internship opportunities because they don’t pay well or lack a professional title. After all, why settle for being an intern when you can hold a full-time position? But what few people realize is that these internships often open doors to entry-level positions at the end of the summer and can lead to new connections within the field. In addition, if you ultimately don’t like it, you only need to commit to three months there, compared with a year or two for many full-time positions. Unfortunately, too many internship programs are low-paying or only offer stipends, but the networking and opportunities they offer can result in more rapid advancement in the field, allowing them to pay off in the long term. Other career paths may only be accessible through internships. For example, many ad agencies, magazines and digital media companies hire recent grads for internship roles with the intention of training for them for a full-time position at the company, rather than using a more traditional entry-level recruiting process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, CareerLAB and other on-campus resources do not effectively expose students to the variety of career paths open to them, which only makes the job search process more stressful. Instead, CareerLAB takes a narrower approach to the job hunt. They bombard students with messages about career fairs, the Handshake recruiting tool and constant reminders about consulting, finance and technology opportunities, only heightening the pressure to land a traditional, high-stress position. Not only can this tactic discourage students from looking outside of the most popular companies, but it can also deter them from considering internships post graduation. CareerLAB distinctly separates the job and internship searches, targeting their internship resources and events at underclassmen, while only marketing full-time jobs to seniors. This is a troubling binary to follow, as it’s not inclusive of alternative career paths and reinforces the unrealistically high standards set for Brown students. CareerLAB also fails to offer adequate student support in calculating their financial needs after college. Cover letters and resumes aren’t the only things students need help with; figuring out the appropriate salary to cover living costs is just as important, if not more, to students’ job searches, and this should be given more attention during career counseling sessions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moving forward, the University should work towards broadening conversations about the job search. Perhaps instead of having seasoned alumni with top roles and degrees come speak at campus events, they can invite younger alumni who can speak about navigating their first job or two in fields outside of consulting, finance and technology. CareerLAB can also make more of an effort to diversify the job fields and companies they promote to students and help demystify stereotypes about pursuing a post-graduation internship. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By showing students that they are not alone and making the job search a more manageable task, the University can help make senior year less stressful and more enjoyable — as it should be.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><em><span class="s1">Samantha Savello ’18 can be found applying to jobs (and internships!). She is a former employee of CareerLAB. She can be reached at samantha_savello@brown.edu.

		<title>Cardoso ’19: Brazil’s democracy woes</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/24/cardoso-19-brazils-democracy-woes/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just yesterday, a Brazilian appeals court ruled to uphold the bribery conviction of former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. With this ruling, the court has placed significant obstacles before da Silva, who is planning to run once more for president in this year’s election. However, what may ostensibly appear as a triumph for Brazilian democracy — the conviction of a popular former president seems to suggest a strong, independent judiciary — is in fact the opposite. Yesterday’s spectacle evinces a fiercely partisan court system that, rather than rendering a judicious verdict, has internalized the same antipathy toward the country’s traditional political class that is shared by most of the population. While Lula is himself still a member of that political class, many Brazilians fondly recall the prosperity of his years in office despite this widespread anti-elitism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The issue with the proceedings against da Silva began from the get-go. His trial judge, Sérgio Moro, has achieved superstar status in Brazil for his work leading the investigation into Brazil’s all-consuming corruption scandal, “Operation Car Wash.” Indeed, his status is largely built on his reputation as the brave judge that would “clean up” Brazil’s corrupt political class. Convicting da Silva, then, would appear to be a crowning achievement in his effort to root out corruption in Brazilian politics. While fighting corruption is a laudable effort, Moro’s tactics seem to demonstrate that he had already adopted a grim view of those he was investigating before he tried them in court. He created a media frenzy when he had police surprise da Silva in his home and then drag him out for questioning. This was after da Silva had already publicly agreed to be questioned. Moro was also chastised by the Supreme Court when he released wiretapped conversations between da Silva and his successor, Dilma Rousseff.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Any hope of receiving a fair appeal would also have been sanguine. Before the ruling, the chief judge of the panel overseeing da Silva’s appeal <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/triplex-sentenca-de-moro-tecnicamente-irrepreensivel-diz-presidente-do-trf-4-21675452">called</a> Moro’s decision “technically flawless.” The judge’s chief of staff posted publicly on social media that she supported da Silva’s conviction. It is not surprising, then, that the panel not only unanimously ruled to uphold Moro’s decision but also increased the severity of the penalty to twelve years and one month in prison. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast to the chief judge’s praise for Moro’s ruling, the actual conviction was based on very poor and limited evidence. The prosecution’s sole piece of evidence is the testimony of one former construction company executive who had his sentence reduced in exchange for his cooperation. According to several analysts, no European or American court would have ruled to convict based on the evidence presented.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That a court would so readily convict someone based on personal biases and with little substantial evidence is worrying in itself. What is truly disturbing, though, is the ruling’s implications for Brazil’s democracy. Last year<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/cardoso-19-precarious-state-brazilian-democracy/"> I wrote</a> that Brazil’s democracy was in recess after the country’s then president, Dilma Rousseff, was, according to almost all objective observers, impeached for political reasons. Even though Rousseff won the popular vote, her opponents in the National Congress ousted her based on a common violation of a budgetary law. She was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer, who began to implement harsh austerity policies — exactly the opposite of what Rousseff vowed to do. Fast forward to today, and the courts have blocked da Silva, who is the favorite to replace Temer in this year’s presidential election by a very large <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-poll/brazils-lula-bolsonaro-well-positioned-for-2018-elections-poll-idUSKBN1CY0TF">margin</a>, from even competing. In doing so, the courts are placing their distrust of Brazil’s political elite before the will of the country’s people. Despite its good intentions, this type of judicial parochialism will only continue to harm Brazil’s nascent democracy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By inserting itself into partisan politics, Brazil’s court system has chipped away at another pillar of Brazil’s quickly crumbling democratic institutions. Without reliable institutions to regulate political disputes fairly and peacefully, Brazil will continue its descent into vicious political tribalism. The response by da Silva’s Workers’ Party evinces the urgency of the situation. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42776058">According</a> to one Workers’ Party leader, “Lula will not be arrested, for Lula to be arrested, people will have to be killed. … They’re going to have to kill us, and kill Lula. It will not be peaceful.”</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Milo Yiannopoulos, the notorious political celebrity and former Breitbart editor, may think that his brand is “dangerous” — the title of his personal website and most recent book. But he is, in fact, entirely predictable. Like every other provocateur before him with no real talent or skill to showcase, he resorts to controversial statements and outright insults to garner attention. And this strategy has worked for Yiannopoulos. His rhetoric is obviously incoherent and hateful — but that didn’t stop him from becoming the ninth most Googled personality in 2017. Yet, as student bodies across the country protest to keep him from speaking (for good reason), his support base becomes increasingly convinced that Yiannopolous’ voice is being silenced because liberals cannot handle being exposed to a conflicting viewpoint. Or worse: because liberals are afraid of losing to him.</p>
<p class="p2">If we truly wish to push Milo into the irrelevancy that he deserves, progressives must stop giving him exactly what he craves to maintain his popularity: the satisfaction of watching us be offended. It would serve us much better if students allowed Milo to perform his foreseeable tricks on stage. Deny him — and his supporters — the satisfaction of trolling young liberals, and instead engage with him calmly, though that requires courage. It’s no secret that Yiannopoulos delights in targeting marginalized populations.</p>
<p class="p2">From his Breitbart articles to his Instagram posts to his talk show, Yiannopoulos basks in the blowback to his outrageous, deliberately provocative behavior. In 2017, he wished everyone but single mothers a Merry Christmas on Instagram — because, he insinuated, single mothers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/14/single-mothers-hot-messes-smilf-frankie-shaw">should be blamed</a> for allowing their families to fall apart. Needless to say, his statement sparked outrage, and women spoke up against the misogynistic claim that single mothers do not have their children’s best interests at heart. Countless women commented that they had been victims of domestic violence, or had been widowed, or had simply been unhappy in their previous marriages. But Yiannopoulos didn’t care about any of the messages left on his inflammatory post, and he probably didn’t have a real stance against single mothers. He was, however, enjoying watching his Instagram engagement climb. It’s the oldest trick in the book. When you have nothing of substance to offer, create scandals.</p>
<p class="p2">But the best way to counter Yiannopoulos’ manufactured scandals is not to shut him down, as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/us/milo-yiannopoulos-berkeley/index.html">protestors at the University of California at Berkeley</a> did last year. Such responses only empower him and energize his sympathizers. Yiannopoulos used the ensuing media storm to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2017/02/03/milo-yiannopoulos-dangerous-book-breitbart/97449536/">sign a book deal</a> and secure several appearances on television, during which he claimed that liberals were denying him his constitutional right to freedom of expression because they were scared of his ideas.</p>
<p class="p2">Don’t get me wrong — I believe students are right to oppose his disturbing rhetoric. But it’s about time we stop letting ourselves become a vehicle for Yiannopoulos’ pathetic ticket to fame and fortune. After all, his book, “Dangerous,” was a bestseller because there’s something attractive about the story of a man hated, banned and feared by young liberals. But if Yiannopoulos’ story weren’t so exciting — if he encountered engagement with his ideas, instead of violent protests or even calls for his removal from campus — I doubt he’d sell as many books, gain as much conservative sympathy or make as many headlines.</p>
<p class="p2">Critics have alleged that giving Milo a platform at a major university — even if he’s been invited by student groups, not the university itself — normalizes his message. But stopping Yiannopoulos from speaking to students strengthens his popularity and persuade his supporters that he was right in branding the left “intolerant.” Letting Milo speak is not the same as surrendering to his ideas; it’s the exact opposite. It’s a sign that young, liberal students are firm in their own convictions and can counter poisonous rhetoric, no matter how inflammatory, wherever they see it.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So instead of shutting Yiannopoulos up, young, liberal students on college campuses should give him a chance to speak and challenge him on his deeply flawed beliefs — even though this is a larger burden for the groups he has targeted. Young liberals should ask him how he is comfortable living with so many contradictions. He married a black Muslim man and yet is <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/05/07/kids-need-a-mum-and-a-dad/">against gay marriage</a>, Muslim immigration and Black Lives Matter. Instead of booing him off the stage (as Yiannopoulos expects and, likely wants, them to do), young progressives should show him that they are ready to offer an intellectually sound rejection of his prejudice. As Bryce Campanelli ’18 wrote in a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/12/campanelli-18-change-campus-needs/">column</a> last year, this sort of engagement may actually prove constructive, teaching students how to refute unfamiliar or extreme ideas. Of course, healthy debate probably won’t change Yiannopoulos’ views. But it will likely undermine his provocative agenda — since scandals generally don’t start at respectful academic forums. Young people must remember that Yiannopoulos is dangerous not because his message is meaningful or worth hearing, but because it is amplified by controversy.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Every new year I make myself a grandiose list of resolutions to follow and every year I forget about them by the end of January. Like most other resolution-ers, I tell myself that I’m going to eat healthier, get back into the gym, smile more, etc. But then all of a sudden life gets in the way and, as Busta Rhymes would say, I’m back on my BS. This year was different though. This year, I didn’t bother setting goals for myself that I knew I couldn’t achieve. Instead, I thought about things in my life that were so easy to fix that I hadn’t even realized that they were problems. Next time you decide it’s time for a big change, remember that it really is just the little things that count.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stretching, for instance, may seem pointless if you don’t play a sport or work out often, but it is actually one of the most beneficial things you can do for your body. In 2015, a Harvard Medical School article stated that the older you get, the less flexible your joints become over time. This in turn can make everyday activities like walking up the stairs or picking something up off the ground significantly harder, and can sometimes even lead to injury.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When I was in high school, I </span><span class="s2">played sports all year round and so stretching was a vital part of my everyday routine. But transitioning from a tri-varsity athlete to a regular college student meant that I no longer had any coaches or gym teachers monitoring my physical fitness. It wasn’t until I took a trip to Health Services for help with migraines that I realized how grave my problem was. Because I had gotten so used to not stretching, my neck muscles tightened and my shoulders began to slouch. My neck was then forced to carry the entire weight of my head and, as a result, I suffered from tension headaches almost every day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> My doctor was kind enough to show me some simple stretches, and two days after I started doing them, the headaches stopped. It just goes to show that your basic 20-second static stretches can make a world of a difference.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Another promise I made to my</span><span class="s2">self is to avoid eating late-night dinners. I’m going to say this only once: midnight Spicy Withs are NOT your friend! I can’t even count the amount of times I’ve trekked to Jo’s after a long day of classes and work, ordered a whole bunch of greasy food and gone straight to bed, only to wake up with a throbbing stomach and intense regret. Believe me, I get it. We’re in college, and some of us already have so many obligations that we can’t help but procrastinate on eating too. But it shouldn’t be that way.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Poor eating habits in your late teens and early twenties can often lead to heart disease and other health complications later on in life, which could all be avoided by small changes in your diet. I’m not going to tell you what or when you should eat, but as a general rule of thumb, try to leave at least three hours between your last meal and the time you go to bed. That way, you won’t wake up feeling like you’re pregnant with Renesmee from Twilight, but instead you’ll have an appetite for breakfast which puts you right on track to eat three meals a day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">All of my new year’s resolutions may seem minor at first, but behind each of them, there’s a bigger picture. Instead of trying to figure out my whole life and change the world at the start of each year, I’ve learned that gradual adjustments can pay off in the long term. Resolutions don’t have to be immediate — Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither were you. </span></p>

		<title>Thomas &#039;21: The second semester slump</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of the “sophomore slump” has significance outside of the college context: An artist’s second album might not be as good as their first, star rookies lose their luster and sequels are often worse than originals. So, it only makes sense that the second semester of the first year in college may be more challenging than the first. But we don’t acknowledge this particular slump, instead implicitly deeming sophomore year the only acceptable time to experience a decline in enthusiasm. This oversight can make the experiences of some freshmen almost invisible, with serious consequences for students’ well-being, graduation rates and higher education at large. A reckoning with this question is long overdue: What happens when the “sophomore slump” actually comes during your second semester?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are many reasons why the second semester might produce a lull. For starters, a month-long winter break can be jarring for some freshmen still working to find their groove on campus. Most high school winter breaks are two weeks long, which is short enough that most students find it easy to get back in the rhythm of classes. In college, though, the break is much longer. Brown’s winter break is double the time, and rightfully so — the work that goes into a semester warrants more time off. The issue arises when students must return to campus after such a long layoff. While students should enjoy the well-deserved break afforded to us, our semester-long adjustment to life at Brown resets. Right before heading home, we’re operating at full speed and as soon as we get back, we’re thrown right back into the thick of things, expected to pick up where we left off. It’s kind of like when you first arrive to college, minus all of the orientation stuff. </span></p>
<p class="p2">A new semester also means new opportunities — and new challenges to students’ well-being. Using their first semester as a benchmark, second-semester freshmen might push themselves to do more and do better — both in classes and in extracurriculars, social engagements and other activities — than they did their last semester. But, in the race to make the most out of the college experience, other important priorities can fall by the wayside. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201801/is-the-perfectionism-plague-taking-psychological-toll">A recent study</a> in the Psychological Bulletin found, between 1989 and 2016, a 10 percent uptick in self-oriented perfectionism — the need for perfection — and a 33 percent increase in socially prescribed perfectionism — thinking others expect a lot from you — among American, Canadian and British college students. Andrew Hill, a co-author of the study, believes that this pursuit of perfection can potentially harm students’ mental health, noting increases in student depression, anxiety and suicidal thought levels. So, while the goal of making the most of a new semester might initially seem positive, some freshmen might succumb to the pressures of perfectionism and inadvertently develop a fear of imperfection or failure. And, in its worst forms, this fear can drive some freshmen to lose confidence and even drop out of school altogether — after all, only 58 percent of American freshmen return to the school at which they started for a second year. In a convoluted way, attempts to excel in the second semester may have the potential to produce a slump before students even get to sophomore year.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perhaps the biggest difference between the first and second semesters of college is the latter’s focus on the future. Where last semester it may have been possible to stay in the moment and focus on the present, it’s now impossible to escape talk of the summer and next year. It can feel like the ability to explore and play in the sand has been rolled back a bit — and it has. Conversations with your Meiklejohn shift from, “What classes should I take this semester?” to “How do I become a Meiklejohn?” In addition to the books and papers assigned in classes, you also have to read up on companies and organizations to start crafting cover letters. To be clear, becoming a Meiklejohn and applying for summer opportunities are not the immediate causes of a slump. Rather, it’s the way in which they reorient the typical workload from one centered around classes to one that is concerned with classes, resume-building and career development that can cause a slump. Of course, it’s reasonable to expect changes in workload and focus as you progress through college. But this change occurs sooner than we might think, and not everybody is ready to handle it the first time around, in their second semester.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">`Because the “sophomore slump” is the dominant narrative, those who find the second semester to be much more of a challenge than the first might feel isolated in their experiences and think less of themselves for feeling the true weight of college earlier than they’re “allowed” to feel it. But freshman year is a pivotal, make-or-break time for college students. Ignoring their experiences will only make it harder to improve graduation rates, improve higher education and make sure students leave college with a strong sense of purpose. So, what can be done to remedy the “second semester slump?” Brown might consider developing programming for the second semester, similar to orientation. Unit-wide presentations that highlight resources on campus, managing the internship search and planning for sophomore year would not only provide students with useful information entering their second semester, but would also allow them to reorient themselves to Brown before being thrown right back into the mix. The second semester of college is different from the first, but there are ways it can be enjoyable, too.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">What do Donald Trump, Chuck Schumer and Paul Ryan all have in common? It sounds like I’m about to write a joke about the lack of diversity among federal politicians. That’s certainly tempting, but as I’m bombarded with emails about career fairs and resume-writing workshops, there’s another, not entirely unrelated, issue at the front of my mind: None of them pay their interns.</p>
<p class="p2">Trump boasts about how the economy and the job market have improved under his presidency. But while 21 departments in the White House offer internships, all are <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/get-involved/internships/apply/">unpaid</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Schumer was involved with <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Charles_Schumer_Jobs.htm">co-sponsoring</a> the Minimum Wage Fairness Act, which would have eventually raised the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, but Schumer’s interns currently work for <a href="https://www.schumer.senate.gov/students/internships">free</a>. Paul Ryan has, so far, raised over <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00004357">$10 million</a> for his 2018 campaign, yet has the gall to say that he is <a href="https://paulryan.house.gov/constituentservices/internships.html">“unable to offer paid internships.”</a></p>
<p class="p2">If politicians want to make a statement about economic equality, if they want to drain the swamp of the Washington elite and open up opportunities for economically disenfranchised Americans, then they should start with their own hiring policies, and compensate their interns for the work they do. In addition, because race and wealth are inextricably tied, unpaid work poses an additional barrier for students from underrepresented minorities seeking government work. Though there is an awareness in Washington among senators like Schumer that the lack of diversity in the Senate is a huge problem, there has not been enough attention devoted to making access to government jobs more equitable.</p>
<p class="p2">Penn <a href="https://piw.sas.upenn.edu/resources/living-dc/cost-estimate-eight-weeks-dc">estimates</a> that it would cost students a minimum of $4,500 to work an eight-week internship in Washington, D.C. Time had a higher <a href="http://time.com/money/collection-post/4269235/summer-internship-real-costs/">estimate</a> in 2016, calculating that it would cost around $6,200 to spend 10 weeks at an internship in one of the five cities that students most wanted to intern in, D.C. included. Whatever the exact number, the point remains that it’s expensive: According to the Council for Community and Economics Research’s <a href="http://coli.org/quarter-2-2017-cost-of-living-index-release/">report</a> from the second quarter of 2017, D.C. had the fifth highest cost of living in the United States.</p>
<p class="p2">The only students who can afford to take unpaid internships with the government, then, are the ones who have several thousand dollars saved. They’re the ones who don’t have to worry about earning money to pay for the following semester. The government officials who refuse to pay their interns ensure that the connections, recommendations and experience gained from a summer on Capitol Hill are reserved only for the financially secure.</p>
<p class="p2">This issue crosses party lines. One wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that Democrats would pay at a higher rate than Republicans; after all, it’s typically the left that campaigns for minimum wage increases. But White House interns were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/president-obama-its-time-to-pay-your-interns/2016/07/14/db8d6520-43ae-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html?utm_term=.cfa35c54948c">unpaid</a> under Obama, just as they are now under Trump.</p>
<p class="p2">This bipartisan reliance on unpaid interns is further highlighted by a 2017 report from Pay Our Interns, an organization which “advocates for an increase in the amount of paid internships <span class="s1">within our government, for-profit, and nonprofit </span>sector(s),” which showed that while 8 percent of Republicans in the House paid their interns, only 3.6 percent of Democrats did as well. Apparently it’s easy to support pay increases in theory, but when it comes to putting your money where your mouth is — well, that’s a little harder.</p>
<p class="p2">It’s not impossible, certainly; Bernie Sanders does, in fact, <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/services/internships">pay</a> his interns $15 per hour, the minimum wage that he has repeatedly endorsed. But Elizabeth Warren, another well-recognized progressive on Capitol Hill, only offers the vague <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=internships">statement</a> that a stipend might be available to students who aren’t getting academic credit or receiving funding from other sources. Political leaning doesn’t mean much when it comes to paying your workers.</p>
<p class="p2">Students without the means to easily fund their own unpaid internships are left with an uncomfortable choice. They can stretch their finances to the breaking point, maybe taking out more loans to pay for the next semester. On the other hand, they can eschew whatever free time they would have had to explore D.C. and take on a second, paying job.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, they could just not aim for an internship with Congress or the White House. They could spend the summer working for a local politician, saving money while living at home. Or they could find a different, paying job or internship altogether.</p>
<p class="p2">But the fact that students have other options makes the existence of unpaid internships no less disturbing. What does it mean when our public servants expect us to pay for the privilege of interning for them? When the officials who are supposed to represent us, who are supposed to be pushing for our best interests, are only willing to offer positions to people who can either afford it or who are willing to make significant financial sacrifices?</p>
<p class="p2">If politicians won’t begin paying interns on their own, then it falls to their constituents to pressure them until they do. It’s time to stop normalizing unpaid labor. The only way to have a government for the people is to have a government made of the people, and that won’t be possible until everyone has an equal chance to make their way into the political arena.</p>

		<title>Steinman &#039;19: When #MeToo is split in two</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It began with solidarity, with the tragic understanding that if the testimony of one woman is a fabrication and the testimony of two is a conspiracy, perhaps that of a few hundred or million could become a movement. With each woman who took to Twitter or the New York Times or the family dinner table to say “Me, too,” a system that has accommodated sexual assault and harassment became ever more difficult to ignore. And the #MeToo movement, true to the hashtag that precedes its name, could probably only ever have flourished in a time like this, when almost every woman in this country has access to a platform that can carry her protestations across the world. Thanks to social media and the internet, these stories are much harder to sequester or silence. But in its inclusion of the breadth of experiences that constitute sexual assault, #MeToo has begun to dangerously conflate sexual discrimination in the professional and in the interpersonal spheres — two problems which require different approaches and solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Initially, #MeToo — at its most successful — showed us that the same culture of sexual harassment and assault that pervades Hollywood exists in workplaces everywhere. The pattern of behavior that Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K. and Kevin Spacey engaged in to keep their victims silent — drawing on the power to destroy their victims’ careers — is typical of this culture. #MeToo’s true strength lies in its ability to disrupt that power to silence by opening up a floodgate of accusations that can never be closed again.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And then came Aziz Ansari. Suddenly, a movement that had been defined by abuses of power, and the efforts that had been made to hide them, was dealt a much more ambiguous hand — not a criminal night, just a bad one. For those who haven’t followed the <a href="https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz-ansari-28355">story</a>, a woman using the name “Grace” gave an account of her date with actor and comedian Ansari, where she claimed that he took her back to his apartment and repeatedly attempted to pressure her into sexual acts, ignoring her obvious discomfort and nonverbal cues. When she eventually voiced her objections, he called her an Uber home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What Ansari did that night was wrong, but it stands apart from the other high-profile #MeToo stories in obvious ways. It was not a pattern of abuse of professional power, not a rape. Rather, it was the last in a series of failures that begins with our culture’s belief that men must persuade women to enter into sexual relationships and ends with a blatant violation of respect and trust. Certainly, a power imbalance and a large dose of male entitlement still exist in the Ansari case, but it would be misleading to equate them with the more sinister power dynamic intentionally exploited by Weinstein, C.K. and Spacey. While it can be argued that Ansari poses a threat to Grace by virtue of being a male celebrity, Weinstein, Spacey and C.K. actively capitalized on their positions of power to threaten their respective victims. On the other hand, Ansari’s behavior has gripped the public imagination not because he is a celebrity engaging in loathsome behavior permitted solely by virtue of his position of power, but because many men — well-meaning and otherwise — can, and do, identify with him.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ansari’s case shows us that there are two #MeToo movements: one dedicated to ending the culture of silence that protects powerful serial rapists and abusers, and another dedicated to shifting the norms for consent in all sexual interactions. The former requires an emphatic and, crucially, public callout to ensure that the perpetrators can no longer hide behind power structures. The latter should take a different approach — outright vilification on social media is a less useful tool when Ansari’s behavior occupies a space that is obviously abhorrent to some but less clearly violative to others. To be sure, Ansari’s behavior ought to be understood as unacceptable — but as our definition of consent is being constantly refined and improved, I am not convinced that online public shaming is an effective method of communication and education. A better, more refined and more lasting definition of positive, enthusiastic consent cannot be brought about through shaming, but requires dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="p2">In addition, while abuse in the professional space can be remedied through termination, the only way to resolve a case like Ansari’s is through a change in male behavior, which requires that Ansari understand his wrongdoing. This was certainly Grace’s intent in texting him; I do not believe that talking to babe.net advances this goal. While the onus of consent education should not be placed entirely on Grace — Ansari certainly should have known better, as a self-styled feminist, and must commit himself seriously to understanding Grace’s perspective, as should men everywhere — the process of redefining and refining consent is necessarily a collaborative one. Shutting down discussion through online public shaming, though it can be empowering in the moment, is necessarily self-defeating for women everywhere as it fails to produce a culture of consensus, only one of fear.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The nuanced work of redefining consent should not be accompanied by flashy headlines and viral hashtags, but that is no reason to neglect it. It takes a different approach — overhauls of sex education and the way relationships are depicted in the media, but also conversations between longtime couples and people who are meeting for the very first time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To foster a safer environment and eliminate the scourge of sexual assault from our interpersonal relationships, it is time to think seriously about the tools that are needed to reach a common understanding of consent grounded in equity, respect and empathy.</span></p>

		<title>Miller ’19: Gerrymandering - a political scapegoat</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/31/miller-19-gerrymandering-political-scapegoat/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">According to an old saw, gerrymandering is the “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gerrymandering-is-the-root-of-all-political-evil-or-is-it/2018/01/27/c12af98a-02e9-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html">root of all political evil</a>” in the United States. Certainly, it has been a facet of majority rule since the Union was formed. But is it the fundamental corruption of an otherwise flawless system or a scapegoat for many other political ailments?</p>
<p class="p2">Gerrymandering is the intentional manipulation of suffrage by corralling voters with known political leanings into voting districts where their ballots will cause partisan advantage or disadvantage to one party, race, class or point of view. The act of gerrymandering is usually accomplished via the drawing of voting districts to favor or accentuate a point of view or party affiliation over its competitors.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Today, regardless of which political party is currently in power, gerrymandering is still a tool used nationwide to solidify and thereafter preserve the influence of the party in question. In some instances, district lines have been drawn so finely as to encompass single houses or create districts whose maps are so convoluted as to have been nicknamed “Goofy Kicking Donald Duck” or “The Upside-Down Elephant” based on their physical resemblance to those scenarios. Many argue that this practice reduces competition, ferments extremism and improperly dilutes voices in a political system where everyone is entitled to an equal and unweighted vote in the election of their government representatives.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Yes, gerrymandering creates small, misshapen districts — concentrating like-minded individuals, diminishing or increasing their voting power, drowning out many voices and breeding a platform for extremism. However, it is naive to think that gerrymandering is the sole root of our political problems and that “fairly” redrawing the lines would act as a national panacea.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhode Island is an example of a state where gerrymandering has had discernible results. According to a legal brief quoted in the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170907/gerrymandering-case-reopens-old-wounds-for-ri-lawmakers">Providence Journal</a>, “as of 2017, Democrats hold 86 percent of the state Senate seats and 84 percent of the seats in the General Assembly.” The Journal continues: “For context: The 307,600 registered Democrats make up 39.9 percent of R.I.’s 770,589 voters.” This state of affairs has policy implications; in 2016, the Democratic-held legislature passed a law that increased tolls on trucks though the majority of voters polled preferred an alternative Republican <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release/2017/10/02/440114/release-rhode-island-partisan-gerrymandering-negatively-affects-legislative-accountability-fair-representation/">proposal</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2">In response to 2011 redistricting, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/02/08/editorial-in-rhode-island-we-trust/">editorialized</a>: “We cannot support a redistricting bill that was conceived without the best interests of Rhode Island at heart.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The argument is clear that gerrymandering has imbalanced the Rhode Island political system to favor Democrats, and in so doing has drowned out the voices of many constituents.</p>
<p class="p2">However, according to FiveThirtyEight’s recent “<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/rhode-island/">Gerrymandering Project</a>,” regardless of how you redraw the map and redistrict the state, Democrats are still most likely to win both Congressional seats on the national level. According to their model, when redrawing lines to maximize Republican advantage or create the most competitive election, the odds of a Democratic victory in the second district, which encompasses southern and western Rhode Island, fall from over 85 percent to 65 percent, and the number of expected Republican seats out of the current two rises from 0.2 to 0.3. While not insignificant, these small increases alone do not reflect a large enough impact to claim that gerrymandering has been the sole impediment to fairness in the democratic process in Rhode Island. And, according to the same research, Rhode Island’s second congressional district is one of only 30 districts of the 435 in the United States that would be considered competitive — where a party would win by a margin of less than 20 percent — once redistricted to favor either Republicans or Democrats. An argument can be made that Rhode Island is so small that it is not representative of the national landscape, but non-competitive elections are clearly a nationwide problem that the reversal of gerrymandering alone will not solve.</p>
<p class="p2">These numbers show that gerrymandering to maximize partisan advantage does not fully explain the symptoms frequently associated with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A more relevant culprit can be identified in the “<a href="http://www.thebigsort.com/home.php">Big Sort</a>,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the idea that like-minded individuals are clustering in certain districts, leading to a further polarization of the democratic system. Following the 2016 election, an <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/09/don_t_move_to_canada_liberals_move_to_a_swing_state.html">article</a> titled “Don’t Move to Canada, Liberals. Move to a Swing State” implored liberals looking to flee President Trump’s America to instead move to competitive electoral states and balance the increasingly polarized electoral college. In other words, the article argues that individuals should fight fire with fire:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>settle away from like-minded individuals to make more districts competitive and increase individual voting power. Certainly, if we continue to view gerrymandering as an evil, we cannot use it as a solution to the very problem of which we complain. At the very least, while we should not lay idle and allow the worst excesses of gerrymandering to persist, we cannot continue to label it as the root of every flaw in our political system.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just over two weeks ago, Amazon announced the names of 20 cities that had advanced to the final round of selection for its second headquarters (HQ2) location. As these finalist municipalities were selected from a pool of 238 proposals, an acceptance rate of 8.4 percent, Brown students can rest easy knowing that their accomplishments are still more impressive than those of America’s twenty most promising cities, given that Brown’s acceptance rate last year was 8.3 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/30/u-admits-record-low-8-3-percent-applicants-class-2021/">percent</a>. As for the remaining 218 cities, Amazon rejected them much in the same way many internships and colleges probably rejected you recently: with a tone of artificial sympathy and a hollow compliment to boot. “Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough — all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,” said Holly Sullivan, an executive at Amazon Public Policy in a company statement quoted by <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/18/technology/amazon-hq2-short-list/index.html">CNN</a>. This atmosphere may be indicative of the kind of poisonous mindset the HQ2 bid, which sets the precedent for future tech mega-deals, is creating: one that conjures up the worst elements of the college or internship application process — self-destructive gamesmanship, debilitating competition and zero-sum mentalities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Amazon was not kidding when it stated that “incentives offered by the local communities … (would) be significant factors in the decision-making <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Anything/test/images/usa/RFP_3._V516043504_.pdf">process</a>.” It seems that among the twenty finalists — whose qualities of life, academic resources and population sizes are similar — incentives are the only consideration separating one city from another. This, combined with every city’s desire to win the competition at any cost, is generating nonsensical subsidies and tax plans designed for Amazon from the cities still under consideration. Stonecrest, Georgia, famously offered to rename the city ‘Amazon’ in the event of a relocation there; thankfully, it is no longer in the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/city-amazon-proposed-attract-company-hq2-georgia/WVuopYRd6WFQE3w7JjcdnO/">running</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But in economic terms, the deals offered by the cities still in the running are just as illogical. Chicago, for example, offered to let Amazon keep $1.32 billion in tax revenue collected from HQ2’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/amazon-hq2-20-cities/550790/">employees</a>, while the governor of Maryland is offering Amazon a $5 billion package ($2 billion in Amazon-centered road and infrastructure projects and $3 billion in tax breaks) that would represent the largest economic development package in state history in order to lure the company to <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-amazon-package-details-20180122-story.html">Montgomery County</a>. Columbus, Ohio, is even offering to waive 100 percent of Amazon’s property taxes for 15 years — equivalent to $456,750 for every $1 million of investment in <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/news/20171019/documents-detail-columbus-bid-to-lure-amazons-2nd-hq">property</a>. Since the incentives offered specify no requirements for growth on Amazon’s end, the cities bidding to host HQ2 are in a race to the bottom of their budgets in order to win over a company that may (or may not) generate enough economic activity to justify the ridiculous tax breaks proposed. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The unprecedented level of gamesmanship involved in the hunt for an Amazon deal is undoubtedly rooted in each city’s ego — the mayor of Dallas, Mike Rawlings, even stated, “We dream no small dreams here. We want to be the biggest and the best” — and none of the cities entertained the idea of signing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/business/economy/amazon-finalists-incentives.html">cooperative pact</a> not to offer Amazon any <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/20/opinions/amazon-headquarters-competition-disturbing-richard-florida-opinion/index.html">subsidies</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But it may also be rooted in speculation about the future of the tech industry in general. As the economy becomes increasingly dependent on an industry whose economically viable innovations are often unprecedented and unpredictable, American cities likely see Amazon’s HQ2, with its track record of growth and its stable hold on the tech and logistics industries, as a panacea.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But cities are not considering the ways in which landing the Amazon deal may be worse than losing it. Amazon promises to bring at least 50,000 new workers with large salaries to its HQ2 site. That means that housing costs will most likely skyrocket, raising prices even in the suburbs, straining the highway and public transportation network and widening the chasm between affluent and <a href="https://www.citylab.com/solutions/2018/01/how-cities-can-strike-a-win-win-deal-with-amazon-hq2/551348/">poor residents</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The labor market in the selected city will become significantly more competitive as the city draws more applicants on a national scale. And cities that inherit these problems will most likely have gambled their tax revenue away to the company that precipitated these issues in the first place. While in the long run, Amazon may have a stabilizing effect on the local economy, in the short term, its presence will definitely destabilize the area.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though it would have been nice to have Amazon internships in our backyard, perhaps the city of Providence dodged a bullet when Amazon passed on its “Providence Station” <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171108/envisioning-amazon-hq2-in-heart-of-capital-center">campus</a>. All we can do now is wait and see how HQ2 ultimately impacts the chosen city. The whole world will be watching.</span></p>

		<title>Savello ’18: Writing courses for all</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/04/savallo-18-writing-courses/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine walking into a classroom full of 50 people vying for a spot in a 17-person class. Students are sitting on the floor, propped up on windowsills and even standing. The professor eventually comes in and tries to make their way through the crowd, calling the names of students who are registered. You know, those who clicked the fastest during registration. The professor then informs the rest of the students that they can submit a writing sample to get on the waitlist, which has one available spot, maybe two. At this point, the process of getting into the class has quickly become one of cutthroat competition, full of anxiety, self-consciousness and, for the vast majority, disappointment. In one section of ENGL 0930: “Introduction to Creative Nonfiction” this semester, 70 people showed up for the first day of a class capped at 17, according to attendance statistics pulled together by the department to track this very problem. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Does all of this sound daunting and stressful? Of course it does. Unfortunately, this is the harsh reality for many students trying to get into capped writing courses, especially those in the English Nonfiction Writing Program or Literary Arts Department, among others in the humanities. But why does getting into a writing course have to feel like the academic equivalent of the Hunger Games?</p>
<p class="p2">Brown’s inability to meet student demand in the Nonfiction Writing Program and Lit Arts Department, particularly for introductory courses, has been an issue for years, and it’s one that comes with extreme consequences. First and foremost, it prevents students from trying their hand at introductory writing courses like LITR 0110A: “Fiction I” or ENGL 0930: “Introduction to Creative Nonfiction,” undermining the very essence of the “open curriculum.” In turn, this inability to get into the introductory classes then creates a snowball effect by further barring students from taking upper-level classes in these departments. And for interested concentrators, this lack of access can be enough to deter them from these concentrations completely.</p>
<p class="p2">As a result of this, I know of students who have switched out of the Literary Arts concentration because of the scarcity of available classes, and of students who gave up on nonfiction writing because of the daunting waitlists. I personally had to wait three semesters to get into Introduction to Creative Nonfiction, which, given the academic demands we all face, is an unrealistic expectation.</p>
<p class="p2">Another issue is the competitive process of getting into the class. When students are judged based on writing samples to get into courses — especially introductory ones — it can create feelings of personal failure or cause them to doubt their abilities if they end up low on the list, discouraging them from future writing courses. Even when professors use a lottery-based system instead, the image of the overfilled classroom can be enough to turn all but the most committed students away — the opposite of the inclusive atmosphere that introductory classes should be fostering. The restrictiveness of the introductory courses makes it difficult for non-concentrators to explore new ways to improve their writing in a collaborative environment — skills that will transfer into other aspects of their education.</p>
<p class="p2">For a school that prides itself on its diverse liberal arts education, Brown certainly is not improving the situation to give its students better access to Nonfiction Writing and Lit Arts courses. Its inability to respond is just as hypocritical as it is concerning. After all, the writing requirement is literally the only academic requirement Brown has, and they consistently claim that they want students to leave Brown having improved their writing skills. While there are WRIT courses across many departments, the unique workshop style offered by these departments creates an exchange of feedback that makes students better and more critical writers and readers, accomplishing one of the goals laid out in “Liberal Learning at Brown.”</p>
<p class="p2">If it wants to stay true to its mission statement, the University should take action and give more attention to these departments, which are inadequately funded with respect to demand. The first step should be to create more sections of the courses, which would likely require hiring more professors. Obviously, this is an expensive endeavor, but the benefits largely outweigh the costs. More sections would mean that more of these interested students would be able to enroll instead of being discouraged from courses and departments. Increased availability would also help to boost the number of students concentrating in these departments, which have decreased (English) and remained relatively stagnant (Lit Arts) over the past decade.</p>
<p class="p2">Another possible solution, perhaps more cost-effective, would be to make better use of graduate students, some of whom are authorized to teach writing courses. And if expanding the faculty is absolutely financially impossible, the University should at least consider ironing out its waitlist process. Instead of letting students in based on who clicked first, Brown should create a lottery system for these high-demand introductory classes and clarify the writing sample evaluation process so that it is not quite as ambiguous or subjective by laying out more specific guidelines. Those on the waitlist who did not get in should also be given priority during the following semester, which will help reward students for their interest and persistence.</p>
<p class="p2">At the end of the day, Brown needs to think about the consequences of disregarding the supply-and-demand issue that the Lit Arts Department and Nonfiction Writing Program face. While students veer away from the humanities on a national level, those who choose to pursue an education in these fields or try out the courses should be met with open arms, not turned away or stuck on a 30-person waitlist.</p>

		<title>Fernandez ’21: Rhetoric of sovereignty masks American abuse of power</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sovereignty is defined by the Encyclopedia Britannica as “the ultimate overseer, or authority, in the decision-making process of the state and in the maintenance of order.” In the most conventional sense, sovereignty applies to the structure that holds the highest authority over the individuals and the workings of a given nation. The term and its importance become much more complicated when applied to the international arena. We live in a supposedly post-colonial world where the individual’s right to self-determination is viewed as inherent to the way humanity organizes itself. Yet, all too often, the limitations and ambiguities of “sovereignty” have allowed certain actors to continue to exert domination over the rest of the world through long-standing and outdated power structures. The rhetoric of American sovereignty, which often implies that some powerful states have a right to determine global standards, categorizes different human interests within a hierarchy that favors some cultures and leads to the subordination of others. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">President Donald Trump employed much of this same rhetoric in his State of the Union Address, delivered Jan. 30. Yet one section of his address in particular very clearly underscores the precarious mentality held by U.S. leaders and citizens alike in regard to the United States’ role in world affairs. When referring to the decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision plagued by international controversy, President Trump spoke of “America’s sovereign right to make this <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/30/politics/2018-state-of-the-union-transcript/index.html">recognition</a>.” This statement was followed by assurances that Congress was working toward legislation that would prioritize American interests abroad. This section of the address is easily glossed over, as it was relatively short and mentioned only in passing, overshadowed by many of the special interest stories that became the highlight of the president’s speech. However, I believe these specific words are worth pulling out and contextualizing within the larger history of U.S. interventionism, justified and rationalized as serving these ambiguous “American interests.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The long-standing issue regarding the recognition of the capital of Israel has been greatly discussed on the international stage. Several leaders in the United Nations have expressed clear opposition to President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem, shaking the fragile consensus that had been reached. The narrative of the opposition has been expressed by Venezuela’s United Nations new Permanent Representative Samuel Moncada Acosta: “The world is not for sale, and your threats imperil global peace.” The American Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, on the other hand, celebrated those who chose not to confront the decision of the United States when she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/21/politics/haley-un-jerusalem/index.html">argued</a> that “it’s clear that many countries prioritized their relationship with the United States over an unproductive attempt to isolate us for a decision that was our sovereign right to make.” Here, yet another world leader employs the very same phrase “sovereign right” to convey a sense of authority over world issues that goes well beyond a country’s legitimate claim to sovereignty, which exists only within the confines of the American state. A serious issue that surrounds the debate is the opposition’s inability to articulate their issues with these faulty claims to sovereignty. In this way, it misses the primary point that transcends this one mere instance of U.S. arrogance in its foreign affairs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is not a Trump phenomenon that we just need to bear for the next three years. This issue is about a long history of imperialist rationalization that has its roots in rhetoric such as that of “the white man’s burden” and policies of intimidation employed by many previous administrations. This is a tradition that time and time again has resulted in atrocious actions against human dignity, particularly, but not exclusively, across Latin America and the Middle East. It is an issue that will require extensive discussion and redefinition, as these discourses have historically been approached in problematic ways, even in the most progressive and academic arenas. This is particularly true as U.S. foreign policy is often viewed by the American people as a narrative of good intentions. Rhetoric dominated by phrases such as the “protection of human rights” or the “serving of American interests” has monopolized the critical discussion. And yet very few have ventured to ask: What are these human rights if not the right to self-determination? Are these really the interests of the American people, or those of the elite few that we are serving? These questions become even more important within the context of a community such as Brown’s, in which so many of us are looking to participate in the development of solutions to U.S. as well as world problems. There needs to be a conversation about what our responsibility is to the rest of the world, coming from this position of power. A conversation in which we can draw the line between aiding in collective efforts toward progress across the world, and exerting an illegitimate “sovereignty” over all of those who have traditionally been denied that right. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I like to occasionally browse the Instagram accounts of conservative activists. It’s a guilty pleasure of mine to get a peak into the mentality of the other side of the aisle, especially when it comes to politically-active individuals in my age group. And you know what I’ve learned from this Instagram education? Conservatives don’t care about Trump’s latest outrageous tweet or the Stormy Daniels affair. But there are a lot of posts about the booming economy, low unemployment rates and impressive gains against the Islamic State. And I have to say — I don’t read a lot about these achievements in the mainstream media. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Don’t get me wrong, I think President Trump’s attacks on the press are despicable, and I believe journalists have an important role to play in holding elected officials accountable and informing the public. I also think that stories regarding Trump’s ridiculous use of Twitter are important to fully understand the man that the American public has elected president. Yet, I have to admit, conservatives have a point when they complain that the mainstream media refuses to give credit where it’s due.</p>
<p class="p2">In particular, the media isn’t working to discriminate between the kinds of stories it runs about Trump. Instead, we have a hailstorm of coverage that is often critical of Trump, but not in a constructive, coherent way. That is to say, the White House, its attendant scandals and Trump’s personal improprieties receive the bulk of media coverage, as opposed to the workings of federal agencies, domestic issues and the economy. The average consumer of American news is left drowning in politics, without an informed grasp of policy. The result is an ever-growing dichotomy between conservative media outlets, who praise Trump religiously, and mainstream outlets, whose critiques of Trump focus too much on his personality — a dichotomy that leaves no room for fact-based debate or centrist, moderate politics.</p>
<p class="p2">According to a Pew Research Center report, five topics — immigration, health care, Trump’s political skills, U.S.-Russia relations and appointments — accounted for two thirds of the media’s coverage of the Trump administration. On the subject of the latter three topics, the media almost exclusively assessed Trump’s leadership and character, totally ignoring the ideological and policy foundations of his positions. Further, the media has concentrated more on Trump’s leadership and character — and judged him more harshly on those fronts — than it judged former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. In the meantime, news about the economy and Trump’s aggressive posture toward the Islamic State have been lumped into the one-third of “other” stories covered.</p>
<p class="p2">What we’re witnessing is a fundamental change in how the media covers the president and the White House. Of course, Trump is a different kind of president, but members of his base aren’t necessarily wrong when they accuse the media of unfair or biased reporting. According to many Trump voters, their candidate delivered on many of his promises, in spite of grave predictions to the contrary, and these achievements aren’t being forthrightly acknowledged by the mainstream press.</p>
<p class="p2">For example, although Trump’s actual role in the economy is contested, I think he can legitimately take credit for the downward trajectory of the Islamic State. The terrorist group was in control of 23,300 square miles of Iraq and Syria at the time that Trump took office, and the territory under their control has since shrunk to only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/politics/trump-islamic-state-raqqa-fact-check.html">9,300 square miles</a>. Coalition forces conducted 5,000 airstrikes against Islamic State targets in August 2017, the highest monthly figure in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/09/29/553735509/the-u-s-is-beating-back-isis-so-what-comes-next">three years</a>. In sum, the president delivered on his promise to give his generals more control over the fight against the Islamic State, and this strategy has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/opinion/sunday/war-trump-islamic-state.html">paid off</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">But the media has devoted a tiny percentage of their coverage to this development — even though they were quick to praise Obama for his military victories. Consider the assassination of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. In the following two days, the raid that killed him, ordered by Obama, constituted 89 percent of <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2011/05/05/how-media-have-covered-bin-ladens-death/">media coverage</a>. And the media focused mostly on the logistics and execution of the raid, not its policy implications. Obama immediately claimed credit for the assassination, even though the raid could not have taken place without the diligent work of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-path-to-osama-bin-ladens-death-didnt-start-with-obama/2012/04/30/gIQAfFmdsT_story.html?utm_term=.a3427544d14d">Bush administration</a>. Few media outlets challenged this premise. Today, though, the media has reacted to Trump’s celebration of the Islamic State’s routing with <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/356226-we-are-finally-beating-isis-but-media-wont-give-trump-credit">skepticism</a>, eagerly pointing out that Trump inherited his counterterror strategy <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/12/07/trump-takes-credit-isis-defeats-does-he-deserve/931657001/)">from Obama</a>. This double standard has — rightfully — annoyed Trump’s supporters.</p>
<p class="p2">It is a well-known fact that people on both sides of the aisle often use the media as an echo chamber for their own beliefs. And it is true that Trump is an unusual president, whose scandals and statements have no precedent. Still, it’s clear that the mainstream media has formulated and applied a different of set of expectations to Trump — a set of expectations it has held for no other president in the past three decades. By focusing on Trump’s personality, and not his policy, the mainstream media has not provided a meaningfully holistic view of his presidency. And the mainstream media’s skewed coverage hurts the progressive cause, too, by arming the Resistance with juicy personal details instead of the policy prescriptions or information they need to undo Trump’s legacy.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Over winter break, a fight — as fights often do — broke out on the internet.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown Bears Admirers, a Facebook group where Brown students submit anonymous posts, published a submission in which a user jokingly outlined their plan to destroy all Canada Goose coats on campus. In a responding post, another user fired back, “I know this post will be controversial, but I don’t care because I am hurting and need to speak out. I love my Canada Goose and shaming people for wearing canada goose is bullying.” It’s unclear whether the post — which continued to detail how the author hated being condemned for owning expensive outerwear that they didn’t even ask their parents to buy for them — was a genuine response or an artful piece of satire.</p>
<p class="p2">At any rate, these posts spawned discussion on other anonymous pages. Users continued to argue back and forth, with some commenters suggesting that their peers were jealous, bitter or discriminatory because of the jokes they cracked at the expense of Canada Goose coat wearers. Others argued that Canada Goose coats were actually a very practical investment because of their ability to last for many years. These posts, taken together, show how Brown’s largely wealthy student body struggles to constructively engage with class disparities on our campus and in our country.</p>
<p class="p2">For the most part, the Canada Goose mockery on Brown’s campus is tongue-in-cheek, but there’s a current of frustration that runs beneath the jokes students crack. Seeing gaggles of students clad in coats whose cost hovers around a thousand dollars apiece is a reminder that Brown is richly populated with the children of America’s wealthiest. In 2017, the New York Times reported on a study that used tax data to gain insight into college attendance and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html">economic mobility</a>. Study results revealed that approximately a fifth of Brown’s student body comes from families in the top one percent of income earners. Between 1999 and 2013, 70 percent of Brown students came from families in the top 20 percent of earners. The study also showed that the median income of Brown students’ families was $204,200 per year. To put this number in perspective, the median income for a family in the United States was $57,617 in 2016. These data showed us something we already knew — elite institutions, despite their recent turn toward increasing socioeconomic diversity in their student bodies, are still primarily comprised of very wealthy students.</p>
<p class="p2">Several commenters called on their peers to stop complaining and go earn themselves a Canada Goose coat. This is certainly possible — data show that 53 percent of poor students at Brown ended up in the top 20 percent of income earners as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/brown-university">adults</a>. Certainly, this would give them the disposable income to buy their own status-symbol coat, but it misses the point.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The collective groan over Canada Goose coats isn’t actually about outerwear. The parade of luxury coats that emerges on Brown’s campus in full force each winter is a reminder that we are living in a deeply divided society that clusters wealth and access to opportunity (read: attending an elite university) in the hands of the few. In 2002, Brown became the last member of the Ivy League to introduce <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/us/brown-adopts-need-blind-admissions-rule.html">need-blind admission</a>. Fifteen years later, some progress has been made. The percentage of Brown undergraduates with no expected parental contribution to their tuition is <a href="https://www.brown.edu/content/facts-about-financial-aid">35 percent</a>. But still, 58 percent of Brown students in the class of 2019 receive <a href="https://www.brown.edu/content/facts-about-financial-aid?">no need-based financial aid at all</a>. That is, their families are on the hook for the approximately $70,000 a year it costs to send a child to Brown. Our institution is still disproportionately full of the children of the ultra-wealthy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The most bizarre thing about watching the Canada Goose debacle unfold online was how few students seemed to grasp how absurd the entire thing was. There seemed to be little recognition of the fact that a $900 status-symbol coat is not a practical middle-class purchase. But our society isn’t just intensely class stratified — it is also class segregated. Wealthy families live and work around other wealthy families, which largely insulates them from any meaningful interaction with those who don’t share their income bracket. Surrounded by others of the same ilk, many rich people have no idea just how rich they are. It comes as no surprise, then, that a student body like Brown’s has no clue why others might roll their eyes as flocks of Goose-clad students stroll around campus. Unless Brown students develop a more robust awareness of the realities of income disparity in America, campus dialogue about class will remain stunted ­­­­— or worse, largely nonexistent. Hopefully, the anonymous internet infighting we witnessed this winter will help spark the conversation about class Brown so desperately needs.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Vergangenheitsbewaeltigung (German, n.): the process of coming to terms with the past.

I started this article at a loss for words. It’s ironic because I’m supposed to be a writer, but there are some instances in life that garner such great emotion, there’s little room left for anything at all to say. Such was the case the first time I saw the “Negro Crime” pamphlets that were recently plastered at the corner of Brook and George Streets and elsewhere on<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/06/naacp-community-unite-response-racist-flyers/"> College Hill.</a> As I skimmed through them, I didn’t yell. I didn’t post a rant on Facebook. But for the rest of that day, I couldn’t get the images of those hate-filled pages out of my head. “How did this happen?” I thought to myself. No doubt racism in this country is alive and well. But even here at Brown, the so-called liberal champion of the Ivy League, it’s important for us not to become complacent in our struggle for equality. That’s exactly how issues surrounding race get swept under the colorblind rug.  At the time, I figured the booklets would be justified as some white supremacist’s “freedom of speech,” and then it dawned on me: The Constitution grants us that very same right. Why not use it to continue the conversation about racism on this campus?

Last Saturday, several booklets were found around the East Side alleging “Negro Crime in Mayor Jorge O. Elorza’s Sanctuary City of Providence, RI.” Inside, the pages were littered with pictures of mostly black Providence locals, along with details of their supposed crimes. These ranged from assault and gun violence to things like “extorting money from white people” and “committing food stamp fraud.” Whether or not the content was accurate — there were no sources listed — is beside the point. The authors of this pamphlet intentionally used harmful and divisive language to get their bigoted message across.

I can’t say that I was surprised to see this kind of document in President Donald Trump’s America. What shocked me, though, was how close the flyers were to the place I’ve come to call my home. Until now, I’ve always secretly believed that all Brown students share the same basic moral values. Sure, some opinions may be problematic or ignorant, but everyone means well, I told myself. You can’t go to Brown and really be a racist, right?

In conversation on Saturday with some of my black peers, I expressed my disbelief and questioned again, is it even possible that anyone here would endorse these vile posters, even if they didn’t print them themselves?

As our discussion went on, I soon realized that the people we tend to exclude from the conversation, whether it’s because of their identity or their opinions, aren’t always going to just sit and keep their thoughts to themselves. Much like we saw in the wake of the 2016 election and in Charlottesville, many white supremacists are silent — until they turn violent. In fact, several hate groups now spread their message and gather support by sitting at their computers and posting satirical, anti-PC commentary and <a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/qvzn8p/vice-news-tonight-full-episode-charlottesville-race-and-terror">internet memes</a>. This method appeals to them because, if met with criticism, these individuals can defend themselves by claiming it was all just a joke. It may not seem too concerning on the surface, but take that harmless joke and trace it back to its origin; you could find a judge, police officer or maybe even a privileged Ivy League student who will go on to assume a position of power.

So the question is no longer who or why, but where do we go from here? How do we heal today and grow toward a happier, more equal tomorrow?

It’s often said that there is a German word for every emotion you can’t describe in English. I don’t know to what extent that rings true, but when I found the meaning of ‘vergangenheitsbewaeltigung,’ it seemed perfect. Here is a term that evolved out of Germany’s conscious effort to educate its citizens about the Holocaust and to ensure that nothing like it would ever happen there again. The Germans reflected on the atrocities carried out against millions of innocent people, accepted that their nation was to blame and then worked to atone for their wrongs. Most German people I’ve met don’t shy away from the subject of the Holocaust, but rather acknowledge their country’s past and denounce it fervently, which makes me wonder why America hasn’t done the same.

Until the time comes when we can create a language to address our own past, we as American citizens cannot afford to avoid these difficult conversations about race. As uncomfortable and angry as I was when I saw those pamphlets, there was nothing I could physically do about them. Perhaps I and a couple friends could have organized a demonstration, but what were we going to protest, freedom of speech? Alternatively, we could have gone to the authorities and demanded that they find the culprit, but I didn’t necessarily want to see someone punished either. I knew that wouldn’t do much to change any silent biases on campus, so I took all the emotion I felt from seeing those pamphlets and decided to write about it. I had to remind myself, and anyone who reads this, not to abandon words as the first line of defense — they are the strongest suit of armor we have.

		<title>Overall &#039;19: Wanting more than bad sex</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past couple of months, a radical shift in American culture has unfolded. Women have been able to publicly identify and censor men who commit assault — and for the first time in American history, society seems to be listening. Yet, while the broader culture’s condemnations of serial abusers marks a new era in which men are held accountable for their behavior, this shift has simultaneously furthered the widely-held assumption that sex is either consensual or assault. But this dichotomy is deeply flawed, for it ignores the other ways in which gender dynamics and social norms manifest themselves in sexual interactions. As author Rebecca Traister presciently wrote in her 2015 article “<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2015/10/why-consensual-sex-can-still-be-bad.html">The Game Is Rigged</a>,” “a vast expanse of bad sex — joyless, exploitative encounters that reflect a persistently sexist culture and can be hard to acknowledge without sounding prudish — (goes) largely uninterrogated, leaving some young women wondering why they feel so fucked by fucking.” Beyond the welcome progress of the #MeToo movement, there remains the eerie reality of a vast gray area of “bad sex” — <a href="https://elladawson.com/2017/12/09/bad-sex-or-the-sex-we-dont-want-but-have-anyway/">defined</a> by writer Ella Dawson as the “the sex we have that we don’t want to have but consent to anyway.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Without a doubt, sex doesn’t have to be assault to constitute a violation. Confronting the hidden scourge of “bad sex” — which, though not assault, perpetuates gendered power dynamics, normalizes antiquated social norms and results from miscommunication — is the next step in redefining our expectations of sex. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kristen Roupenian in her New Yorker fiction piece, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/11/cat-person">Cat Person</a>,” provides a stirring depiction of the lead up to bad sex and what it feels like through the perspective of a young woman. In her story, a 20-year-old college student, Margot, has sex with Robert, a much older man who she does not find particularly attractive. After a date one night, she chooses to go home with him. In the middle of their hookup, she feels a deep sense of disgust and wants to leave. But she doesn’t — she doesn’t want to come off as selfish or difficult. Afterwards, she tries to ignore Robert. Over text, he insults her character and slut-shames her. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What Roupenian describes is neither rape nor assault, but bad sex resulting from the intersection of gender and power — the product of many mens’ entitled approach to sex, and of womens’ efforts to manage men’s feelings. Roupenian’s “Cat Person” is a parable about how men and women are taught to negotiate sexual encounters differently. Men have been socialized to see the pursuit and completion of sex like the pursuit of money: the more sex is had, the more of a man they are. In contrast, women have been conditioned to minimize ourselves; take up as little space as possible, both physically and emotionally; and believe that self-assertion and objections to widely accepted masculine norms are turn-offs. In short, women are taught to expect and accept bad sex — to be malleable and non-combative at the hands of men.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In light of Roupenian’s short story, it is necessary to devote more attention to the kinds of sexual encounters — like presumptuous, uncommunicative and “bad” sex — that still hurt men and women, even though they too often escape our attention. It is true that separating sexual assault and the decidedly bad sex that Margot and Robert experience is extremely difficult. Still, as we combat assault, we must also work to address the cases that lie in the gray area. This argument does not seek to reduce the pain of emotionally violative and uncomfortable sexual experiences by not labeling these encounters as “assault.” But it is critical to acknowledge how uncomfortable sexual experiences and assault diverge and how gendered power dynamics can still govern hookups, hurt people and, as Traister notes, leave women feeling “fucked by fucking.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bad sex keeps happening, in part, because we don’t talk openly about what we want or what we’re comfortable with and instead defer to entrenched social norms. The absence of communication carries more weight and dictates the afterlife of a sexual encounter more than what is actually said. Young men and women alike are socialized to think that bad sex is normal and that going home with a stranger, waking up the next morning hungover and disillusioned and exchanging horror stories with friends at breakfast are all inevitable parts of the romantic experience. But this pervasive belief is wrong, and all genders have a role to play in resolving this dangerous dynamic. The power dynamics of gender must be confronted in the moments right before bad sex. Men must acknowledge, publicly and privately, the importance of unspoken cues during a sexual encounter and understand that consent is continual. And we, as women, can reject social norms that compel us to be passive in the face of uncomfortable situations and to brush aside of bad hookups as “something that just happened.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In order to begin to resolve the “vast expanse” of bad sex that both Traister and Roupenian discuss, I believe we need to do a better job of teaching sexual partners to communicate — face-to-face, in the moment, no matter how awkward it may be — their boundaries and their expectations. It is easy to assert that the everyday conditioning and sex education of men and women need to be re-examined, and that sex needs to be placed within a new, female-driven framework centered on consent. But putting these solutions into practice is difficult, and at this moment, confronting “bad sex” through honest communication is the best way to stop it. </span></p>

		<title>Steinman &#039;19: Time for some cautious optimism</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/13/steinman-19-time-cautious-optimism/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Over the year that I’ve edited this section, I’ve come across a number of columns that include a variation on the phrase “now more than ever,” including plenty of my own. A dysfunctional administration coupled with far more concerning long-term trends like climate change, an uptick in racism and xenophobia and attacks on the very concept of truth have extended past the political and cultural spheres to give a sense that every moment is weighed down by the impending apocalypse.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The 2018 Winter Olympics, which began in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Friday, don’t fit this narrative. How can the world be mired in division and destruction when 92 governments are willing to send 2,900 of their most talented citizens, not to mention key political leaders, to an arena just 50 miles from the nation supposedly poised to destroy us all? The very existence of this paragon of cooperation, of this celebration of common human achievement, is hard to reconcile with the gravity of “what’s going on in the world.” Attempting to do so highlights the problem with our “now more than ever” mentality: It leaves little room for genuine celebration and accomplishment and makes progress feel disingenuous, creating a culture of cynicism that could take decades to undo. </span></p>
<p class="p3">During the opening ceremony, when athletes from South and North Korea prepared to enter the arena under a common flag depicting a united Korean peninsula, an NBC commentator wondered aloud if this was a genuine step toward reconciliation or the last show of friendship before tragedy strikes. True, it’s easy enough to imagine images of that unified parade accompanying every news story in the world if the unthinkable did happen in Korea. It’s also a more comfortable concept to speculate about if you live thousands of miles away, as the commentator, an American, presumably does. But hearing that doomsday prognosis over the emotional, overjoyed faces of the united Korean team fostered a sense of imminent failure where there should have been cautious optimism. While this moment and the united Korean women’s hockey team’s game the following day were highly choreographed and symbolic, they still represent a meaningful diplomatic accomplishment, not the end of an unsteady peace.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The growing acceptance of collapsing institutions and inevitable conflict will only hasten that collapse and conflict. Though mindful of the persistent inequities and tragedies we still face, we should also take the time to celebrate the strength of the ties that bind us together without speculating on when they might sever. We should recognize triumphs — like the brief moment of Korean unity, and, more broadly, the coming together of nearly 100 nations in the name of friendly competition and glory — for what they are. This doesn’t mean turning a blind eye to conflict or injustice or shifting focus away from immediate problems. But every once in a while, it’s important to break out of the cloud of fear that hangs over nearly every story covered in the media. The Olympics offer us this opportunity once every two years, and we shouldn’t squander it.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Of course, the Olympics have never been isolated from their political contexts, and this has manifested itself in ways both powerful — Jesse Owens in 1936 and Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising the “human rights salute” in 1968 — and horrific — the murder of 11 Israeli Olympians by terrorists from a faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1972. More recently, the revelation of the decades of abuse carried out by Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor, demonstrated that the Olympics themselves need to undergo as much soul-searching as our other formidable institutions to rid themselves of a culture that permits and hides sexual assault. But ultimately, the Olympics represent the best of our liberal democratic order: a diverse community united around seeking some higher triumph and understanding across nations.</p>
<p class="p3">I hope that, rather than further complacency about the state of our world, the Olympics can remind us why we must stand up in defense of international cooperation. The Olympic vision — thousands of people of all backgrounds and nationalities standing side by side, advantaged only by their stunning talent and unwavering perseverance — bears little resemblance to the world we live in. But just as the athletes themselves provide a standard of achievement to which us regular people can aspire, we should view these two weeks not as a fleeting diversion from a world gone to pieces, but as a model of greatness that we can surely reach, with luck and years of practice.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As any driver in Rhode Island can tell you, infrastructure in our country has certainly seen better days. And while the potholes around Providence are a hassle, they don’t begin to capture the full scope of the United States’ infrastructure problem. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers — which evaluates American infrastructure annually across 16 categories, including the quality of bridges, dams, hazardous waste disposal and inland waterway transport — American infrastructure overall has a <a href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/">composite score of D+. </a> To those of us who drive, take public transport, use electricity or drink water, this should be profoundly disturbing. And while policy experts and engineers have been ringing the alarm bells for years, our federal political institutions have done little to translate these recommendations into policy. Previous efforts by the Obama administration, for example, were blocked by congressional Republicans, who at that time were still willing to sacrifice crucial public goods on the altar of <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/25/478B-Infrastructure-Bill-Blocked-Senate-GOP">“fiscal conservatism.”</a>

Yet there has been renewed interest in addressing the infrastructure crisis these past few months. President Trump has informally proposed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure project and many congressional Republicans seem on board. “Finally, serious government action!” says the armchair infrastructure enthusiast. Alas, it isn’t so. Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the president’s proposed plan would not effectively solve our most pressing infrastructure issues. Rather, like the sweeping tax legislation before it, Trump’s infrastructure plan is designed to appear like it is solving some pressing policy issue while in reality, it is a way to further enrich special interests.

For starters, Trump’s proposal does not allocate adequate funding to truly resolve the infrastructure crisis. In fact, the plan doesn’t even begin to approach the amount of investment necessary to bring our infrastructure back to a satisfactory state. According to the ASCE, $4.59 trillion would be required to bring our composite infrastructure score from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/09/engineers-give-americas-infrastructure-a-near-failing-grade.html">a D+ to a B.</a> While Democrats, for their part, have not proposed such an ambitious spending package either, the White House’s plan does not solve the issue it sets out to solve.

What’s more, the plan’s methods for repairing our infrastructure are ineffective. The proposal, touted as a $1.5 trillion investment in public infrastructure, in reality only seeks to allocate $200 billion in federal spending. State and local governments are expected to match federal spending by a four-to-one ratio, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/11/news/economy/trump-infrastructure-plan-details/index.html">according to CNN.</a> If state and local governments were capable of allocating so much money toward infrastructure projects in the first place, it is unlikely their roads and bridges would have been languishing for as long as they have been. Placing the bulk of the spending burden on state and local governments, then, is not an effective approach to resolving this issue.

Yet these are all questions of policy that could be resolved if those proposing the plan were acting in good faith. Unfortunately, the most troubling aspect of the plan demonstrates that policymakers in the White House are not bona fide supporters of our nation’s infrastructure. The plan crucially proposes that infrastructure funding would take the form of private projects subsidized via tax credits, as opposed to projects directly managed and funded by the government. While this arrangement may be desirable in some situations, it is certainly not an effective way to repair infrastructure nationally. This is because private firms lack the incentive to repair infrastructure in many of the areas that most desperately need it. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “(private investment) would not deliver many of the most important needed projects for roads and bridges, public transit, schools and <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/trump-infrastructure-plan-far-less-than-the-claimed-1-trillion-in-new">public housing…”</a> Without some way of ensuring these companies focus on projects in areas where they are most needed, rather than where they are most profitable, the plan will not only fail to repair most of our nation’s most seriously wanting infrastructure but will hasten an infrastructure gap between different parts of the country. And, unsurprisingly, the plan, according to the CBPP, will simply benefit these private construction companies, which “would own the projects, get huge federal tax credits equal to a <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/trump-infrastructure-plan-far-less-than-the-claimed-1-trillion-in-new">stunning 82 percent of their equity investment and make profits from the tolls or fees they would charge to consumers.”</a>

Our nation is seriously in need of major public investment in our infrastructure. Aside from serving as a reminder that the world’s richest country is run by a government so dysfunctional that it is willing to let its infrastructure languish in disrepair for decades, the sorry state of our roads and bridges is also <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/falling-apart-america-neglected-infrastructure/">costly and dangerous</a>. President Trump has an opportunity here: Many Democrats have expressed a willingness to work with him on infrastructure, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/wonk/wp/2018/01/10/trump-might-have-just-opened-the-door-to-an-infrastructure-deal-with-democrats/">Washington Post</a>, and Republicans seem to have suspended their aversion to deficits. Many voters have expressed widespread support for a sweeping infrastructure plan, according<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/donald-trump-poll-spending-defense-infrastructure/index.html?adkey=bn"> to a CNN poll.</a> There is perhaps no easier political win for a president that is in desperate need of one before this year’s midterm season. But, to the disappointment of armchair infrastructure enthusiasts everywhere, Trump and his administration will very likely squander the opportunity. Instead, we can look forward to a polarizing bill that merely rewards large corporations, neglecting our roads and bridges for the foreseeable future.

		<title>Miller &#039;19: Why we can’t call that treason</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Feb. 5, 2018, President Donald Trump remarked to the Sheffer Corporation in Cincinnati that the Democrats’ failure to stand and applaud during his 2018 State of the Union address to Congress amounted to treason. Trump is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/05/politics/donald-trump-democrats-treasonous/index.html">quoted</a> by CNN as saying that the Democrats “were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said, ‘treasonous.’ I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much.”

Trump’s remarkably blunt stream of consciousness is ill-informed and demonstrates again that he lacks a basic understanding of the U.S. Constitution, which he has sworn to uphold.

Here’s a quick roadmap — Article III of the U.S. Constitution defines “treason.” It is the only crime that is specifically defined in the Constitution: “Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.” The colonies had recently fought to separate from England where charges of treason were used to silence dissidents. The drafters of our Constitution intended that grounds for treason be expressly defined and, in doing so, narrowed its use to specific circumstances so that an ambiguous characterization could not be politicized as a weapon to silence opposing views. Since 1789, charges of treason have been few and far between, with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/02/06/treason-dissing-president-trump-its-not-heres-what-is/?utm_term=.fff9dc642397">only forty</a> federal prosecutions and even fewer convictions. Brown students — and the population at large — need to understand that injudicious use of the word treason threatens the bedrock of our very democracy.

The Democrats’ decision not to stand for Trump during his address, whether appropriate or otherwise, undoubtedly does not fit within the definition of the crime described in Article III. And Trump’s claim of “not loving our country very much” is nothing more than his subjective displeasure at what he observed: a time-honored tradition of dissent from those “across the aisle.” So commonplace is Trump’s ego-centric criticism that we have become inured to it, and find it closer to the annoying buzzing of a mosquito than to a fundamental threat to our freedom. Yet are we underestimating the danger? Is Trump just reckless with words, or has he intentionally misappropriated and misapplied the crime of treason to stifle criticism? Those on Brown’s politically-minded and intellectually grounded campus are equipped to make their own decisions on Trump. But I advise awareness that he is not the only one to haphazardly throw constitutionally-derived firecrackers into the mix. Indeed, several others, on both sides of the aisle, are guilty of the same offense as their president: labeling an act or deed as treasonous without having legal justification for their assertion. Are they too just engaging in polemics or is there enough at stake to make this commentary more than just cavil?

This controversy has come to the forefront in light of possible Russian collusion in the 2016 election. People from all sides of the political spectrum, from Sen. Tim <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/tim-kaine-donald-trump-jr/index.html">Kaine</a> D-VA to Steve <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/politics/bannon-wolff-fire-and-fury/index.html">Bannon</a>, have used the word “treasonous” to describe Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer to get information on opponent Hillary Clinton. Though less blatant than Trump’s misuse, this too is inconsistent with the treason described in the Constitution. The key word in the context of the Constitution is enemy. Treason laws have narrowly defined enemy as those with which the United States is in an open or declared war. Although the elasticity of our Constitution may allow for a broader definition, it is likely that at the time, the framers meant to encompass only other sovereign countries with which we are at war. Under this definition, while the United States is “in competition” with Russia, we are formally at peace with it. There are other acts and laws which may be or have been violated, but the alleged collusion with Russia does not fit into the constitutional rubric of treason. And to use it in that manner lessens its import and undermines, in a “crying wolf” manner, its proper and more serious application. There is nothing banal about what is meant by treason, and the voices of those who disagree with us are not the intended target, no matter how disagreeable our opponents’ actions or inactions may be.

As the framers intended, accusations of treasonous behavior leave no room for hyperbole. Gaining traction in an argument certainly does not justify corrupting fundamental tenets of our constitution. Brown students need to be cognizant of the historical background of our words, and scrupulously accurate when accusing a political opponent of any form of treason or other serious crime. According to our framers, to do otherwise may endanger our democratic processes.

		<title>Mulligan &#039;19: There’s more to identity than politics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Feb. 13, 2018, the Brown Republicans and the Watson Center for International Affairs hosted Guy Benson, who was described as “a political editor at Townhall, frequent Fox News contributor and prominent young voice in the conservative movement.” Their description left out the reason why Benson has been making headlines recently: He partnered with PragerU, a conservative video production platform, to create a video called “I’m Gay … Conservative … So What?” The title succinctly sums up the video’s contents: Benson spends five minutes telling viewers how being gay is not an important part of his political identity, and rallies for more people with marginalized identities to step up and be their true, conservative selves.

I had never heard of Benson before he spoke on campus, I didn’t go to his talk and frankly, I don’t care that much about him in particular. What I care about more is the problem underscored by his headline-making video. Figures like Benson become sensationalized, as shown by the over 770,000  views on his video, because they contradict popular ideas about how personal identities should intersect with political identities. Yet there are always going to be people who believe their politics are separate from other aspects of their identity. Assuming that identity validates a belief more than developing critically thought-out arguments is incorrect, demonstrated in part by the ever-present so-called dissenting voices from people who hold the same identity. It’s time to focus on politicians’ actions, not on the demographics of their supporters.

I’m not arguing that a person’s background is irrelevant to their political beliefs. Understanding how someone has been impacted by different issues illuminates the sources of their perspectives: If a multibillionaire doesn’t care about SNAP benefits but an unemployed single mother does, then it’s understandable why a commentator would contextualize their background when presenting their views. The latter person is far more likely to be directly affected by policy changes. We are all shaped by our identities and our experiences, and those shouldn’t be treated as irrelevant when assessing the validity of a claim.

But a person’s background shouldn’t be the main factor used in evaluating their political beliefs. In his video, Benson asserts that many other gay people think he must be “self-hating” to support a party whose platform has largely been unsupportive of LGBTQ+ rights. He calls this claim “intellectually lazy.” And although I don’t think I’d agree with Benson on anything else, he is right. Dismissing Benson’s conservative politics as a form of internalized homophobia is a form of the “No True Scotsman” fallacy: Critics are saying that no true self-actualized gay person would support the Republican Party. This claim is completely unsubstantiated, and its adherence to a common rhetorical flaw makes it easy to tear down. There’s just no evidence that Benson, or any other LGBTQ+ Republicans, are conservative because of internalized homophobia. To say otherwise moves political discourse away from how public policy harms certain groups, and focuses instead on the notion that if we could just teach people to love themselves, then they would support different politicians.

Not only is that argument logically unsupportable, it’s also easy to offer evidence to the contrary. When people act as though no one who holds a marginalized identity would ever support conservative stances, then conservatives can just point to the many people with diverse backgrounds who do, in fact, support them. In terms of sexuality, it’s easy to name Benson, his contemporary young gay conservative, Milo Yiannopoulos, or organizations like the <a href="http://www.logcabin.org/ ">Log Cabin Republicans</a> as foils. Suggesting that only the rich support Republicans ignores the rural poor who were so key in electing Trump. Bring in racial minorities, and you get stories like the man who held the “Blacks for Trump” sign behind Trump’s podium during a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/23/the-strange-story-of-that-blacks-for-trump-guy-standing-behind-potus-at-his-phoenix-rally/?utm_term=.a96fb32a4a1e">rally</a> in Phoenix in August 2017. People whose political beliefs appear to contradict the interests of an identity group of which they are a part have always existed, and will always exist.

Easily-contradicted claims that link political positions to people’s identities do little besides distract from the actual issues at hand. Trump isn’t unsupportive of the LGBTQ+ community because a lot of LGBTQ+ people believe that he is. He’s unsupportive because he’s made policy decisions that go against the best interests of LGBTQ+ people, such as erasing Obama-era <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/us/politics/devos-sessions-transgender-students-rights.html ">guidelines</a> to protect transgender students and taking <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/7/27/16049306/trump-sessions-justice-department-lgbtq">steps</a> to allow federal workers to be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation. Accusing LGBTQ+ people who do support Trump of self-hatred does nothing to change his actions. It just provides conservatives with a valid talking point to distract from his political record.

Identity isn’t irrelevant. But it also, on its own, does not make an argument for why a politician should or shouldn’t be supported, and insisting that it does is a weak and easily dispelled argument. Benson’s video shouldn’t be sensationalized. We need to stop focusing on who politicians are supported by and instead channel our energy into criticizing the politicians themselves.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After a year that even the creators of South Park found impossible to parody — with “<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-02/donald-trump-too-hard-to-satirise-say-trey-parker-and-matt-stone/8236338">satire becom(ing) reality</a>” — current events have lost their ability to shock us, and something of a formula has formed. As attentive and impassioned students, we see the way things are, we measure our dissatisfaction, we react. But a realization struck me last month as I witnessed the conglomerate of pink that consumed streets and social media feeds across the nation, this year’s Women’s March. Robust voices engulfed cities, an undeniable sense of community buzzed … and the garbage can on the corner of 72nd Street was totally overflowing. Those passing by seemed to dismiss the swamp of wrappers, signs and napkins that cluttered the surrounding concrete and instead threw their water bottles about three feet away from the actual trash can.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I found a symbolism in this sight that has been difficult to shake. It poses a question that is hard to ignore: Are we hyperfocusing on certain issues and thereby ignoring crucial others — in this case, the basic decency that comes with throwing out one’s trash properly? In our activism, we are attentive and determined and firm. However, when we simultaneously display an inability to properly respect our surroundings, we suggest that our intense care does not extend to the somewhat simpler measures that better our local communities.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We fight for social causes that promote inclusivity and generosity and try to ensure that all human beings are treated with dignity and respect. We need to make sure we are advocating for these very themes in our everyday lives at Brown and thinking just as much about individual impact as changing the world. If we aren’t being kind to our dorm neighbors and classmates and lab partners, how can we retain our credibility in our spirited marches and fiery debates? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I worry about the collateral damage of this hyperfocused mindset — one that neglects the necessity of practicing in our daily lives the values for which we march. In nearly three years at Brown, I have encountered more thrilling rallies and impassioned speeches than I ever had in the eighteen years before. At the same time, I have observed the metaphorical overflowing trash cans of our campus: members of such a socially aware student body neglecting each other or foregoing opportunities to be kind to those around them. Taking the time to thank Brown Dining Services workers or to say hi to a classmate rather than walking right past them are two of the many ways we can foster an environment of the same kindness we strive to create in the rest of the world. Rather than being trivial, these seemingly smaller acts are what will, incrementally, build the community we are trying to shape. They give us an opportunity to make tangible change and improve ourselves every day. Moreover, the impact that they have far outweighs the minimal effort that goes into them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I don’t say this to minimize the aims of monumental and urgent social movements, which extend much further than the steps I lay out here. I am constantly blown away by the power of my peers’ activism. The care we put into these endeavors is nothing short of amazing. However, I do think that if we want to become better activists and people, we should also expend some of this energy locally on our supposedly mundane interactions with the people around us. Kindness won’t dismantle the systemic inequalities that pervade our society and inspire us to action, but it can have a profound impact on an individual’s life. On a campus where it’s easy to feel ineffective or invisible, you never know how much the smallest effort on your part can mean to someone else. We should hold ourselves to the same standards of commitment, every day, that we demand of ourselves in our vital marches. How we treat the people around us is not secondary to how we fight for larger causes; rather, it can bolster our ability to be inclusive and mindful in our activism. This activism is essential, but if we lose our values amid these efforts, we might forget what grounded us in these core beliefs in the first place.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Shaun White is becoming a household name again for the first time in four years, I can finally say with confidence that the Winter Olympics are back in full swing. White, whose back-to-back 1440-degree spins won him his third career gold medal in the men’s halfpipe Wednesday, represents the fourth American gold medal winner thus far in the Pyeongchang games. Oddly enough, the other three American golds also came from snowboarders: Red Gerard and Jamie Anderson for slopestyle and Chloe Kim <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/took-united-states-94-years-win-100-winter-olympics-gold-medals-heres-every-single-one-031212792.html">for halfpipe.</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As two of the American golds came from historically-young Red Gerard and Chloe Kim, both 17 years old, Brown students who are 18 years and older have to ponder what they’ve actually accomplished with their extra years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But the Pyeongchang Olympics are historic not only for the impressive athletic performances underway, but also for their significance in the possible unification of the divided Korean Peninsula. The Olympics are theoretically apolitical but notoriously political anyway, and the 2018 Olympics are no different. Concerningly, North Korea has seized this moment in an attempt to whitewash its inhumane regime by making inauthentic gestures at diplomacy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">North Korea did not hold back with its unanticipated showmanship as it deployed a platoon of cheerleaders this past Monday in support of the joint Korean women’s hockey team in its match against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/sports/olympics/north-korean-cheerleaders.html">Sweden</a>. In addition, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent his sister, Kim Yo-jong, (also known as “North Korea’s Ivanka Trump”) as an emissary to sway the opinion of South Koreans during the opening ceremony and hockey match. Of course, the Trump administration could not remain consistent — Vice President Mike Pence disrespectfully remained seated during a standing ovation for the joint Korean hockey team on<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/world/asia/kim-yo-jong-mike-pence-olympics.html"> Sunday</a>, while just two days later President Trump entertained the idea of talks with North Korea despite its resistance to eliminating its nuclear<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/world/asia/north-korea-pence-talks.html"> stockpile</a>. This inconsistency only plays into North Korea’s hands as it continues its propaganda campaign to curry international favor throughout the Olympics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/opinion/ivanka-north-korea-.html">Frank Bruni</a> thoughtfully pointed out in a New York Times column this week, this public relations routine on the part of North Korea has been woefully successful. The governments of South Korea and the United States were charmed into forgetting that North Korea still practices public executions and starves its citizens long enough to initiate peace talks. Kim Yo-jong even achieved a measure of internet fame for the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliareinstein/kim-jong-un-sister-kim-yo-jong?utm_term=.dtvDNxzXD9#.eqAk4VOnkL">“deadly side-eye”</a> she apparently gave Vice President Pence, leading many on social media to overlook her complicity in her brother’s dictatorship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why is this allowed to happen? Whether Korean reunification is a good idea or not is a different matter, but the Olympics should not serve as the propaganda platform that launches the discussion. North Korea should have to entice the United States and South Korea into peace talks on its own political merit, not on the beguiling charm of a last-minute diplomat. Though I don’t want to be dramatic, I am tempted to say “now more than ever” — it seems as though the subtext of the Olympics has never overshadowed the underlying athletic achievements <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/13/steinman-19-time-cautious-optimism/">more than now.</a> The coverage of North Korea’s new public image has been just as dominant as that of the sports results, medal counts and athlete biographies that usually comprise most Olympic coverage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Olympics have been used to paint authoritarian regimes in a less threatening light before. When Nazi Germany hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Adolf Hitler utilized the platform as a way to sway international opinion in favor of his anti-Semitic, white supremacist ideals. Eighty years later, though North Korea is not the host of these games, Kim Jong-un is similarly attempting to soften his reputation and that of his government by taking advantage of the South’s initiative to present a more unified vision of the peninsula.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">If North Korea wants to improve its international standing, it should take steps toward genuinely improving its citizens’ quality of life by reducing censorship, promoting human rights and ending its warmongering campaigns rather than by partaking in meaningless and distracting pseudo-diplomacy. The United States, and the rest of the world, should accept nothing less than tangible change when considering further cooperation with this volatile, authoritarian state.</span></p>

		<title>Thomas &#039;21: Connecting the Ivory Tower to the real world</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The classes I’m taking this semester have me circling back to this one thought: How applicable is the stuff I’m learning in the classroom to the real world? We’re so fortunate to attend a place like Brown. Only a small minority of us will ever get the chance to receive a college education, live in an intellectual environment and explore many of our interests without fear of professional failure. But the work we do in academia might not serve its ultimate purpose — of shaping the world around us for the better — if it excludes or alienates people who don’t have the privilege of being able to afford a degree. The broader purpose of the university and the knowledge developed there — as distinct from service work or community outreach — is to push society forward. But we can’t do that if society as a whole — particularly those who don’t have the privilege of secondary or postsecondary education — is left uninvolved in the production and consumption of that knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are different ways in which “academic knowledge” — the kind of theoretical discourse and inquiry that professors write about and students are assigned as course readings — fails to translate in the real world. Let’s take structural racism, for example. The study of this system is performed largely by academics working to understand why and how people of color are subjected to structural disadvantages. While this information can be used by some to help address oppressive practices, those whose experience with structural racism is less abstract and more experiential ultimately get the short end of the stick. If you went up to someone on the street and asked them if they understood how structural racism was operating on them, they might not be able to offer the kind of response that would be deemed “articulate” in some college classrooms — or they might not have even heard of the term before. In this instance, there’s a disconnect between the way we, as college students, talk about an issue and the way that issue functions in real life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another example of the inapplicability of “academic knowledge” is the difficulty of bringing information from the classroom into everyday conversation. You might have been in a situation where a friend or relative back home says something harmful that you feel needs to be addressed. But, in moments like these, trying to correct your friend can come off as condescending, because the kind of discourse promoted on college campuses assumes a basic understanding of social justice that hasn’t actually been afforded to everyone. These examples point to the importance of bridging the gap between academia and the real world — especially when it comes to issues of equity and justice. If the work being done in the academy is producing knowledge that’s only accessible to those within the academy, how much good can possibly come from it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a student studying the humanities and social sciences, I’ve been inundated with articles and books tackling complex and important topics. And while I feel like I’m grasping the information — as is expected of a Brown student — I often wonder how my understanding of these topics can actually be helpful to someone experiencing something like inequality in the educational system firsthand. As it turns out, I’m not the only one questioning academia’s purpose. According to one <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/20/republicans-skeptical-of-colleges-impact-on-u-s-but-most-see-benefits-for-workforce-preparation/">study</a>, 58 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe that colleges and universities negatively impact our country. Although there are other factors contributing to this number, that so many Americans are skeptical of higher education still reflects a negative perception of academia’s place in society. Clearly, the relevance of the university and “academic knowledge” to the real world isn’t evident to a lot of people — and this unfortunate pattern has to be recognized and rectified. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact of the matter is that outside of Brown, the world looks very different. While on College Hill we might encounter readings by Kimberlé Crenshaw and Michel Foucault, outside of the Van Wickle Gates, over <a href="http://www.begintoread.com/research/literacystatistics.html">70 percent</a> of prison inmates cannot read above a fourth-grade level. And, though we may think that racism can’t possibly persist on Brown’s campus, just last week <a href="http://www.begintoread.com/research/literacystatistics.html">racist flyers</a> were posted near Brook and George Streets. With these realities in mind, we must remind ourselves of the true purpose of higher education — producing knowledge that helps people and creates change in the real world, not just in classrooms — and critically determine whether or not this purpose is being achieved. While Brown has taken significant steps to enhance the community-oriented nature of many courses, the Brown bubble remains a prominent feature of academic life here. And if we cut ourselves off from life outside of that bubble and talk about the world’s problems in abstract terms, it’s difficult to see any real change coming about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This past weekend I attended the Black Solidarity Conference at Yale. The “solidarity” of this conference was rooted not in our commonalities as college students immersed in academia. Rather, it was the experiences and personal stories that were shared by those at the conference that really resonated with us and brought us all closer together. Everyone in attendance was allowed and empowered to share from their own lives, rather than regurgitating what they’d read in a certain text for a class. The value of these contributions was just as significant and powerful as anything any theorist anywhere could write. With this honest, experience-based storytelling comes a tremendous ability to mobilize people to solve important issues instead of just discussing them. It became clear to me that the most effective knowledge isn’t always academic, or rooted in complicated philosophical texts — it can take the form of lived experience, and we should value it as highly as any essay or dissertation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of day, members of academia have to consistently ask themselves this question: What is the point of learning about the problems of the world if the world is excluded from the change-making process? Developing knowledge that has the potential to be helpful but making it inaccessible to those who need it the most renders that knowledge unproductive. We must remember that life outside of academia is very different. As such, researchers studying the experiences of people should do more to make sure that the research they do is beneficial to those they’re researching. For instance, if you’re studying a problematic dynamic within a specific community and you find evidence to support your hypothesis, you’re obligated to do more than publish your paper and revel in the accuracy of your research. You should try to take steps to help the community to remedy the problem, instead of simply studying it and returning to the ivory tower to have your conclusions circulated exclusively amongst academics. Only by identifying our own privileges as members of academia and by committing ourselves to supporting vulnerable communities can we start to bridge the gap between academia and the real world and fulfill the promise of the university. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Cleveland Cavaliers hit rock bottom just nine days ago. In an 18-point loss to the horrible Orlando Magic, the Cavaliers looked old, unmotivated and selfish. Many wrote the team off as title contenders, especially in light of Cleveland’s 32-point blowout loss to the Houston Rockets the weekend before. But little did we know that in nine days’ time, the Cavs would be one of the hottest teams in the NBA and favorites once again to reach the Finals. With consecutive victories over the Boston Celtics and Oklahoma City Thunder, it is safe to say that the Cavaliers are back.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Feb. 8, hours before the trading deadline, General Manager Koby Altman agreed to trades that dramatically altered the course of Cleveland’s season. After three deals, out were Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Iman Shumpert, Channing Frye, Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose. To Cleveland, meanwhile, came George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. Incredibly, half the team had changed in the space of an hour. More incredibly, it seems to have worked.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The losses of Thomas and Crowder were additions by subtractions already. Thomas had worn out his welcome in Cleveland thanks to an inability to keep his mouth shut. Calling out teammates and talking candidly to reporters is fine for someone playing like an MVP candidate. But needless to say, Thomas’ comments, such as, “When adversity hits, we go our separate ways,” were not well-received by fans and other Cavaliers while he was averaging 14.7 points per game on dreadful 36.1 percent shooting from the floor. LeBron James dispassionately stood around watching Thomas miss shot after shot, with perceptible derision in his eyes. Cavaliers fans booed him off the court after his woeful performances. Reporters hounded the point guard after games.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Crowder, like Thomas, was not th</span><span class="s1">e same player that he was in Boston. He never found a rhythm in Cleveland and struggled to make even open layups, let alone three-pointers. In the aftermath of the trades, reporters described Thomas and Crowder standing off in the corner of the locker room away from their other teammates. The two players were only dragging the rest of the team down and had to go.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wade, Rose, Frye and Shumpert were not big losses either, though their interactions with the other Cavaliers were far more peaceful. Cleveland lacked the athleticism and energy to compete with the league’s best — and none of these players were helping.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Clarkson and Nance have plenty of youth and explosiveness, however. Nance hits the boards with unbridled enthusiasm, winning the team extra possessions. His eight offensive rebounds against OKC were big reasons why the Cavaliers came out victorious in the tough road game. Clarkson, meanwhile, can create his own shot and drive quickly to the basket. He fulfills the role that a 36-year-old Wade was trying his best to manage, and the difference is noticeable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rodney Hood and George Hill, on the other hand, can make the three-pointers that Thomas and Crowder were missing, while providing much-needed defense. Even the players that were already on the team have been impacted positively by the four new guys. J.R. Smith is shooting the ball well for the first time all season, and his activity all over the floor has improved. James has refocused and has stopped turning the ball over so much — he put up 37 points, eight assists and eight rebounds against the Thunder. Cedi Osman, inserted into the starting lineup, has been a revelation. The rookie from Turkey has hustled his way into fan-favorite status.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kevin Love is not even on the court right now because of his hand injury, and the Cavaliers are beating some of the league’s top teams. When their all-star forward is back, Cleveland will be more dangerous than ever — and no Eastern Conference team will be favored over this bunch.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Toronto Raptors stand on top right now heading into the All-Star break. But this is a story we have seen before. The offensive system may incorporate more ball movement and three-pointers than in previous years, but the important personnel remains the same. The Raptors have a deep bench, but that becomes less important in playoff games when rotations shrink. DeMar Derozan and Kyle Lowry will decide this team’s fate, and with Lowry having a down season (16.5 PPG, 6.4 APG, 5.7 RPG), I wouldn’t bet on their chances.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Boston Celtics have hit a wall, as their recurring offensive struggles are finally starting to lose them games. Kyrie Irving is terrific, Al Horford is the x-factor and Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are exciting young players, but will the Celtics score enough to last deep into the playoffs? Judging off their past few games against worthy opponents, the answer is no.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And who else remains — the Washington Wizards? Milwaukee Bucks? Philadelphia 76ers? Make no mistake, Cleveland is the best team here.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, the Golden State Warriors are still out there and would beat any Eastern Conference team in four or five games, but let’s leave that problem for a later article. The Cavaliers are just too much fun right now to worry about Steph, KD, Klay and Dray.</span></p>

		<title>Savello &#039;18: The elitism of Senior Week</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">I remember hearing wonderful things when I was an underclassman about Senior Week, the week of activities that takes place between final exams and graduation. From the Unit Wars to the mixers and dances, everything sounded like a fun way for seniors to kick off their final days at Brown, and for years, I looked forward to attending a Senior Week of my own. But what I wasn’t told was how expensive Senior Week is.</p>
<p class="p3">A few days ago, I received an email from the Class Coordinating Board listing the prices of the “Senior Week packages,” which are $210 per person for the regular packages and $160 for those who are under 21. The financial aid packages, by comparison, cost half the standard price. However, even $105 is a lot for someone to spend on graduation festivities, and I began to wonder what a student should do if they’re not able to afford any of the packages.</p>
<p class="p3">According to the CCB website, there are nine free events, including the “Brown’s Finest” talent show, Unit Wars and Pizza Lunch, the Andrew Evans Magic Show and the Ice Cream Social, to name a few. There are also a variety of events you can choose to individually purchase without buying the whole package. However, many of these events seem overpriced with respect to the activity. For example, Class Day, which involves a barbecue and Dave Binder concert, costs $30 to attend and “Last Meal at the Ratty,” which entails a combination of Ratty dishes, beer options and a DJ, costs $40. Even with the beer and the DJ, anyone who’s eaten at the Ratty knows that its food is not worth anything near $40.</p>
<p class="p3">There are also three “classy” events for package holders only: a wine and cheese mixer, a craft beer tasting and a casino night at Mohegan Sun. These events are only for the people who purchased packages, and there is no option for someone to pay for these individual events if they really wanted to go. This is problematic and elitist — it penalizes the non-package holders for not paying the whole price and fosters an exclusive atmosphere surrounding these events.</p>
<p class="p3">These pricing choices are questionable on many levels and seem to go against Brown’s own stated goal of giving students equal opportunities. There is a time and place to charge students for activities, such as Gala and formals, which are not something every single student has the desire to go to. But graduation is a universal experience for all students, and they shouldn’t be denied access to the activities because of their financial background. When Senior Week activities are prohibitively priced, seniors will find other activities outside of the planned events, which further divides the class. During a time when we should be celebrating our collective accomplishment, it is ironic and painful to see our class split along financial lines.</p>
<p class="p3">On top of these Senior Week activities, graduation is already an expensive time for most Brown students and their families. Between cap and gown prices, senior photos, elevated hotel costs, heightened restaurant prices and travel expenses, the whole experience of graduating can cause financial strain for many. Furthermore, graduation is especially concerning for those who don’t have lucrative jobs lined up or who are faced with mountains of student loans. Brown is only adding fuel to the fire with these Senior Week packages, forcing students to make decisions based on financial practicality instead of desire.</p>
<p class="p3">All of this begs the question: Does Brown really want us to remember our last week here as a stressful financial balancing act? Graduation is supposed to be a time to celebrate your achievements and hang out with your peers for the last time — not a time to worry about whether or not you can afford to attend the same events as your friends.</p>
<p class="p3">To combat these issues, Brown should take steps toward making the Senior Week festivities more affordable. There are already many free events available, but for the pricier events, perhaps Brown can work toward reducing prices through fundraising or by soliciting volunteer workers. Freshman Orientation, for example, is run entirely by student volunteers, which significantly reduces labor costs. For some of the activities of Senior Week that are for students over 21, student volunteers would not be ideal, but it would be worth extending volunteer opportunities to faculty, staff and alumni who are willing to help out.</p>
<p class="p3">Another idea is to make the three package-holder-only events open to non-package-holders as well. Obviously, students may not want to go to all of these events, but they should at least have the option to go to the ones they want to regardless of whether they can afford the full package. Brown should also consider getting rid of some of the pricier events altogether to help create more equitable opportunities. After all, students can go off and pursue these more expensive activities on their own without the University’s implicit endorsement of class divisions.</p>
<p class="p3">At the end of the day, graduation is an experience Brown students will remember for the rest of their lives, so Brown should reconsider the opportunities they are providing and what kind of environment these exclusive events create. Perhaps instead of focusing on fancy, exclusive events, the University can focus on creating what really matters: an enjoyable final week well-spent with peers.</p>

		<title>Aman &#039;20: Rethinking the Fight for 15</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/50796/411295-Keeping-the-Neighborhood-Affordable.PDF">On Feb. 8, progressive Democrats in the Rhode Island General Assembly, including Aaron Regunberg ’12, unveiled their 2018 “Fair Shot Agenda.”</a> This legislative package prioritizes “passing a budget that protects our neighbors,” “investing in school facilities,” providing high-quality care for seniors and, last but not least, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023. Yet, while it is crucial to ensure every Rhode Islander has a fair shot in life, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour will likely hurt the very people it is intended to help.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is true that research on the effects of modest minimum wage increases on unemployment is decidedly mixed. Some studies find that modest minimum wage increases cause modest increases in unemployment, while some find no effect at all. For example, a Congressional Budget Office study found that increasing the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour would increase pay for 16 to 24 million Americans, while eliminating about half a million jobs. While the research is far from clear, many policymakers have reasonably concluded that the benefits of modest minimum wage increases outweigh any potential costs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But there is very little research on the more drastic minimum wage hikes undertaken in recent years to create a living wage in the long term, in states such as <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm">California</a> and <a href="http://www.lni.wa.gov/WorkplaceRights/Wages/Minimum/">Washington</a>, and cities like <a href="https://www.govdocs.com/san-francisco-2015-minimum-wage-increase/">San Francisco</a> and <a href="http://murray.seattle.gov/minimumwage/">Seattle</a>. A living wage ranges from $12 to $17.50 an hour, increases the minimum wage in most places by 50 to 100 percent and allows earners to sustain themselves without government assistance. The only study of this kind of minimum wage hike, which analyzes Seattle’s then-$13 minimum wage, found that employers reacted to the wage hike by decreasing hours for their workers, leading to lower take-home pay on average for low-wage workers. While proponents of a living wage have been quick to point out issues with this study — namely, that it is still in the process of peer review — we should be concerned that the only study on drastic minimum wage increases suggests that these sorts of increases lead to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/02/05/raising-the-minimum-wage-doesnt-cost-jobs-multiple-studies-suggest/?utm_term=.1a92f3258e2b">lower take-home pay</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Furthermore, even if a $13 minimum wage worked in Seattle, there is no reason we should expect it to work in Rhode Island. Seattle has a booming economy and a highly-skilled workforce. Rhode Island, on the other hand, is ranked <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm">31st</a> in the United States for unemployment, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/best-states-for-business/list/#tab:overall_search:rhode">43rd</a> for business friendliness and <a href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/states/">37th</a> for population growth in 2018. Additionally, raising the minimum wage at the state level may simply encourage businesses to move across state lines, according to the Brookings Institution. As a small state with competitive neighbors, Rhode Island is especially vulnerable. For example, Massachusetts, which is ranked <a href="https://www.mass.gov/guides/massachusetts-law-about-minimum-wage">16th</a> in unemployment, 19th in business friendliness and 24th in population growth, currently has a minimum wage of $11 an hour. Raising the minimum wage to $15 will make it increasingly difficult for Rhode Island to keep up.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This isn’t to say that the government should not work to ensure everyone has enough to provide for themselves and their families. But putting the entire burden on private businesses big and small to pay a living wage will likely cause more harm than good. Instead, in addition to implementing modest minimum wage hikes — which Rhode Island has already written into law, as the minimum wage is <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170622/house-votes-to-raise-rhode-islands-minimum-wage">slated to increase</a> to $10.50 an hour in 2019 from $9.60 an hour before 2018 — local governments should work to encourage growth and expand opportunity for all. For example, investing in public education, which is part of the 2018 “Fair Shot Agenda,” is crucial in order to ensure equal opportunity for all children, and to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/fixing-public-schools-for-a-better-economy/419526/">prepare the next generation for high paying jobs</a>. Further, policies streamlining permits and licenses will <a href="https://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/streamlined-permitting-licensing-599">improve the state’s business climate</a> and help small businesses thrive. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, because households in the lower third of the income distribution <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2016/03/household-expenditures-and-income">spend about 40 percent of their income on housing</a>, local governments should use innovative tools like inclusionary zoning — the allocation of some residential units to low- and middle-income families — and housing trust funds <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/50796/411295-Keeping-the-Neighborhood-Affordable.PDF">to grow and maintain the affordable housing stock</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Supporters of a $15 minimum wage argue that people working full time should be able to support themselves. I agree. Like those who support a $15 minimum wage, I believe in using policy to create a fairer and more equitable world. But we need to think critically about how policies intended to be fair will work in practice, and a $15 minimum wage will ultimately hurt the low-wage workers it intends to help. While “Fight for incremental minimum wage increases while carefully watching unemployment, encouraging growth and expanding opportunity” is not as catchy as “Fight for 15,” at the end of the day, sensible, nuanced policymaking will enable us to achieve our shared goals of equity, justice and opportunity for all.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Marvel’s “Black Panther” came out last weekend, and it lived up to its highly anticipated greatness. The excitement around the movie stems from two factors: Audiences get yet another heart-racing movie from Marvel, but more importantly, its themes, images and overall portrayal of Blackness are beautifully moving. King T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) of the fictional African country Wakanda arrives at a moral crossroads when his country, under the control of a usurper, is about to start a world war. In a dramatic turn of events, T’Challa is able to regain control and return order to his land and the world at large. Notably, the role of Black women is a key component of why T’Challa is so successful in his endeavors. For its game-changing plot and depiction of women, “Black Panther” — released during Black History Month — is a must-see for everyone and a huge milestone for the Black community.</span></p>
<p class="p3">For starters, the Black women in this movie straight-up handle business. Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), T’Challa’s sister, sustains the country with her scientific advancements and use of technology to create the country’s energy, weapons and clothing. Wakandan spy Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) and commander Okoye (Danai Gurira) — in addition to the army of Black women warriors who fight alongside the king — practically constitute T’Challa’s spine, given how much support and protection they offer him. At the same time, both Nakia and Okoye retain their own ambitions and stick to their own convictions in their service to the king. They consistently choose their own principles throughout the movie and do not waver just because His Highness requests something of them. This self-assertion is extremely important because, while service is a pillar of their role to the king, the women of “Black Panther” also provide indispensable advice and guidance to T’Challa. Nakia and Okoye serve as a reminder to all women, especially Black women, that you don’t have to give up on your own personal goals to make a difference in the grand scheme of your country. Plus, it’s always nice when the lead women keep their clothes on and have more than three lines in a movie because women are more than objects and they can contribute more to the story than their subservience.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Another defining feature of “Black Panther” is its depiction of a prosperous Black country. Wakanda represents the goals that any sane modern-day country would try to achieve — a secure border, a sustainable and eco-friendly energy source and intelligent, beautiful and hardworking citizens. Plus, Wakanda flips the current social construct known as race and makes its white visitors, or all visitors really, come second to the Wakandan default, Black people. The interactions with CIA agent Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) provide an opposing view into the matrix of domination that usually inflicts hardships on Black folks. At one point, a Wakandan straight-up tells Agent Ross not to speak, which is something no Black person is accustomed to telling a white man in a position of power. All of this is to say that Wakanda changes the power dynamics of race, presents the possibilities of Black innovation and entertains the childish thought of “what would’ve been” if twelve to seventeen million bodies weren’t captured from Africa and entrapped in the transatlantic slave trade.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What’s perhaps as important as the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>portrayal of Black people killin’ the game in “Black Panther” is the timing of the movie. A February 2018 release date — during Black History Month, in a period of political unrest and renewed interest in racial equality — says almost as much as the two-hour movie itself. The movie’s title pays homage to the well-known Black Panther Party that historically sought equality for Black folks. Make no mistake, Marvel’s release of a majority Black-casted movie centered around a powerhouse country of Black people during Black History month is a well-calculated marketing strategy. “Black Panther” proved profitable: Its opening weekend broke box office records with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/02/19/black-panther-all-the-box-office-records-it-broke-and-almost-broke-in-its-242m-debut/#2741cd2e7195">$242 million</a> in revenue, which makes it the biggest launch of a solo superhero movie of all time. This method of using Blackness to make money is not new and is far from over. Usually, I’d be against this type of exploitation, but Marvel has proven that movies with Black leading actors and actresses — that uplift Black women, address the rifts between Africans and African Americans and showcase Black joy — can make nearly a quarter billion dollars in one weekend. “Black Panther” has shown that representation is profitable, and that there is no economic excuse for films that lack people of color or lowball the people of color they do portray. The lesson for Hollywood is clear: Paying for Blackness and representation is worth it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Themes such as these are central to “Black Panther,” and they are presented so effectively because Black people were calling the shots at every stage in the film’s production. (There are several specific lines throughout the movie that will jump out as being from the pen of a Black person.) The director, Ryan Coogler, is a Black man who brought together mostly people of color as his crew: Kendrick Lamar produced the soundtrack, Ruth Carter designed the costumes and the list goes on. “Black Panther” is a clear example of the fact that, when Black people hold decision-making positions in movies — or in the world at large — the end products turn out better. The moral of the story is simple: Go watch the movie, if for nothing else than to see images of strong Black women, depictions of a fervent Black country and a classic Marvel superhero story.</span></p>

		<title>Foster &#039;19: Against hackathons</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/27/foster-19-hackathons/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Hackathons seem to be the hot new thing. A portmanteau of “hack” and “marathon,” <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/hackathons.html">hackathons</a> began around the turn of the millennium when programmers gathered to solve problems related to sending data over a computer network.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the following decade, hackathons have gained traction in the tech world. During hackathons, groups of coders (and non-coders) get together to take a shot at making the next big thing. At the end of a long, energy-drink fueled weekend, they pitch their ideas to a panel of judges (or investors), and the winner receives a sum of money to further develop their pitch. Unfortunately, most of these ideas <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/the-secret-lives-of-hackathon-junkies/397895/">never leave the ground</a>. For the most part, hackathons produce nothing.</p>
<p class="p3">Today, hackathons are no longer restricted to the tech world. Earlier this school year, Brown hosted Brown Hack Health, a hackathon aiming to “develop tools to change the worlds of medicine and health,” according to its <a href="http://brownhackhealth.org">website</a>. In March, Brown will host “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/15/watson-to-host-hack-for-humanity/">Hack for Humanity</a>,” which intends to gather students together to explore solutions to problems emerging from the Rohingya refugee crisis.</p>
<p class="p3">We ought to be skeptical of the extent to which we can apply the tools of the tech industry to solve social problems. America’s health care delivery system is broken. Refugee crises are real and persistent. Social problems are caused by institutional failures, misaligned incentives and longstanding cultural issues. These problems can’t be solved with a flashy tech deliverable. To really fix contemporary crises, we need both systemic and policy change. This is the sort of thing that takes longer than a weekend.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Solving a problem requires us to immerse ourselves in the context in which it takes place. When we become deeply involved, we learn what the real constraints of a problem are. Consider some of the ideas pitched at <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/19/students-create-healthcare-solutions-hack-health/">Brown Hack Health</a> last fall. Teams aimed to create products to enhance doctor-patient trust, increase understanding of medication side effects and improve medication compliance in patients. We ought to ask ourselves — why do these problems exist in the first place? A confluence of factors have caused primary care appointments to become shorter in the last several decades. Pressure from hospital systems for doctors to see a high volume of patients have increased the number of appointments providers are expected to complete each day. Comparatively low reimbursement rates for providers have disincentivized entry into primary care. The result? Fewer doctors are left to see more patients in the same amount of time. The ten to fifteen minutes that constitute today’s doctor’s visits aren’t sufficient to build a trusting, personal relationship between patients and their physicians. Similarly, it’s unrealistic to expect that a doctor can effectively counsel patients about medications, review existing health problems, address current complaints and provide guidance about improving health behaviors all in such a short span of time. A new tech product might serve as a temporary relief, but it can’t resolve the underlying problem. An app will not be our saving grace.</span></p>
<p class="p3">I’m not entirely cynical. There’s value in gathering creative people together and getting them excited about making the world a better place. It’s important to dream up solutions to problems instead of doing nothing for fear that no single solution is perfect enough. At the same time, we ought to be skeptical of the hackathon model of problem solving as a viable platform for correcting the ills caused by failing systems. We ought to be honest and call a hackathon what it really is — something between a networking event and a skill-building session. Neither of these things is bad, but it’s dishonest to suggest that a hackathon is a place where problems really get solved. Change needs sustained engagement, and that’s something a frenzied bout of weekend coding can’t provide.</p>
<p class="p3">It’s tempting to give into the flashy promise of the tech world — with enough people and coffee and free t-shirts, we can disrupt anything, right? But if our goal is meaningful change, I propose the following: Let’s find the cause that we’re willing to show up for every week. Let’s get involved with a community. Let’s figure out the problems that exist, figure out what keeps them from being solved, then get to work alongside our community members to solve them.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Dear Brown Daily Herald,</p>
<p class="p2">Breakups are hard. They’re messy, and they hurt, and I understand that sometimes the only thing that can keep you going is spite. You take that anger and you turn it into fuel. There’s no better way to get back at someone who hurt you than by going forward and flaunting all of your successes in their face.</p>
<p class="p2">You’re allowed to take time to heal, and I don’t want to invalidate your feelings. But it’s been a full two years. You’re not going to like what I have to say, but I’ll say it nevertheless: It’s time to let Blog go.</p>
<p class="p2">Let’s back up and take a look at Brown’s institutional memory. In October 2015, the Brown Daily Herald published two <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/10/07/editors-note-32/">columns</a> that were, for lack of a better term, incredibly racist and particularly insulting to indigenous Americans. Understandably, a lot of people were upset by the lack of oversight that allowed these pieces to get published. There were protests, including a march in support of Indigenous People’s Day that went right by The Herald’s office. Brown then <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/03/fall-weekend-renamed-indigenous-peoples-day/">renamed</a> the holiday on Fall Weekend to Indigenous People’s Day. Eventually, criticism of the The Herald quieted down. But the emotional harm caused by the opinions pieces remained. You were not a popular publication that year (and quite frankly, you didn’t deserve to be). And although the pieces that caused the issue appeared in the paper proper, your other brands, post- and the BlogDailyHerald, were not unaffected due to their association with you.</p>
<p class="p2">On Feb. 9, 2016, a revolution occurred. Members of the BlogDailyHerald broke away and formed their own publication. The Blognonian <a href="http://blognonian.com/2016/02/09/senior-statement/">makes no secret</a> of the fact that it emerged from dissatisfied writers who felt that remaining with the BlogDailyHerald made it impossible for them to fully represent the student body across the spectrums of race, gender and class. Even today, the first sentence in their website’s “<a href="http://blognonian.com/about/">About Us</a>” reads “The Blognonian is an independent student publication brought to you by the former staff of BlogDailyHerald.” Each year that sentence becomes less and less true, as those who once wrote for the BlogDailyHerald graduate and underclassmen who have no understanding of the schism take their place. Yet still it remains, a testament to its origins.</p>
<p class="p2">BlogDailyHerald kept chugging along despite the break. A cursory search of the website suggests that no one ever acknowledged the split. Except … it’s not chugging anymore. It’s sad. And it’s time to make your breakup complete by letting go of the artifacts to which you cling.</p>
<p class="p2">You haven’t posted any original content to your Facebook page since November. The last apparent update on your website is from Jan. 26, an analysis of “Ratty vs. V-Dub.” Even a statement as timeless as “Chicken Finger Friday for lyfe” can’t make up for the fact that it’s a month into the semester and there’s just been nothing. Blognonian has brought us Datamatch and student spotlights, and you stay frozen.</p>
<p class="p2">And if I’m being honest, there are other issues too. Your website offers a variety of headers to direct readers to categories like “Sports” and “Relationships.” But the only one with any content is “Arts &amp; Culture.” Apparently in all of your existence, you’ve never covered “Campus Life.” Or you have, but your website hasn’t been maintained.</p>
<p class="p2">And then there’s your mascot. I don’t mean to be rude. Artistically, it’s well done. But it’s frightening. That bear’s sneer haunts me. I don’t feel that it’s about to inform me about campus goings-on in a friendly and upbeat way. I feel that I’m about to get mauled. In contrast, the Blognonian’s sun, with slightly glazed eyes and a lazy smile that make it look like the sort of thing that would unironically use the word “groovy,” feels much more reflective of the Brown community.</p>
<p class="p2">But more than anything, you can’t run from history. Blog’s continued existence is a reminder of an era when The Herald was practicing journalism irresponsibly. The refusal to acknowledge the writers who broke off to form a new platform that “better reflects (their) values” casts a pall over the content that The Herald comes up with. Maybe in a few years, students won’t know about any of this, but in the meantime, it’s hard to conceptualize BlogDailyHerald as anything but a h<span class="s1">oldover from a time when you did a poor job of owning up to your mistakes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And, finally, let’s face it — Brown isn’t that big. Maybe we can accommodate a dozen different a cappella groups that all perform slightly different pieces. But can, or should, we have two blogs that both aim to capture student life in the exact same way? Isn’t there something to be said for unity, for admitting that the campus might be better off if we could get our funny, #relatable news from a single source? The sheer number of student publications at Brown can be overwhelming. Is there really a need to keep a redundant platform on life support?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dear Brown Daily Herald, I wouldn’t be writing for you if I thought you were an irredeemable paper. But the events of two years ago are still remembered by roughly half the people on campus. There’s no shame in admitting that you had a good run, but it’s finished now. Especially if the alternative is letting Blog slowly decay, with no updates or improvements. Give it a good end, and be done with it.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Perhaps the only phenomenon that rivals the prevalence of dating apps on campus is the amount of energy we spend discussing them. A familiar scenario: At Ratty dinner, the “ping” of a new match breaches your roommate’s black iPhone display, and suddenly everyone is debating the virtues of messaging first on Tinder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or maybe: Your dad emails you this viral <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/opinion/you-up-college-in-the-age-of-tinder.html">New York Times piece</a>, with the subject line “is this what you’re doing now?!” Suffice it to say, whether or not we use dating apps ourselves, we’re all becoming experts in the mentality of quick, detached swipes.</p>
<p class="p3">College may be the time to experiment and figure out who we are, but it won’t be for long if we approach real-time decisions with the same logic we use on Tinder. I will not be contributing to the endless back-and-forth that is the digital dating debate, as I am neither qualified nor patient enough to conjure up my own opinion of the Bumble sphere. Rather, there is a specific element embedded in the fad that is worth writing about: the impact of these limitless choices on our daily decision-making. The mindset with which we swipe in a controlled and instant world — distracted and rushed — should not be the same one we apply in our everyday real lives.</p>
<p class="p3">In their article “The Tinderization of Feeling,” <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/tinderization-of-feeling/">Alicia Eler and Eve Peyser point out</a> how Tinder represents the “speeding up and mechanizing (of) decision-making, turning us into binary creatures who can bypass underlying questions and emotions and instead go with whatever feels really good in the moment.” Both the disconnect from our emotions and the instant gratification we derive from these choices warrant concern.</p>
<p class="p3">When we log onto dating apps, we process un<span class="s1">countable quantities of dog-holding, shirt-lacking men with the hope that the more we do, the higher chances we have of swiping upon the perfect one for us. Meanwhile, we are able to ignore the effects of our decisions in more ways than one: Not only are we distracted as we swipe and tap (by other apps, by our walk to class, by the real-life boy sitting next to us in the Blue Room), but we also are spared any response besides the positive, definitive, “You’ve got a match!” In this world, all choices can be framed solely in terms of immediate success or soon-to-be dismissed failure, rather than accounting for the myriad possibilities in between. </span></p>
<p class="p3">The problem is that this seemingly endless stream of digital choices leaves us feeling a sense of control and instant gratification that does not exist in the real world the way it does in the world created by our devices. Thus, we may find ourselves disappointed when we try to assume the expectations of Tinder-swiping in our everyday lives. There is no wonder why I consider dropping a class when I am not immediately captivated by the thrilling recital of the course syllabus when I am so used to instant gratification. (I’m not alone in sometimes losing interest fairly quickly: The average human attention span is now just eight seconds, according to a <a href="http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/">2015 Microsoft study</a> that blamed our constant mobile multitasking for the drop.)</p>
<p class="p3">Rather than instill us with confidence in our ability to make choices, the all-or-nothing attitude and instant gratification that we begin to live by actually leave us more averse to taking risks in all aspects of our lives. When we become too accustomed to quick choices that bring near-instant gain, we start to lose perspective of the benefits of unexpected and delayed rewards. As an English major, my decision to take a statistics class was not founded in the belief that the only thing standing in the way of me and my true academic passion was understanding the mechanisms of a t-test. Rather, the choice came from the desire to try something new and the hope — though not the certainty — that maybe its worth would be revealed to me in a future undertaking.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The solution is not to exclude the mechanisms that allow these choices from our lives, as they have indisputably made certain things easier. However, we need to consciously decide to make other, real-time decisions grounded in the principles of risk and delayed gratification. If our choices define us, what does it mean if we get too used to turning to the quick and easy decision, one solely focused on instant gain? We need to practice our ability to make emotionally nuanced, thoughtful decisions if we want to see ourselves in the choices we make. </span></p>

		<title>Miller &#039;19: I, not a robot, wrote this article</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Computer science has impacted almost every aspect of our world, linking individual minds in a searchable format. Every field has responded to, and many have benefited from, the innovations brought by the computer and its increasing capabilities. Journalism has been no exception. Artificial intelligence has made it possible for reporters to access hugely complex visualizations of data, instantly connecting them to stories worthy of further investigation and broadening and balancing their views. With even further implications, natural language processing and generating has enabled bots to create news articles that are nearly indistinguishable from those that human journalists would write. Journalism and computer science are now intertwined, with overarching consequences for the field of journalism and its employees.</span></p>
<p class="p4">While workers in many sectors of the economy have already seen or fear the prospect of job displacement through automation, I do not think journalists will meet the same fate anytime soon. And while computers can never fully assume the journalist’s work of reporting and conducting interviews, I welcome the contributions that AI and NLP can bring to the field, aiding journalists in making new connections and assembling stories.</p>
<p class="p4">Following the technological revolution of the past few decades, journalists have had to respond to myriad changes and innovations. But few ever thought that a computer using NLP would be capable of writing articles for them and taking their jobs from them. And the manner in which the computers can do this is fascinating. The NLP system first uses content selection to find the information. Next, it organizes that information, makes a structure of the text and finds the correct words to discuss the information. Lastly, the system adds in “emotion” and proper grammar to emulate a <a href="http://compute-cuj.org/cj-2014/cj2014_session4_paper2.pdf">human-generated article</a>. (All emotion written in this article came from the heart.)</p>
<p class="p4">While this technology has been around since the birth of the computer, NLP systems have become more accurate and efficient <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/opinion/sunday/if-an-algorithm-wrote-this-how-would-you-even-know.html">wordsmiths</a>: “Things looked bleak for the Angels when they trailed by two runs in the ninth inning, but Los Angeles recovered thanks to a key single from Vladimir Guerrero to pull out a 7-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park on Sunday.” It is hard to believe that a computer generated this sentence, but few people can even tell the difference between a computer-generated version and a human-written article, as a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2014.883116">study</a> in Sweden demonstrated. I promise I wrote this article you are now reading, but would you even know if I hadn’t?</p>
<p class="p4">Newspapers have started to discuss the legitimacy of allowing computers to become their chosen authors, and many have decided at most to allow computers to handle data and other tedious tasks, such as summarizing, and allowing reporters to focus on assignments befitting of their qualifications. However, others have <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2014.883116">estimated</a> that “90 percent of news could be algorithmically generated by the mid-2020’s.”</p>
<p class="p4">AI systems have aided journalists in finding new stories by categorizing masses of data into data visualizations. In other cases, the computer has fully taken over the job of the reporter and NLP has enabled it to generate articles fit for print. In both, the computer has provided a tool to safeguard accuracy and identify meaningful results, while providing writers additional time for creative expression. It is a developing partnership which, while young, has already begun to bear a bounty of journalistic fruit.</p>
<p class="p4">However, this partnership ends at a certain point. While the computer can amass an enormous data visualization set, the AI system can only go so far, and the inferences on which story to tell from the data can be discovered by the journalists themselves. Meredith Broussard, a professor of data journalism at Temple University, describes what the computer can and can’t do: “Using the vast ‘computational’ resources of the human brain, the reporter takes only moments to look at the data revealed by the system, leverage formal and informal knowledge and make a judgment about the likelihood of a story. It would require vast amounts of computing power to get the computer to draw the same conclusions; <a href="http://compute-cuj.org/cj-2014/cj2014_session1_paper1.pdf">it could take years</a> to tease out all of the subtleties of human news judgment and implement them computationally.” Even this “expert system” has its limitations. She adds, “The human brain thus becomes an efficient and complementary part of the story-generating process, aided and augmented by the computational system.”</p>
<p class="p4">Only with time will we see how the balance plays out between NLP systems and journalists, not to mention whether our egos will allow proper attribution in the by-line. I believe that computer systems and journalists will forge a synergistic relationship producing the best quality of journalism with new possibilities for data visualization. In the meantime, lucky for me, I will live to see another day as a columnist.</p>

		<title>Flynn &#039;20: What would John Stuart Mill say?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">When speaking on Feb. 13 at Brown, conservative journalist and author Guy Benson faced pushback from students who expressed disappointment with the decision to invite him to speak on campus. In a public statement, <a href="http://bluestockingsmag.com/2018/02/13/silencing-and-free-speech/">a collective of students opposed the event</a>, arguing that Benson’s message was not merely misguided but actually dangerous to the community. This<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>concern — that certain ideas and beliefs are so pernicious that they could cause real and irreparable harm to communities — prevails on campuses throughout the country and seems to be on everyone’s mind.</p>
<p class="p3">But it is important to remember that concerns about specific varieties of speech, though pressing, are not at all new, and that the approaches writers have taken in the past can help us address them. In the 19th century, British utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill responded to arguments made by the religious establishment and proponents of censorship. It goes without saying that modern debates over free speech on campuses differ in nearly every way from those of Mill’s time. But Mill — one of the foremost political philosophers of Western history — makes unique contributions to modern debates over free speech, providing rigorous, intellectual justifications for the concept of free speech and its role in maintaining social welfare. Mill’s defense of the freedom of expression <a href="https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/mill/liberty.pdf">consists of two hypotheses</a> as to why free speech is beneficial not just to the speaker but to society as a whole — including those who disagree with the speaker. He argues against censorship because first, “we can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is … false” and second, “if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A central point of Mill’s philosophy is that everyone is fallible, and therefore all opinions, even those held by the majority or the authorities, are suspect. Throughout history, people have held ideas with absolute certainty only to be scorned by later generations that come to reject them. Given our fallibility, the only way to be sure that we are right is the constant re-evaluation of our ideas. As Mill writes, “the beliefs which we have most warrant for have no safeguard to rest on, but a standing invitation to the whole world to prove them unfounded.” Mill assumes that one’s “errors are corrigible,” but that the only way of correcting them is discussion. Ideas, moreover, are rarely black-and-white, and two seemingly dichotomous views often each contain a portion of the truth. Far from being a mere abstraction, this concept is more than evident in the case of Benson. The day after his talk, Caroline Mulligan ’19 published <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/14/mulligan-19-theres-identity-politics/">a column</a> in which she expressed agreement with Benson’s argument that a personal identity does not have to determine political views. With the disclaimer that she “does not, for the record, agree with Benson about anything else at all,” she illustrated that one can learn from people with whom one disagrees, and that a nuanced understanding of an adversary’s views can enhance one’s own understanding of complicated issues. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The next useful part of Mill’s free speech argument is that “received opinion” ­— a unanimous opinion that goes unchallenged — runs the risk of degrading into dogma, even if it were true with absolute certainty. That is, one does not fully understand one’s own position if one does not fully understand the arguments against it. The right response, therefore, to those who challenge a received opinion is to say, as Mill puts it, “let us thank them for it, open our minds to listen to them, and rejoice that there is some one to do for us what we otherwise ought, if we have any regard for either the certainty or the vitality of our convictions.” In this view, conservative speakers such as Benson are doing us a favor by challenging the received opinions of our campus. They strengthen our values by helping us define ours against theirs. Benson’s event featured a question-and-answer section, in which even students who had signed the statement participated, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/brown-stares-down-the-censors-1518652424">according to a Wall Street Journal editorial</a>. Those students criticized him, arguing that he did not take into account historical power dynamics and systems of oppression. Such discussions compel students to articulate and think critically about their views, thereby strengthening them. </span></p>
<p class="p3">The primary problem with Mill is that he does not recognize the exceptions to free speech. He does forbid speech that serves as a “positive instigation to some mischievous act,” but by this he means nothing more than inciting an unruly mob to immediate violence. The U.S. legal system, of course, recognizes more exceptions, such as hate speech and certain types of false statements of fact. But the statement opposing Benson accuses him of espousing “hateful rhetoric which actively makes others less safe,” and asserts the “inextricable connection between Benson’s ideologies — fiscal conservatism and free market ideology — and real, tangible, state violence against marginalized communities.” It is of utmost importance to be cognizant of the ways in which a speaker’s words can have an adverse impact on members of the community. That being said, Benson’s talk does not seem to have had any such impact. To the contrary, it provided the very students who objected to it an opportunity to engage with an opposing viewpoint in a way that Mill would have considered productive.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The idea of masculinity has been on my mind for some time now. I was first introduced to the concept in an English class my junior year of high school. Fast forward a few years: I now find myself serving as a student co-coordinator of the Masculinity Peer Education program here at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/health/services/promotion/masculinity-101-peer-education">Brown</a>. Our program introduces various organizations on campus to discussions about masculinity and helps to create a healthier environment in group spaces.

My work with masculinity and peer education has profoundly informed how I’ve understood the recent mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, in which a 19-year-old man killed 17 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/us/florida-shooting-victims-school/index.html">people</a>. Following the shooting, there have been various articles — printed in publications from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/opinion/boys-violence-shootings-guns.html ; https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/02/male-violence-is-everywhere/554261">New York Times</a> to <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a18207600/mass-shootings-male-entitlement-toxic-masculinity/">Harper’s Bazaar</a> — that link the shooting to the broken state of the American man. These pieces examine how harmful the unrealistic expectations of conventional masculinity can be to men and the world at large, and how these expectations can lead some men down dangerous, violent paths. In light of the Parkland shooting and broader conversations about assault and equality, it is now the time to recognize the crisis of masculinity afflicting our country and the need for a comprehensive redefinition of manhood: a men’s revolution.

Such a revolution would prove beneficial to everyone, not just men. Upon hearing the phrase “toxic masculinity,” one might first think about how it impacts other people. What can often be overlooked, though, is that men suffer greatly from toxic masculinity, too. Thanks to toxic masculinity, men are encouraged to constantly meet a range of unrealistic expectations: to exaggerate dominant traits, embody stoicism through extreme emotional suppression and never show any signs of weakness. For example, men are much less likely to seek help for mental health issues and much more likely to suffer in silence than their <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/talking-about-men/201702/mens-mental-health-silent-crisis">female counterparts</a>. Redefining what it means to be a man is a possible remedy to both these external and internal problems. A man not seeking to fulfill a harmful expectation is less likely to perpetrate harm against another individual and himself. Additionally, the redefinition of manhood will help men figure out our role in the 21st century. How can we productively participate in our communities if we’re still holding on to archaic, harmful notions of what it means to be a man? The narrow boxes in which men have to fit right now do a disservice to everyone. A large-scale change of the expectations applied to men is necessary if we ever wish to see the liberation of all people — regardless of gender.

Obviously, to champion the need for a men’s revolution and not provide any idea of what it might look like isn’t helpful. But a men’s revolution may be easier to catalyze than we might think. With respect to young people, we might look at how youth sports teach boys harmful ways to act and interact. Coaches should emphasize the difference between competition or athleticism and hypermasculinity. One need not be toxically masculine — overaggressive and dismissive of other people’s feelings — in order to be a great athlete. Further, the school system ought to support counseling in schools and encourage male students to seek help. Letting boys know from a young age that asking for help is a normal, human thing — rather than something outside of the “masculine” norm — would aid in this effort.

On college campuses, the revolution might see more schools creating programs similar to the Masculinity Peer Education program I’m involved with now. Such programs would continue the education around masculinity that will have already started at a young age. This reinforcement of a more flexible approach to masculinity will pay dividends for men and society as a whole. We can use sexual assault as an example. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, 23.1 percent of female college students and 5.4 percent of male college students “experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/campus-sexual-violence">incapacitation.”</a> By openly exploring masculinity and the ways in which we are socialized to adhere to toxic expectations, men will be able to understand the role they play in sexual assault on college campuses and work to change that role, while also working to embolden male survivors of sexual assault to share their experiences. Once they graduate, young men will be able to apply the knowledge they’ve internalized and make full use of it in their everyday lives. In the workplace, workshops specifically centered on masculinity that clearly lay out appropriate boundaries of behavior and human resources policies might also prove beneficial.

My vision for such a revolution is certainly not comprehensive, and will require lots of time and the active participation of people of all genders and backgrounds. And it’s possible such a revolution has already begun: Adam Rippon, one of the first openly gay athletes to compete for Team USA at the Olympics, just won a bronze medal while actively rejecting the narrow, predefined stereotype of a “real man” as a large, lumbering and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/rippon-rewarded-silver-medal-long-journey-olympic-stage/story?id=53074648">aggressive athlete.</a>  In the age of the #MeToo movement and Women’s Marches, it’s time for men to have a parallel revolution — one that will liberate not only men, but all of society, from the constraints of toxic masculinity.

		<title>Savello &#039;18: Thesis writing — passion or pressure?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">The summer before my senior year, I swore to myself I wouldn’t write a senior thesis. I wanted to spend my final year at Brown making the most of my classes and activities — not stressing over a random 40+ page research paper I had no interest in writing. When I returned to campus in the fall semester, however, all my friends could talk about were their thesis abstracts and research progress and upcoming deadlines. It seemed like no matter whom I spoke with, nearly every senior I knew was doing a thesis. Naturally, I started to feel left out and began to wonder if I was making a mistake…</p>
<p class="p3">A few weeks into school, someone asked me why I wasn’t doing a thesis of my own. “Well, I’m a Hispanic Studies concentrator. It would have to be 50 pages in a foreign language,” I explained, trying to defend myself. It was true. Both the length and language requirement were big deterrents for me, among others like the tight deadlines and excessive reading. In response, they asked me why I couldn’t just have my advisor edit my grammatical mistakes. “It can’t be that hard, right?” they asked.</p>
<p class="p3">I hate to admit it, but I let this condescending comment get to me. The very next day, two weeks before the thesis abstract deadline, I ran to my departmental advisor, panicking and asking if it wasn’t too late. Believe it or not, I had actually been guilt-tripped into writing a senior thesis. This is problematic and far too common: Even at a school that claims to promote unique and personal academic paths, too many of us end up conforming, undertaking the biggest project of our college careers for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p class="p3">I’m sure that there are many students who choose to write them out of pure passion and interest. But when it comes to senior theses, this prioritization of reputation (or even competition) over interest is not atypical. Among highly motivated and overachieving Ivy League students, it’s inevitable that there are going to be people writing a thesis solely for its value on a transcript or the “honors” status on a diploma. As a result, it’s almost certain that there will be peer pressure to write one. In fact, as I’ve experienced first-hand, there seems to be an academic and social stigma surrounding seniors who choose not to write a thesis or do some sort of research-related equivalent.</p>
<p class="p3">But what I’ve learned about thesis writing through my experience is that it has nothing to do with reputation or ability. Every Brown student is perfectly capable of doing a thesis, but that doesn’t mean they have to do one. In fact, in order to get the most out of a thesis and complete it to the best of your ability, the most important thing is not how smart you are — it’s how passionate you are about the specific topic of your thesis.</p>
<p class="p3">I was lucky: Despite my initial misplaced motivations, I ended up<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— in the last waking moment before the abstract deadline hit — stumbling across a topic that fascinated me. Had I not, I doubt the hours of researching, writing and revising would have been worthwhile. The bulk of the work may be reading articles and writing an analytical paper, but passion and interest are what make the final product so rewarding. Without passion, thesis writing becomes an unbearable chore that takes away from the valuable last months of college with only a superficial benefit. As my research comes to an end, I can proudly say that I have gotten so much more out of the experience than just the word “honors” written on my diploma. I’ve uncovered important parts of my family history and learned how to connect themes from a variety of my department’s classes, both of which have enriched and culminated my Brown experience.</p>
<p class="p3">Ultimately, I started my thesis for the wrong reasons, and ended up discovering a true motivation and passion for my work. But I don’t recommend taking this route. Before setting out to write a thesis, genuinely consider the reasons why you’re doing it and if you actually care about the topic at hand. A thesis can be of great value to students when they are driven by interest and curiosity, but if they are writing one solely to gain recognition or prove themselves, it is simply a stressful and meaningless research project. If you truly don’t have a topic that enthralls you, don’t feel pressured to write a thesis. There are other satisfying ways to cap off your time at Brown, like picking up an extra class that captivates you or completing an alternative capstone project. By the time we reach senior year, we have had three full years to craft our academic paths and identities. Drawing upon this experience, we should work to be confident enough in our identities as students to make the best choice without succumbing to outside influence.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the wake of the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, gun control has once again been pushed to the forefront of public discourse. While there was considerable public outrage in the days immediately following the massacre, one could not be blamed for taking a cynical outlook on the status of gun control in this country. If we failed to catalyze lasting momentum for gun reform after Sandy Hook, Las Vegas or countless other mass shootings, why would this prove any different?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">However, persistent activism, especially from students who survived the harrowing experience, has subverted this cynical view. By <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/02/17/no-more-guns-florida-students-and-residents-rally-to-denounce-political-inaction-after-17-killed-in-school-shooting/?utm_term=.de7d0a0ce07c">continuously ​holding protests</a>​, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/22/politics/cnn-town-hall-full-video-transcript/index.html">​speaking on national television​</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/opinion/florida-school-shooting-guns.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=2FC117A40CFD3843013F674A74AF05DE&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=opinion">publishing op-eds</a>, they have ensured the cultural resonance of this debate — a seemingly impossible task in the Trump era. Even the president, speaking on live television last Wednesday, urged Congress to resurrect gun reform legislation from the Obama era. Naturally, this elicited considerable opposition from GOP lawmakers, and given President Trump’s erraticism (he also promised a DACA deal), significant gun reform from either house of Congress in the GOP-controlled legislative branch seems unlikely. Instead, it has been in state legislatures where the most ambitious gun reform bills have been proposed and where immediate action has been taken. This recent swell in state-level gun control legislation reflects the importance of local political action given the context of federal inaction. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Rhode Island has been especially active in enacting gun control following the Parkland shooting. On Feb. 22, the state joined a coalition with New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Connecticut; these states have pledged to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/nyregion/four-northeast-states-pledge-to-share-gun-safety-data.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=8A64290C7E1C88DF9B810847566EBBA6&amp;gwt=pay">share registries</a> of individuals prohibited from owning firearms within their borders. The coalition also plans to share data regarding the sale of firearms and gun trafficking within the Northeast corridor in hopes of lowering the number of weapons left circulating in an illicit secondary market. And while these five states are historically Democratic strongholds, the inclusion of Massachusetts, and Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, ensures the coalition was not formed solely along party lines.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Moreover, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo has wielded executive power to pass immediate measures to curb gun violence; she signed an executive order Feb. 26, modeled after existing “red-flag” laws, which empower judges to seize guns from individuals who show warning signs of violence. While this law alone would have tangible benefits — <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rhode-island-red-flag-law-florida-shooting-gun-control-gina-raimondo-a8229826.html">a 2016 Duke University study</a> found that red-flag laws in Connecticut ​reduced statewide suicides​ — Raimondo hopes that her executive order will presage more sweeping and durable gun reform laws. “The executive order is an immediate step we can take,” Raimondo said last Monday. “It sets the table for a complementary legislative effort.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The “complementary legislative effort” Raimondo spoke of is less abstract than it seems; there is already <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/27/community-rallies-assault-weapons-ban/">a proposed bill</a> from Sen. Joshua Miller (D-Cranston) and Rep. Jason Knight (D-Barrington) to ban assault rifles within the state. Miller did not mince <a href="http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/pressrelease/_layouts/RIL.PressRelease.ListStructure/Forms/DisplayForm.aspx?List=c8baae31-3c10-431c-8dcd-9dbbe21ce3e9&amp;ID=13504">words</a> when asked about the importance of his legislation: “Assault weapons are meant to kill and maim as many people as possible, as quickly as possible — they are weapons for mass shooters, not recreational hunters.” Miller’s rhetoric may appear severe, but it remains accurate. Assault rifles — specifically AR-15s — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/28/us/ar-15-rifle-mass-shootings.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fus&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=us&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=39&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=5F12BA493E67990D8E6F4444C3CDD2AC&amp;gwt=pay">have been involved</a> in ​practically every recent mass shooting​; the grim list includes Sandy Hook, Las Vegas and Parkland.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Miller and Knight’s proposed assault rifle ban intersects with two significant aspects of the gun control debate. Firstly, it shows the changing attitudes towards military-grade rifles, the weapons of choice for mass shooters. Outlawing assault rifles would not be the salve that liberals dream of, and would almost certainly lead to increased sales of non-assault semi-automatic rifles, which can possess nearly identical lethality. But only debating the functional effects of this ban is myopic — the fact that state legislators feel compelled to act swiftly on gun control reflects the shifting public consensus on the subject. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Additionally, the proposed ban exemplifies the power of state legislatures to pass laws that oppose the espoused policy of the presidential administration. It is reminiscent of California Gov. Jerry Brown’s actions to combat climate change; in July 2017, Brown extended California’s cap-and-trade program, a thorough repudiation of Trump’s attitude toward global warming (just a month earlier, Trump had withdrawn the United States from the Paris Climate Accord). The leader of California’s state senate, Kevin de Leon, said in December 2016 that, “California will not deviate from our leadership because of one election.” De Leon’s rhetoric was echoed last week by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, when he outlined the importance of joining the aforementioned gun registry coalition: “This is a federal government that’s gone backwards on this issue … Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/nyregion/four-northeast-states-pledge-to-share-gun-safety-data.html?mtrref=www.google.com">has pledged allegiance</a> to the (National Rifle Association) and he’s delivered for them.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While liberal policies have little hope of being implemented at the federal level for the foreseeable future, state legislatures controlled by Democrats can enact policies that oppose the regressive measures proposed by the national government. Indeed, California’s actions toward climate change were echoed in liberal actions toward gun reform in the Northeast; it proves that inaction at the federal level does not preclude states from pursuing their own progressive policies. The actions taken in these states reflect the importance of Democratic campaign success beyond the national races; looking ahead to the 2018 midterms, Democratic activism should not be limited to Senate seats when gubernatorial races and state legislatures exist as possible bastions for the progressive agenda. If Democrats are serious about enacting gun reform, activism at the state level may be a more practical route — Rhode Island can act as an instructive example for other states.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, momentum has grown around the movement to “ban the box” — the checkbox that asks if one has a criminal conviction on initial job applications. Proponents of the ban argue th</span><span class="s2">at employers use the question to screen applicants unfairly, which disproportionately affects young men of color and amplifies the effects of a prejudiced <a href="http://www.nelp.org/publication/ban-the-box-fair-chance-hiring-state-and-local-guide/">criminal justice system</a>. Currently, 30 states ban this question for government jobs, and 10 states, including Rhode Island, have also prohibited private employers from asking the question on initial job applications. Meanwhile, a smaller but growing movement has focused on a similar question on college applications, which generally require even more information than job applications do. While employers typically limit their question to felony convictions, the Common Application, used by more than 700 colleges and universities including Brown, asks about felonies, misdemeanors and guilty <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/thinking-beyond-the-box-the-use-of-criminal-records-in-college-admissions">juvenile adjudications</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Banning the box” for both employment and college admissions is an important step in achieving racial justice, as this question amplifies the harm caused by a biased and flawed criminal justice system. The criminal justice system touches the lives of a large portion of America’s young people; 30 percent of Americans will have an arrest record by the age of 23. For young men of color, encounters with the criminal justice system are commonplace: By age 23, 44 percent of Hispanic men and 49 percent of black men will have<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/thinking-beyond-the-box-the-use-of-criminal-records-in-college-admissions/#footnote-12"> arrest records</a>. Furthermore, racial disparities in criminal justice are well-documented. For example, although black Americans and white Americans use drugs at similar rates, black Americans are nearly three times more likely to be arrested for drug-related crime, and more than six times more likely to be incarcerated for the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/twelve-facts-about-incarceration-and-prisoner-reentry/">same offense</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In addition, research shows that “the box” is a significant barrier for those with criminal records in admissions. One study found that rejection rates were 12 to 13 percent higher for those with criminal convictions compared to similar students without <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/twelve-facts-about-incarceration-and-prisoner-reentry/">convictions</a>. More importantly, evidence suggests that “the box” discourages a</span><span class="s1">pplicants with criminal convictions from applying at all. For example, of 3,000 potential applicants with felony convictions to the State University of New York system, 62 percent failed to complete the application, compared to 21 percent of potential applicants without <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/twelve-facts-about-incarceration-and-prisoner-reentry/">convictions</a>. Because higher education offers a clear path toward secure employment and <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm">higher wages</a>, excluding those with criminal histories from this path amplifies the damage caused by an unfair criminal justice system and makes breaking free from such a system much harder. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Colleges and universities are rightly concerned about the safety of their students, which may make them hesitant to “ban the box” on college applications. Yet college students who commit crimes rarely have a prior record, and there is little evidence to suggest that college students with criminal convictions are more likely to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/thinking-beyond-the-box-the-use-of-criminal-records-in-college-admissions">commit crimes</a>. In fact, most crimes on </span><span class="s2">college campuses are related to “binge drinking, Greek life and big-time college athletics,” according to the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/ban-the-box-comes-to-campus/480195/">Atlantic</a>. While asking about specific aspects of an applicant’s criminal history — such as convictions related to sexual assault — could possibly help colleges protect students, the broad nature of the Common Application criminal history question does more harm than good.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the past few years, some colleges and universities have made efforts to balance commitments to justice and student safety. In 2016, in response to activism by the SUNY Student Assembly, the SUNY Board of Trustees voted to stop asking applicants about prior convictions, although they still require this information on applications for <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/15/suny-removes-question-criminal-convictions-application">on-campus housing, study abroad and other programs</a>. In 2017, Louisiana became the first state to ban all public colleges from asking about crim</span><span class="s2">inal history except for sexual assault or stalking. Unfortunately, similar legislation was <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/06/19/louisiana-becomes-first-state-ban-box">recently vetoed</a> in Maryland.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So far, private colleges and universities have been slower to adjust. One notable exception is New York University, which revised its admissions policy in 2015 in response to persistent student activism by the Incarceration to Education Coalition. Currently, while the undergraduate college still uses the Common Application and asks for applicants’ conviction history, the admissions team conducts initial application reviews without knowledge of prior convictions and then considers conviction hi</span><span class="s2">story later in the process. NYU’s Silver School of Social Work has abandoned the question <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/may/nyu-revises-admissions-practices-for-applicants-convicted-of-a-crime.html">altogether</a>. In 2016, responding to continued pressure from the <a href="https://www.nyunews.com/2016/03/28/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-iec-sit-in/">IEC</a>, NYU sent a <a href="https://www.nyunews.com/2016/02/01/nyu-calls-out-common-app-on-criminal-convictions-checkbox/">letter</a> to the Common Application “advising the organization to evaluate the value of disciplinary and criminal history checkboxes in their application.” While the IEC urged the administration to go further, calling the letter a<a href="https://www.nyunews.com/2016/03/28/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-iec-sit-in/"> “stalling tactic,”</a> the administration has not yet taken any further action.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">These recent developments show that “banning the box” is not straightforward in practice. Yet while colleges and universities should absolutely make every effort to protect their students, the current form and use of the criminal convictions question is far too broad and thus contributes to racial injustice without any clear benefits to student safety. Up until now, student activism has been incredibly effective in putting “ban the box” on the higher education agenda and convincing college administrations to make some much-needed reforms. It’s time for Brown </span><span class="s1">— if we truly value justice and equity — to follow these student activists’ lead and start a conversation about how to create policies that keep students safe without perpetuating racial injustice in college admissions.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Brown recently announced plans to build a “wellness dorm,” <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/25/university-seeks-approval-construct-new-wellness-dorm/">The Herald previously reported</a>. No one has yet elaborated on what this means: whether the dorm will be focused on physical health, mental health, general healthy living habits or some combination thereof. In any case, this project demonstrates a commitment to consciously constructing housing that prioritizes students’ needs and wellbeing.</p>
<p class="p3">The wellness dorm is a promising first step, but Brown should go further in improving the quality of housing that it offers. Prioritizing accessible and appealing residential halls will benefit the health of both students and the community at large.</p>
<p class="p3">It’s not easy to write in support of better dorms; one always runs the risk of sounding entitled, as though student housing should be on the same scale as luxury hotels. Let me be clear: I’m not requesting that Brown give us all <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/opinion/trustees-tuition-lazy-rivers.html">a lazy river</a>. I’m not asking for a <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article196135589.html">movie theatre</a>. These are wastes of money that could be better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p3">What I am asking for is housing that students actually want to live in. Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/22/savello-18-reslife-fails-upperclassmen/">Samantha Savello ’18 detailed</a> how the Office of Residential Life seems to put little effort into making desirable housing options for upperclassmen. Savello describes entering a Graduate Center dorm and finding rat poison, peeling plaster and holes in the walls.</p>
<p class="p3">My experiences have been similar. In my Hegeman room, I’ve had several opportunities to play my favorite guessing game: Did I drop some of the dried coconut that I was snacking on, or is the paint just falling off my walls again? (It’s difficult to get a correct answer; the best practice is to just be safe and not put it in your mouth either way). The halls are even worse. On my floor alone, I counted three spots where paint just hung off the walls. And while I won’t complain about the occasional cockroach in the bathroom (I recognize them as an inevitable problem when you’ve got so many people crowded under one roof), the basement — home to the washers and dryers, trash room and the sole kitchenette that serves the 100-plus residents living in Hegeman — is a bit of a mess. It’s so hot that there’s no way to comfortably cook a meal down there. Not to mention the fetid smell created by storing trash in the steamiest part of the building, which makes the one lounge in Hegeman extremely uninviting.</p>
<p class="p3">These conditions aren’t exactly conducive to wellness. As <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/09/living-space-aesthetics-impact-students-mental-health/">a Herald article</a> by Emily Miller ’19 points out, decorating dorm rooms can help students create environments that offer a comfortable and relaxed escape from the academic pressures of Brown. But decor can only do so much against the general dilapidation of Brown’s upperclassmen dorms. I can attest to the fact that it’s hard to be happy when you have to sweep up chipped paint from your floor.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But even these aesthetic concerns aren’t the biggest downside to many of Brown’s dorms. Many of these living spaces are physically inaccessible to students with disabilities. On the second floor of the Hegeman tower where I live, the bathroom has both a toilet stall and a shower stall designed to accommodate a person in a wheelchair. Unfortunately, there’s no elevator. So if you can make it up the stairs, you’re rewarded with an accessible bathroom, but if not? Well … tough luck. I encountered a similar situation last year in New Pembroke. Sure, there are some residential halls that students with mobility difficulties can navigate with relative ease. They just might not be able to visit their friends’ rooms. Or, if you have a parent with a physical disability, they might not be able to help you move in or even see your room at all. Again, tough luck.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Making simple changes, like increasing accessibility or brightening up decaying paint jobs, could ultimately encourage students to stay on campus as upperclassmen. And if more students are encouraged to stay on campus, that could ultimately slow down gentrification, benefiting the health of the greater Providence community. In <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/08/local-advocacy-group-pushes-rent-control/">a Herald recent article</a> about efforts to control rental prices, advocates pointed to a family whose home was sold to Providence Student Living, a group that provides students with housing at higher rent prices than what the family paid. Although I can’t say if that house, which is in the Federal Hill area, will be targeted toward Brown students, Providence Student Living owns student housing all over Providence. It’s not hard to imagine families closer to campus being evicted for the sake of renting out overpriced student apartments.</span></p>
<p class="p3">While the wellness dorm is a good step, there are many other improvements that ResLife could make to existing dorms in order to prioritize the physical and mental health of the students that live in them. No college student needs a luxury dorm, but asking for a space free of holes in the wall or falling chunks of plaster is not an unreasonable demand.</p>

		<title>Johnson &#039;20: We need a more diverse CS faculty</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In late February, the computer science department announced that Seny Kamara will be promoted to Associate Professor with tenure as of July 1, 2018. This is an amazing achievement, especially for Kamara, since there is currently only one other professor in the computer science department who is from an underrepresented minority group, a term used for the purposes of this piece on diversity in computer science to refer to black people, Latinos and Native Americans. As of 2015, black people “represent only 1.7 percent of tenured and non-tenured faculty in computer science and related departments” in the United States, according to a Computing Research Association report. This underrepresentation of minorities in computer science faculty can impact the experience of minorities currently pursuing that degree. An increase in minority representation among faculty members in the computer science department can improve the engagement of underrepresented minority students in the field, and Brown should work toward this goal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">For one, research has shown that black students are more likely to succeed in a STEM major if they are taught by a black professor. Furthermore, for every additional course taught by a black professor, the likelihood that a black student persists in a STEM field increases. A possible reason for this could be that it can be affirming to minority students when they see someone who is also an underrepresented minority in a leadership role. Some may say that minority students can still succeed when being taught by a white professor in these STEM fields, which is true. However, underrepresented minority professors can motivate underrepresented minority students to thrive in their course and related field, since these professors faced significant challenges in order to be successful and obtain a high-ranking role, providing a model to which their students can aspire. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In addition, increasing minority representation in faculty can strengthen mentorships for minority students. The faculty in the computer science department help guide students to complete their degrees. A good academic advisor not only needs to be knowledgeable and helpful, but they also should be aware of the academic challenges students can face, including the role that negative stereotypes can play in student achievement. The underrepresentation of minorities in the faculty can impose an additional barrier for underrepresented minority students to potentially building close mentor relationships with their professors. “Prior research has shown that same-race (and same-gender) mentorship can provide more psychological support than cross-race (and cross-gender) relationships,” according to aforementioned report. Underrepresented minority professors can relate more to minority students since these professors have been in their shoes before. They have faced the same academic stresses and challenges that minorities face on a daily basis in the computer science field, and therefore they can provide advice to help guide students though these challenges in order to succeed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">With an increase in minority representation within the faculty of the computer science department, underrepresented minorities can be further motivated to pursue the field. As there is still underrepresentation of minorities within the faculty, students and faculty can provoke action in order to have an environment that welcomes different perspectives. Minority professors in the sciences note that they are more motivated to pursue a job at a university with a strong minority presence in their departments. In order to motivate potential new hires to join the computer science department, the current faculty could hire more than one minority faculty member at a time in order to create an inclusive community and decrease isolation for these professors. The University could also recruit from minority-serving institutions like historically black colleges and universities and offer special summer sessions and mentoring groups in order to attract minority professors to Brown. If these two options aren’t feasible, our university can consult minority-serving institutions that already have a diverse faculty and learn more alternative options for how they can recruit a similarly diverse faculty. Students can talk to a member of the computer science department’s Student Advocates for Diversity and Inclusion about bringing awareness to the lack of diversity within the department and about how to create a more inclusive community.</span></p>

		<title>Samilow &#039;19: Academic boycotts are bad for the academy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A Supreme Court justice once said, in the context of the death penalty, that when a judge feels unable to apply a law because of his or her personal views, it’s time to resign and either launch a political campaign or lead a revolution. We might venture similar career advice for academics, many of whom, like federal judges, enjoy the remarkable luxury of life tenure, and are constrained in what they do and say largely by their own sense of propriety. In much the same way that judges must be careful to distinguish between what the law is and what they think it ought to be, academics have to keep on the right side of the often blurry line between teaching and political advocacy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sometimes the line isn’t all that blurry though.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last Thursday, Brown’s Middle East Studies program held a “critical conversation” on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This one was called “Permission to Speak: Boycott and the Politics of Solidarity,” and promoted a newly-published collection of essays supporting the boycott of Israeli universities — among other institutions — to protest injustices against Palestinians. (The book in question was actually being sold outside the event.) Perhaps I’m jaded, but it seems pointless to waste perfectly good column space debating whether Israel is diabolical enough to be boycotted. Rather than further swell that already abundant genre, instead I want to simply point out why — no matter one’s views on Israel — academic boycotts are, by their nature, a form of political activism that invariably corrupts education.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What makes academic boycotts so pernicious is that they establish one standard of pedagogy for teaching Israel, and another standard of pedagogy for teaching all other countries. Israel is, along with Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey, one of the Middle East’s four most politically influential countries. It is the region’s only non-Muslim state. It wields emotional and symbolic influence wildly disproportionate to its actual power — or perhaps it actually wields such disproportionate power because of its emotional and symbolic influence. It is simply impossible to properly instruct students on the history and politics of the Middle East while out-of-hand ignoring a major actor’s academic institutions. Universities are crucial to the development of a nation’s moral ethos and political strategy, often incubating ideas before they take root in media, government and laws. If these institutions are made into lepers, how are students supposed to learn about Israel in the same way they learn about Egypt or Iran or Saudi Arabia?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those who would join the boycott indulge in a rather dangerous solipsism, where the task of education is sacrificed for the moral gratification of this or that educator. This is not to say professors cannot have opinions, even ones that color their teaching. There’s a difference between presenting a perhaps slanted take on a particular topic and treating that topic as if it is not even worth the courtesy of equal analysis. No matter how valid institutionalized support for academic boycotts of Israel might be politically, it is a priori wrong educationally. This is not just some epistemological abstraction. Three years ago, Brown hosted an event with Adi Ophir, current director of the Minerva Center at Tel Aviv University and then-visiting professor at Brown. After his planned participation was criticized by a pro-Palestinian organization, the Middle East Studies program director at Brown, Beshara Doumani, withdrew from the event. It stands to reason that there have been similar incidents that have gone unreported. A link to an Israeli institution should not preclude entirely the possibility of discussion and debate when links to those of other countries do not. Of course, there are those who would say that the circumstances justify the selective treatment, but that’s an argument about politics — not pedagogy. In sum, academic boycotts philosophically undermine a liberal education and deprive students of the opportunity to consider all views equally and decide which they prefer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It appears that four of nine “critical conversations” hosted by Middle East Studies have been about Israel. But these conversations all featured panels that were about as sympathetic to Israel as the Texas parole board is to death-row inmates. Not one has included an individual who defends Israel with half the intensity of the median panelist who criticizes it. Not surprisingly, this isn’t an oversight. At one of the conversations, a student expressed concern that the panel was so lopsided. The director of the Middle East studies program replied that because his approach to the conflict is perhaps the academic consensus, he did not feel obliged to include views that diverged from it in his panel.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I don’t mean to suggest professors can’t personally endorse boycotts of Israel. They can. Just as democracies have no choice but to extend their liberties to people who would deny them to others, to avoid censorship universities must brook professors who, to end where we began, allow their teaching to be choked by political passion. But talking about what should happen to Israel without talking with Israeli schools is like deciding policy on abortion without consulting any women. When an entire program routinely puts on activities with people who advocate boycotts of Israel — and almost never sees fit to present a contrary view — the pro-boycott position effectively ossifies into an unofficial policy. And that’s when “critical conversations” become critical only in the sense that they criticize Israel. </span></p>

		<title>Savello &#039;18: Rethinking TA sections</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As is natural for a second-semester senior, I have begun to reflect on my academic endeavors and evaluate which experiences I’ve found valuable at Brown — and which ones I’ve found not so valuable. Out of all of my experiences, I’ve found mandatory TA-led discussion sections the most in need of improvement.</p>
<p class="p2">As a current TA and a former student of various TA sections, I’ve found that these sections can be helpful and thought-provoking for students, providing them with an opportunity to engage with course material outside of the classroom, ask relevant questions and connect with peers. However, in many cases, these opportunities only exist in theory. In reality, this is only possible when the students are interested in attending and have questions to ask, a scenario which is far too often uncommon.</p>
<p class="p2">Unfortunately, for many students, TA sections are viewed as just another box to check on their to-do list, and it’s not unusual for them to show up solely for the purpose of getting attendance points while doing the bare minimum in section. As a result, the section can quickly turn into an empty time block, full of awkward silence, blank stares and bored students, who impatiently text or scroll through Facebook until the hour is up.</p>
<p class="p2">Having been on both sides, I know how unpleasant it can be for both the TAs and the students when participation is low. This lack of engagement creates an uncomfortable environment; it can discourage even interested students from participating and negate the potential benefit sections could have in encouraging students to speak. There have been countless times where I have sat there as a TA waiting for a response from a silent crowd; there have also been times where I have been the silent person in the back of the room staring at my TA as they attempt to provoke a discussion.</p>
<p class="p2">Sections have a lot of potential value: We should have a space to discuss course material and learn from each other outside of lecture. But given the fact that this is so often wasted, the question then stands: How do we improve section and boost student motivation? To start, we must identify the root of the problem, which in most cases, is the mandatory nature of the section. By making these TA-led sections a class requirement, usually in the form of attendance-based course credit, Brown essentially turns these sections into a transactional obligation rather than an opportunity to learn. Considering that the section is often not graded for quality of effort or participation but simply for attendance, it usually becomes the lowest academic priority and the first place students cut corners when they are short on time — which they usually are.</p>
<p class="p2">Ultimately, Brown should be aware that discussion sections, while beneficial in theory, can very quickly become a waste of time for both the TA and the student if the dynamics are not right. As a result, I encourage students, professors and TAs to consider the ways that they can rethink the section model to get the most value out of everyone’s time. This could take different forms for every class, from holding biweekly sections to transitioning to attendance-optional open office hours to eliminating section entirely.</p>
<p class="p2">Reducing the section meeting times from weekly to biweekly could boost engagement by giving students more time to get to the materials and come up with talking points. Students could also use the extra time to craft more thoughtful questions or responses instead of being rushed to do readings for back-to-back weekly discussions.</p>
<p class="p2">Further, if some of these sections were made optional, it would give students the opportunity to show up when they are actually interested in the content or when they have an important question — not solely to rack up attendance points. To be clear, making sections optional is not ideal in every course. As a language course TA, I strongly believe that the weekly discussion sections are necessary to help students improve their speaking abilities. Conversing in a foreign language in an informal setting is not something students normally have access to and is ultimately invaluable to language acquisition. However, for sections for reading-based introductory courses in which students simply go over articles, the need is much less pressing. Instead, optional office hours could be held if students have questions or want to discuss the materials further.</p>
<p class="p2">In some cases, holding section may not further the goals of the class at all, and in that case professors can consider removing it altogether. I encourage professors to take note of the feedback received in the Critical Review to ensure that sections are productive and useful for learning, and, if not, to consider alternative options such as Canvas discussions.</p>
<p class="p2">When professors are constructing a curriculum, it important to ensure time is being well-spent by both the TAs and the students. Though there is no one-size-fits-all solution, a more flexible section model can alleviate many of the problems that plague sections and foster more constructive discussions and engagement.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s taken fourteen months, but President Trump has finally figured out what’s wrong with America. In a recent 5:25 a.m. tweet following the Oscars, he <a href="http://ew.com/tv/2018/03/06/trump-oscars-ratings-tweet/">declared</a>: “Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore — except your President (just kidding, of course)!” His long history of self-aggrandizing statements would suggest that he is not kidding, but the tweet speaks to a broader schism that has existed between Trump and pop culture for decades. What began as mockery throughout Trump’s years as a businessman has transformed since he announced his candidacy into a self-stylized resistance, not just to the man himself, but to the cultural forces of intolerance and distrust that helped lead to his election. Highly recognizable media figures like Meryl Streep and Oprah have expanded their roles in the public sphere to become not just icons but cultural crusaders. This, presumably, is what Trump means when he writes that we don’t have “stars” anymore — because those stars are aligned against him.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yes, we have come a long way since Hollywood’s so-called Golden Age, when movie stars symbolized not politics or rancor or trending hashtags, but abstract, nonpartisan ideals like glamor and grace. But like so many presidential late-night tweets, this conceptualization is a fiction. The idea of Hollywood as the face of unpatriotic, even dangerous political sentiment is far from new, and the entertainment industry has never been sheltered from the political climate. In 1947, 40 movie industry employees were infamously subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee for their suspected Communist beliefs, and hundreds more were listed on a blacklist that prevented them from finding work over the following <a href="http://time.com/3513597/huac-hollywood-hearings/">decades</a>. Furthermore, movie stars and other popular entertainment industry icons draw their status almost entirely from <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/22/media/netflix-kevin-spacey-cost/index.html">popular opinion</a>. (Look no further than the #TimesUp movement to see how quickly superstar status can wither in the face of public outrage). If stars today would rather talk about political and social issues than more vapid concerns, they are supported at least in part by an audience that prizes and incentivizes engagement over apathy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As for the tone of the conversation, it is the job of entertainers to entertain. They know how to use showmanship and humor and sentiment to deliver maximum impact — methods that are not dissimilar to the ones Trump favors, though with the crucial difference of not being applied to actual policymaking or diplomacy. By combining sober political commentary with their core skill set, Hollywood’s activists are able to spread their message widely and effectively, perhaps even making their viewpoints seem more accessible, rather than less.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A call against the politicization of the Oscars could be on the surface considered a call for unity, for a momentary, well-deserved pause in partisanship. Why the focus on inclusion, representation and social movements? Why can’t awards shows just be nights devoted to black tie attire, too-long speeches and celebration of artistic achievement? Ironically enough, the answer can be found in Trump’s tweet. We have long looked to movie stars to define who we are as a nation — and that definition is changing. As women and people of color across America push toward cultural equality, that push is reflected on- and off-screen, in movements like #MeToo, #OscarsSoWhite and #AskHerMore and in Best Actress winner Frances McDormand’s call for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/movies/inclusion-rider-frances-mcdormand-oscars.html">inclusion riders</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nearly all Americans who reach household name status today are athletes, actors or politicians. In his opposition to the Take a Knee movement, Trump has already taken aim at the athletes who have attempted to make a political statement by insisting they should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests">keep to their sport</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fact that he is now doing the same with actors is notable and concerning, tying into a larger pattern of attacking high-profile critics and harkening back to his ominous <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/trump-rnc-speech-alone-fix-it/492557/">proclamation</a> at the 2016 Republican National Convention: “I alone can fix it.” Though we should not be entrusting untrained celebrities with key political decisions (yes, that includes Ivanka), we should still recognize the value of their contributions to the political sphere. We still have stars, but today many of those stars represent more than designer labels and paparazzi — they represent inclusion, empowerment and engaged citizenship. And they shine brighter for it.</span></p>

		<title>Miller &#039;19: Award shows are partisan echo chambers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Sunday, March 4, the 90th Oscar award ceremony took place, featuring a star-studded guest list, much laughter, long speeches and, of course, politics. Host Jimmy Kimmel could hardly wait 10 minutes before getting in a jab at President Trump and his cabinet. On the president, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/04/jimmy-kimmels-oscars-monologue-takes-aim-at-trump-pence-and-harvey-weinstein/?utm_term=.79e84aa5be04">he said</a>: “Wow, the stunning Lupita Nyong’o — she was born in Mexico and raised in Kenya. Let the tweetstorm from the president’s toilet begin.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The overt partisanship demonstrated by the Oscars is less than helpful to the important causes which the entertainment industry is trying to advance. Yes, free speech is free speech; but this opportunity to present important ideals is too rare and valuable to be squandered in a forum that showcases only liberal voices, affirms the opinions of like-minded viewers and shuns, offends and further entrenches an enormous voting bloc. What a waste of the important activist strides the Oscars could further with a little equanimity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Oscars serve as a powerful soap box to reach a wider audience — 26.5 million people in 2018 — and call widespread attention to pressing social issues. I believe that actors should be able to stand for the causes that matter to them and ensure that the rest of the population is exposed to their ideas. For example, the #MeToo movement condemning sexual assault would not have gained as much traction without the clout of celebrities. The Oscars were and will be a perfect stage to continue this discussion and many others to come.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> However, blind ridicule and wholesale disparagement of the values of the right completely undermine the inclusive stance many liberals purport to espouse and detract from the positive resolution of important issues that should not be swept under the rug. Derision without self-reflection only further entrenches each camp in their ideals and hardens party divisions. The Oscars are a great time to shine a light on our most pressing issues: gun control, sexual assault movements such as #MeToo and #TimesUp and racial discrimination. But when this happens alongside blatant mockery, it weakens the credibility and legitimacy of these movements. Derision may cause conservatives to discredit the entire message, or simply turn off their TVs and with it their minds.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Such one-sided exposure is hardly new, not isolated to the Oscars, and represents a greater trend in Hollywood and American awards shows. At this year’s Grammy award show, a plethora of celebrities, from Snoop Dogg to Hillary Clinton, read excerpts from the scathing White House “tell-all” book, “Fire and Fury”. Ben Shapiro, a conservative political commentator, tweeted in response: “Hillary Clinton reading ‘Fire and Fury’ at the Grammys is why Trump won. But actually. It is.” While there are virtually no things on which Shapiro and I agree, he might be on to something here. Clinton, a learned and highly competent woman, made a set of mistakes that contributed to her loss of the 2016 presidential election. Many have pegged her greatest folly as being “out of tune” with “real” Americans. Clinton ran a star-studded campaign and argued that the voting power of the white working class was no longer relevant in the face of liberal enlightened thoughts. At the ballot box, they proved her, and the many celebrities who supported her, to be wrong. Whether or not Clinton has learned the lesson, the Oscars show that her celebrity followers have not.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those who direct, speak and perform at the Oscars and those who laugh at the jokes are not ill-intentioned. In fact, they are mostly the opposite; a group of liberal-minded individuals looking to blow off steam after a tough electoral year and enact change. However, creating such a partisan Oscars does not help the progress of liberal ideals, and rather further isolates and alienates conservatives as “not welcome” in such events.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whether we like it or not, Republicans currently hold the power in the Senate, House and presidency. If we want to see change, Democrats cannot continue to chortle in their echo chamber every time there is a stage to do so. The true Kodak-moment will be once we give constructive criticism, or take our voting power to the ballot box in 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Brown students on a left-leaning campus, we should realize that change requires the embrace of individuals on all sides of the aisle. Ad hominem attacks are not helpful in the long run because they undermine the larger social discussions they attempt to further. Most importantly, they do not work.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Happiness, then, is apparently something complete and self-sufficient, since it is the end of the things achievable in action,” Aristotle <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-Mf5XV8q6CgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">said</a>. Writing in the fourth century B.C.E., he believed that happiness was distinct among humans’ goals in that “we always choose it because of itself, never because of something else.” His understanding of happiness — here a translation of the Greek word eudaimonia, a state obtained in large part through virtuous action — may differ greatly from ours, but on a basic level Aristotle was right: All our other goals are subsidiary to the ultimate goal of well-being. Happiness traditionally has been confined to the domain of philosophy, but recently the science of positive psychology has brought a new rigor to addressing some of life’s bigger questions. Fully understanding the complexities of happiness is paramount for Brown students and college students in general as we begin for the first time to confront major life decisions, such as those pertaining to our careers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Happiness is hard to define, but researchers often use it interchangeably with the term “<a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/application_uploads/Diener-Subjective_Well-Being.pdf">subjective well-being</a>,” a “broad concept that includes experiencing pleasant emotions, low levels of negative moods, and high life satisfaction,” according to “Subjective Well-Being: The Science of Happiness and Life Satisfaction” by Ed Diener, Shigehiro Oishi and Richard Lucas. Many psychologists are skeptical that we can even affect our own happiness and they have good reasons for their pessimism. Happiness is a highly genetic trait. A large-scale <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/application_uploads/Diener-Subjective_Well-Being.pdf">study</a>, for instance, of 837 nationally representative pairs of identical and fraternal twins recommended a model of five distinct genetic determinants of well-being. The depressing concept of hedonic adaptation, furthermore, dictates that we eventually adapt to all good and all bad events in life to return to a stable set point. In one oft-cited <a href="http://pages.ucsd.edu/~nchristenfeld/Happiness_Readings_files/Class%203%20-%20Brickman%201978.pdf">study</a>, winners of the lottery, after a period of time, were no happier than the paralyzed victims of accidents (though it is important to note that this concept has recently been subjected to greater nuance). A related concept is affective forecasting: We are in general poor judges at predicting how happy good events will make us and how unhappy bad events will make us. Participating in a study on affective forecasting, 571 undergraduates — who either were in romantic relationships or had recently ended one — were asked to predict their future emotional states and were evaluated thereafter. Those who had broken up soon became, contrary to their predictions, just as happy as those who were still in relationships.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So far the picture I have painted is bleak: that happiness seems to be in large part genetic and therefore in large part immutable. But researchers recognize that at least some of its factors are in our control. Different models have proposed various determinants of happiness. One such <a href="http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/wp-content/themes/sonjalyubomirsky/papers/LSS2005.pdf">model</a> breaks down happiness with these (albeit somewhat arbitrary) approximations: 50 percent of one’s happiness is due to a genetically determined set point; 10 percent to life circumstances, such as socioeconomic status, health and physical attractiveness; and 40 percent to “intentional activity,” certain behaviors, practices and mental habits that are conducive to well-being.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Anecdotally, at least, Brown students, who generally aim to be high-achieving, can devote a disproportionate amount of time to academic and professional success as measured by status or by money. To some extent, we are not misguided in doing so. There are, according to a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237751866_Happiness_and_Academic_Achievement_Evidence_for_Reciprocal_Causality">variety</a> of <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/edri/2012/643438/">studies</a>, correlations between happiness and a sense of achievement, both academic and social. But also of importance is the substance of the goals that one sets for oneself. One <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-007-9138-y">study</a>, for example, concludes that “non-zero sum goals, which include commitment to family, friends and social and political involvement, promote life satisfaction” whereas “zero sum goals, including commitment to career success and material gains, appear detrimental to life satisfaction.” Another <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2736104/">study</a>, which closely followed recent college graduates, found that, among these graduates, the pursuit of “intrinsic” goals such as deep and lasting relationships was much more associated with happiness than was the pursuit of “extrinsic goals” such as fame. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That money cannot buy happiness sounds like a platitude at which the pessimists among us are likely to scoff as mere wishful thinking, but there is some truth to it. There is, of course, a <a href="http://www.davidmyers.org/davidmyers/assets/Who.is.Happy.pdf">correlation</a> between the wealth of a country and the reported life satisfaction of its citizens, but within the developed world, money <a href="https://isps.yale.edu/research/publications/isps01-004">matters generally less</a> than we might suppose. An individual’s money correlates with emotional well-being, but, as one famous <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/deaton_kahneman_high_income_improves_evaluation_August2010.pdf">study</a> has found, only up to a certain point — roughly an annual income of $75,000 — beyond which the line plateaus. Recent <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-17293-002">research</a> has added nuance, highlighting the importance of the way in which people spend their money. For example, people who spend money on experiences rather than on material objects, or who donate it philanthropically, are more likely to be happy. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some of the most effective ways of enhancing happiness are not difficult, though they do require intention and effort. One way is to prioritize sleep, which is <a href="http://midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1270.pdf">associated</a> with positive benefits to emotional as well as physical health. Another way is to exercise. Physical exercise is <a href="http://midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1270.pdf">linked</a> to many psychological benefits and provides exercisers with a feeling of satisfaction as they reach the athletic goals they set for themselves. Major contributors to happiness are the quality of <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/hstein/NAMGILES.pdf">connections</a> with others, prosocial emotions such as <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/CompassionMeditation-PDF.pdf">compassion</a> and <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Post-AltruismHappinessHealth.pdf">kindness</a> and practices such as <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Baskin-InterventionForgiveness.pdf">reconciliation</a> and <a href="http://www.scn.ucla.edu/pdf/Tabibnia%20(2007).pdf">cooperation</a>. Personal practices include <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Thanks.html?id=2OyzetozsTsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">gratitude</a> and <a href="http://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/SCtheoryarticle.pdf">self-compassion</a>. Mindfulness-based stress reduction, a program of secular meditation with its roots in traditional Buddhist practices, has produced a tremendous body of literature on its efficacy in, for example, enhancing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22148989">positive emotions</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20427148?dopt=Citation">mitigating anxiety</a> and improving <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20427148?dopt=Citation">cognitive function</a>. This variety of meditation also has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26168376">shown</a> to alter the structure and the function of various regions of the brain. All of these positive traits are not merely characteristics of one’s personality, but can actually be cultivated. In order to do so, try out the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California at Berkeley’s free online <a href="https://ggsc.berkeley.edu/what_we_do/event/the_science_of_happiness">course</a>, The Science of Happiness — which, in keeping with Aristotle’s view, could be just as important as any Brown course — or come to a meeting of the Brown Meditation <a href="https://brownmeditation.wixsite.com/community">Community</a>, of which I am a part. Though everyone is different and enjoys different things, such steps are empirically more reliable ways of pursuing happiness than chasing elite jobs. Why stress yourself out so much over such relatively marginal sources of happiness when there are other, more actionable steps you can take?</span></p>

		<title>Thomas &#039;21: Being present for the future</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Course offerings for fall 2018 were released a few weeks ago on Courses@Brown. As I searched through the classes each department will offer next semester, I got excited thinking of all the various combinations of classes that I could take. The next day, I shared my excitement with a friend of mine, but they offered a different perspective. The way they saw it, right now, we’re taking the classes we got so excited about taking last semester. We were so eager to register for the classes we’re enrolled in at the moment but that excitement has moved away from the present and toward our future course load. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">My friend’s simple observation underscores a larger problem: Young people, especially college students, overlook the value of the present. We’re constantly thinking about the next step on our journey to somewhere else. Whereas for me, as a second-semester student, looking ahead is exemplified by course selections, I’ve seen my older peers get swept up in the search for summer jobs, full-time jobs in the “real world” or broadly anything outside of Brown. While it’s good to think about the future — as college is in a lot of ways another stepping stone on our path forward — it’s also important to be present, absorbing all of the knowledge we can and enjoying every moment of college. Now is the perfect time to turn being present into a practice that will sustain us for the rest of our lives.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Considering the future is not inherently harmful. It would be a bit unrealistic to imagine a college experience without thinking about what your degree will get you down the line. One of the main reasons people go to college is because of its implications for their future. A bachelor’s degree, for example, is necessary to find employment and enter the middle class in the modern economy. Couple the economic imperative of a college education and college students’ relentless ambition, and we have the perfect recipe for an all-consuming, future-oriented approach to life. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But what’s to come should be in the back of our minds, not the forefront. We should remember that, while our time at Brown is short, we shouldn’t discount the tools we gain here that will greatly assist us in our future endeavors. We have an incredible opportunity to be surrounded by some of the brightest minds in the world and are constantly presented with opportunities to acquire more knowledge. We should make sure that, in thinking about what lies ahead, we don’t forget about what the present provides us. Constantly looking ahead means just going through the motions and not fully making the mostof the experiences available here. Indeed, being present might be the best thing we can do in our journey toward our future. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Specifically, a future-oriented outlook runs counter to one of the major perks of college: the freedom to be uncertain. Students should take full advantage of the opportunity to explore things not immediately linked to their predetermined future career paths, especially at a place like Brown that prides itself on the open curriculum. To enter one’s first year of college with a hard plan of what one’s next four years and beyond will look like is fine, but there’s more to college than checking off the boxes to get where you want to go. If your heart is set on becoming a lawyer, not everything that you do on campus need be related to law. Instead of setting your sights exclusively on joining a pre-law society, branch out and try something you’re not so sure about. Broadening your scope and trying out things not directly linked to your future not only exposes you to new possibilities, but can also reinforce what you may have already known about your interests. What’s more, venturing outside of our traditional comfort zones will help us acquire more knowledge and experiences to draw from in our lives. But the benefits of such exploration are only obtained by striking a balance between thinking about the future and being present.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This balance is important as it has implications for our health. I wrote a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/30/thomas-21-second-semester-slump/">column</a> earlier this semester about how the pursuit of perfection can prove detrimental to the health of students. Staying in a future-oriented mindset has similar impacts. Psychologist Matt Killingsworth, whose work is primarily concerned with happiness, conducted a <a href="http://www.evidenceinmotion.com/blog/2016/06/06/the-importance-of-being-present/">study</a> related to wandering minds. He found that when people focused on the present, they self-reported being 10 percent happier than when they were mind-wandering. At Brown — and in college, more generally — we have a tremendous opportunity to turn being present into a sustained practice. As adulthood and life beyond Brown approach, now is the time to practice being present so that we have a handle on it before entering the chaotic real world, which places too large an emphasis on constant progress and multitasking. And as it turns out, being present is a valuable skill in the workplace. The <a href="http://www.cornerstonedynamics.com/the-amazing-benefits-of-being-present-at-work/">benefits</a> of being present include better business interactions, better problem-solving skills and increased productivity. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There’s no problem with pondering what the future has in store, but letting this inhibit our ability to actively engage with what’s happening now is a problem. Staying in the moment, in fact, will serve us once we make it to our destination. But so long as we continue to exclusively think about what lies ahead, we’ll never be happy. Instead, we must find a balance between the here and now and the future.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve put a lot of thought into how I take notes in class. Research shows that handwriting improves retention, as the slower process of handwriting forces students to absorb and summarize material while they take notes rather than transcribe a professor’s lectures word for word. Furthermore, I know that, like many students, I am susceptible to the distracting lure of Facebook and other social media sites. On the other hand, my handwriting is atrocious, and it is sometimes difficult for me to read my notes when it’s time to study. In the end, after significant trial and error, I’ve concluded that the risk of distraction outweighs my quasi-illegible handwriting, and that overall, handwritten notes are best for me academically.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet, according to the Wall Street Journal, professors across the nation are increasingly taking away the choice between taking notes by hand or via computer, citing the effectiveness of handwriting and the detrimental effects of multitasking. Brown professors are not immune to this phenomenon. For example, the syllabus for ECON 1110: “Intermediate Microeconomics,” which I took last spring, read: “Please do not use laptops or mobile phones in class (I don’t trust you not to browse Facebook! I was a student once too).” While research may show that taking notes by hand is best for the average student, banning the use of laptops ignores the individual needs of students and ignores students’ ability to make decisions about their own learning.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Brown’s open curriculum is is based on trust. Other schools have distribution requirements because they feel that students need institutional intervention to appropriately select classes, and students choose these schools because they feel that such interventions are helpful in choosing the right course load. Brown is different. Brown trusts that as students, we are best equipped to make decisions about our own learning, and we choose to attend this school because we have confidence in our ability to select classes without a restrictive framework. Of course, we won’t always make the right decisions, but then it’s our responsibility to deal with the consequences; making mistakes is part of the learning process. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Similarly, professors should trust students to make decisions about how to take notes in class, and while sometimes we might make the wrong choice — choosing to browse Facebook instead of taking notes — then it is our responsibility to deal with the consequences and make better decisions in the future. Making thoughtful choices and learning from mistakes, even for seemingly trivial decisions like note-taking, are important to our educational and personal development. So while professors should offer guidance, and perhaps even strongly recommend taking notes by hand, professors should also trust us to make decisions about how we best learn. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Furthermore, banning laptops burdens students with disabilities. Professors are required to allow students to type in class if they have official accommodations, as typing in class can be crucial for students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia. For example, the professor of my microeconomics class stated in their syllabus, “If you have special accommodations that require you to have access to a computer, please first speak to me about it.” Yet laptop bans require students to initiate an additional and potentially uncomfortable conversation about accommodations. More importantly, because students with disabilities will be the only ones able to use laptops in classes where laptop use is restricted, banning laptops essentially outs those students who may not want to disclose their disability to their peers. Personally, I have an accommodation to type for my exams. But, in past classes where laptop use was banned, I’ve opted to write my notes by hand — partially because I was discovering that I take better notes by hand, but also because I didn’t want to appear difficult or entitled or be the only student typing in class. For many students, though, handwritten notes are simply not an option. Thus, banning laptops places an unnecessary burden on students with disabilities. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The most convincing argument in favor of banning laptops is that one student’s multi-tasking may distract other nearby students. This is a legitimate concern, and professors should find ways to minimize this possibility, perhaps by asking students who type to sit in the back and sides of classrooms as one previous Herald columnist suggested. Yet, while professors should attempt to minimize distractions, the cost of banning laptops — limiting students’ ability to make choices about their own learning and exposing student with disabilities — is too high to justify a ban. Professors should offer guidance, but at the end of the day, professors must trust their students to make the right decisions about their own academic experiences. </span></p>

		<title>Foster &#039;19: Cooling towers won’t cut it</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The days are getting longer, and nor’easters notwithstanding, they’ll start getting warmer too. Soon we’ll all be out on the Main Green, soaking in the sun between (or in spite of) assignment deadlines. But as students enjoy the rising temperatures, Brown Dining Services employees know that something else is looming on the horizon — another summer without air conditioning in the campus’ largest dining hall.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the summer, Brown opens its doors to Summer@Brown students who are eager to spend several weeks on campus. These students eat their meals at the Ratty, along with Summer@Brown residential advisors and undergraduates taking summer courses. The kitchens of the Ratty, located in the heart of the building, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/13/dining-services-gets-heat-lack-ac-ratty/">reach triple-digit temperatures during the summertime</a>. The full-time staff members who work in the Ratty are subjected to hot, humid and poorly ventilated conditions that cause dehydration and fainting. Worse still, staff numbers are scaled back during the summer. This means that employees are working harder and in worse conditions than they do during the academic year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dining Services employees have been asking for a solution to this problem for years. Air conditioning would make scorching kitchens bearable, allowing workers to make it through their shifts safely. This problem resurfaces year after year. There is still no air conditioning.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last summer, after students voiced their concern with this state of affairs, Brown agreed to rent cooling towers and place them in the kitchens of the Ratty. Cooling towers combine fans and cool mist to provide localized relief. The combined forces of cooling towers, additional breaks and extra water weren’t enough. The kitchens were still too hot<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— fans and mist just aren’t enough to cool a large scale commercial kitchen during the middle of summer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When the summer came to an end, the cooling towers disappeared. There was no guarantee that they would be back in the summer of 2018. And so Dining Services employees have been placed in the same situation they’ve been in before — no way to stay cool in the kitchen during a sweltering summer. This problem requires a permanent solution: air conditioning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The administration may argue that because the Ratty is old, it would be difficult to install the infrastructure necessary to cool the kitchens. There is some truth to this argument — retrofitting an old building’s HVAC system is likely complicated. But that’s not an excuse. If the long-term solution is far away, then we need a better stopgap. Portable AC units are used in other University buildings without central air. There’s little reason not to extend the same rights to workers at the Ratty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dining Services employees work for students every day. When a snowstorm hits and the University is closed, the Ratty is not. Dining Services employees brave snowstorms so that students have a place to eat. When many students leave for holiday breaks, the Ratty stays open for those who remain on campus. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Here’s the thing — even if you’re off meal plan (like me) or spend all your credits at Jo’s and haven’t set foot in the Ratty since freshman year unit dinner, you should still care. Because the bottom line is this: Dining Services employees deserve to go to work in conditions that don’t make them faint. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s time for the student body to stick up for the people who literally put food on our tables. If you’re interested in getting involved with this issue, consider attending the Student Labor Alliance’s second community meeting, which will take place Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Smith-Buonanno Hall B 106.</span></p>

		<title>Overall &#039;19: The Israel Fund is undeniably political</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In late 2016, the Israel Fund was established at Brown. An endowment created from alum donations, the Fund seeks to support new and existing programs and courses centered on Israel. As The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/25/alums-support-israel-fund-first-regional-endowed-fund/">previously reported</a>, the University has raised $3.8 million toward a $10 million goal for the Israel Fund’s endowment. Upon reaching the $10 million goal, the Fund will return $500,000 annually for a programming budget. In the face of accusations leveled against the Fund by Brown Students for Justice in Palestine that call out the inherent injustice of creating an academic fund for Israel-related programming, Interim Director of Judaic Studies David Jacobson told The Herald that the Fund’s intention is “purely academic, not political.”</p>
<p class="p1">But because the Israel Fund was created without any involvement or critical input from the Middle East Studies department’s faculty, it is nearly impossible for the Israel Fund to be apolitical. If Brown was hoping to foster an academic conversation about Israel through the Israel Fund, it started a conversation encumbered by the bias associated with the Fund’s sponsorship. When money is given to fund the study of a specific nation or national context, nothing is apolitical, even if there are some moderate steps taken to create nuance in the conversation. The Israel Fund is an expressly political initiative that implies the University’s support for Israel, owing to its top-down origins and its close links to Israeli business.</p>
<p class="p1">In an attempt to distance Brown’s Israel Fund from a politicized rhetoric, Jacobson’s statement that the Fund is “purely academic” unfortunately lacks substance, for two main reasons. The first way the Israel Fund departs from its purported academic aims is the nature of its inception. As Professor Beshara Doumani, director of the Middle East Studies program, told The Herald, “the Middle East Studies faculty have never been approached about this . . . It would be great if we had more information or were brought into the loop of what the thinking is and what the plans are.” The Middle East Studies faculty had not heard about the Israel Fund before the Jan. 30 <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/01/israel-fund">press release</a> that announced its establishment or the fact that the Fund had been in the works for over a year, he said. Since Israel is, in fact, located in the Middle East, the exclusion of the Middle East Studies faculty raises a red flag about the so-called “academic” intent of the Fund.</p>
<p class="p1">Further, in comparison to other academically oriented and regionally focused groups that exist on campus, the Israel Fund was created from the top-down with money from external donors. It seems ill-fitting for the Fund to flaunt academic roots and integrity when the ideas for the Fund were not generated within any scholarly framework of a department or program. Typically, if there is a genuine, grassroots demand for the creation of a scholarly program within the University, students and faculty will take the lead, organize on a grassroots level and work to transform their institutional objectives into reality. In the case of the Israel Fund, however, it seems that the wishes of wealthy alums have been uncritically mapped onto the University, without any apparent organic demand from students.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Israel Fund’s self-proclaimed “academic” origins are disingenuous, given that Brown is home to a broad range of grassroots, student-led and scholarly organizations and initiatives that are trying to get certain programs of study institutionalized. In fact, five years ago, Middle East Studies spearheaded the New Directions in Palestinian Studies Initiative. “New Directions” aims to shape scholarly works in the field of Palestinian studies through annual workshops at Brown and a book series that brings together emerging and established scholars. Brown Students for Justice in Palestine is another student-led group on campus that stands in solidarity with the Palestinian fight for equality and freedom, and supports the boycott, divestments and sanction movement. Additionally, consider the Southeast Asian Studies Initiative, an entirely student-led and student-driven project that seeks to enhance the visibility of Southeast Asia in the University’s academic offerings and faculty. Students involved in SEASI have had to advocate intently for the intellectual value of <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/26/students-push-southeast-asian-studies-development/">Southeast Asian studies</a>, developing their own independent studies. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Despite the Israel Fund’s efforts to support academic programs that, in the words of the Fund’s supporters, aim to “introduce students to the Palestinian experience,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>teach students “to see things through other peoples’ eyes,”and study — rather than reproduce — the “power imbalance” inherent in the narrative of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the secretive and exclusive origins of this Fund undermine its seemingly peaceful academic pursuits.</p>
<p class="p1">The second way the Israel Fund assumes elements of a political project — as opposed to a purely academic one — is its inclusion of not only academic programs, but also entrepreneurial enterprises. Last summer, the University launched the Israel Entrepreneurship Internship program. According to Executive Director of the Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship Danny Warshay ’87 P’20, students “not only got to experience what it’s like to work at a startup, … (but) they also got a cross-cultural experience to see what it was like to live in another international culture.” While Jacobson defends the Israel Fund as having solely a “academic” purpose, the Fund’s blatant business component proves this rhetoric is misleading.</p>
<p class="p1">By allocating a portion of the Fund’s capital to support Brown students immersed in tech startups, the Fund closely and undeniably aligns itself with Israeli politics. It is, after all, Israel’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/08/29/344030354/with-home-grown-technology-israel-becomes-leading-arms-exporter">technology and science sectors</a> that have led to the development of drones, armed bulldozers, border fences and surveillance equipment that are used to carry out violence against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-protest-clashes.html">Palestinians</a>. As a result, the internships funded by the Israel Fund will most likely reveal to students, through a “cross-cultural experience,” the single-story narrative of how developed, tech savvy and forward-looking Israeli society is. And, in the process, the University — which allowed for little community deliberation about the potential pitfalls of the Israel Fund —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>becomes complicit in the systems of racial and ethnic oppression synonymous with Israeli policies today.</p>
<p class="p1">Even if the Israel Fund’s academic programs have any redeeming qualities, the Fund’s internship component directly places the Fund within a political framework. It is important to remember that while region-specific programs and scholarly initiatives are integral to pursuing a holistic and liberal education, the methods by which some programs are implemented can, in fact, undermine their academic intentions. In terms of the Israel Fund, its top-down creation and internship component transform the Fund into a political tool. As Brown students, it is our job to remain continuously engaged in and constructively critical of the University’s academic endeavors. The Israel Fund is the perfect opportunity to unite as a community and speak out against an alum-driven and potentially dangerous political project masquerading as an academic program.</p>

		<title>Johnson &#039;20: Don’t romanticize destructive habits</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the American College Health Association, nearly one out of five university students is affected by anxiety or depression. There are many reasons why these disorders may be <a href="https://theconversation.com/1-in-5-college-students-have-anxiety-or-depression-heres-why-90440">prevalent</a> on college campuses, including smartphone addiction, the rising cost of college and mental overexhaustion. Nearly all students at Brown experience some form of mental overexhaustion at least once during their time here. Often, balancing a rigorous course load, extracurriculars and a social life can lead to burnout; however, it’s important to note that romanticizing a stressful and busy lifestyle can lead to further exhaustion. This obsession with having a busy life can negatively affect not only the school culture but also students’ mental health. Unfortunately, this is a common occurrence at Brown; in 2012, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-buzz/post/georgetown-johns-hopkins-make-newsweeks-list-of-most-stressful-colleges/2012/08/30/8a257a4e-f2a2-11e1-a612-3cfc842a6d89_blog.html?utm_term=.fff8ad13bf45">Newsweek</a> ranked Brown as the sixth most stressful school in America.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Around midterm season, it’s not uncommon to overhear conversations that revolve around people one-upping each other when it comes to who is “the most” overwhelmed. If one person says that they have two exams that week, someone else will respond that they have two exams that day. While it may seem unusual for people to be competitive about overexhaustion, it can be thought of as a result of our success-driven society. According to a Harvard <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/alesina/files/work_and_leisure_in_the_u.s._and_europe.pdf">study</a>, Americans work 50 percent more hours than Europeans. The study suggests that Americans do this because of our cultural notion that hard work equals success. Our society focuses on input rather than output. It is the reason why many are willing to pull all-nighters and run on nothing but caffeine on a daily basis in order to be successful. In addition to this, many college students tend to romanticize academic stress since it is easier to talk about than social stress. Many people usually experience their social difficulties privately, making them feel further alienated, but a sense of companionship tends to be <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2017/10/work-stress.html">established</a> when students discuss academic-related stress with each other as a bonding mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sometimes, it may be impossible for someone to avoid pulling an all-nighter, especially during a busy time in the semester. And it can be nice to rant to other students about the stress we feel. However, the obsession with a busy and stressed lifestyle can have a detrimental impact on individuals and on the college campus as a whole. For individual students, numerous <a href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-sleep-disorder#1">studies</a> have shown that over time, low sleep levels contribute to higher rates of anxiety, depression, poor academic performance and obesity. In addition to this, someone with work addiction may begin to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/addiction/work#symptoms">engage</a> in compulsive work in order to avoid addressing other problems in their life, like personal crises or troubling emotional issues. And in terms of affecting the college campus overall, commonly discussing who has the most work or the least sleep can promote poor mental health and encourage destructive behaviors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While there is value in hard work, it also important to not romanticize overexhaustion in order to ensure that students’ mental health is not being compromised. There are ways that students can make sure they achieve a balanced, healthy work ethic and lifestyle. For one, many people become addicted to stress once they move from “I feel stressed” to “I am stressed.” When people strongly identify with an emotion, it can become their <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/08/how-to-use-stress-to-your-advantage">definition</a> of self. It’s important to remember that stress is not a reality; it is a bodily response to a feeling about a situation in the moment. By letting go of that attachment to the feeling, you can gain more perspective and be able to move forward from that emotion. It may be also helpful to step back and think about why you romanticize stress. If it’s because you are motivated by stress and the feeling of accomplishing things, use this to your advantage when completing work, but set healthy boundaries like going to bed at a decent hour in order to make sure your mental health is not at stake. If this obsession comes as a way to avoid personal issues, you may want to consider scheduling a session with Counseling and Psychological Services. Regardless of the reason, it’s important for us all to rethink our relationships with stress and take steps to establish healthy habits that will positively impact our mental health.</span></p>

		<title>Simshauser &#039;20: Rethinking Democrats’ strategy for 2020</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following the 2016 presidential election — as the initial shock of President Trump’s victory began to wane — liberals looked to exit polling data, attempting to diagnose the exact factors that had felled Hillary Clinton’s ostensibly sturdy “blue wall.” Almost immediately, the narrative began to center on the white working-class voter, the demographic Trump had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html">overwhelmingly carried</a> by a margin of ​67 to 28 percent​. This aligned with anecdotal evidence, and emphasized the image of the disaffected white voter, who had been alienated by the stereotypical “coastal liberal elite.” News coverage — already prone to over-covering the racialized notion of the “Real American” — accelerated this idea, which posited that Democrats had to soften their advocacy on progressive social issues if they wanted to win elections. However, such a shift in strategy runs the risk of compromising Democratic ideals, particularly on immigration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In recent days, the ​Pew Research Center has released <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/20/changing-composition-of-the-electorate-and-partisan-coalitions/">survey​s</a> that reinforce this point of view and starkly contradict exit polling data. Multiple studies have shown that the ​proportion​ of white voters without a college degree was severely underestimated.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/upshot/trump-losing-college-educated-whites-he-never-won-them-in-the-first-place.html"> Exit polls</a> estimated that the white working class — used here to indicate whites without a college degree — comprised 34 percent of the total 2016 electorate. In reality, they cast <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/upshot/trump-losing-college-educated-whites-he-never-won-them-in-the-first-place.html">44 percent of votes</a>, a disparity of 13.5 million individuals. Moreover, initial exit polls had concluded that whites with a college degree were the largest demographic in the Democratic party. In fact, non-college-educated whites are the largest bloc of the party’s voters, outnumbering whites with a college degree by 33 to 28 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is a reckoning for the Democratic party; it repudiates the idea that supposed “elites” are the overwhelming force on the left. At the same time, however, it magnifies the white working-class bloc even more in elections — affirming the beliefs of those advocating that Democrats move further to the center. This is distressing for progressives, who had found solace in viewing the white working class as more or less a lost or relatively unimportant cause, particularly given the overwhelming support for Democrats among nonwhite voters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The revelation that non-college-educated white voters make up almost half of the electorate could be the impetus for moderating actions, like easing the party stance on abortion or gun control. Conor Lamb, who won a Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump carried by 20 points, marketed himself as this sort of Democrat. In addition to being pro-life and pro-gun, he even ran ads where he explicitly opposed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and her “California liberalism.” However, in the case of a general national election, there is reason to believe these moderating tactics would not suffice, primarily because of one unresolvable issue: immigration. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Social scientists who analyze the cultural divide among electoral voting blocs have focused on immigration as the wedge issue. This is not surprising; Trump harnessed his initial support by taking a hard line on immigration. By arguing broadly against immigration​ — rather than debating policy around reforming the system — he shifted the paradigm surrounding the immigration debate within national politics. Through his championing of a border wall and his denigration of foreigners entering the country, he coalesced the ardent support of non-college-educated white voters. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The immigration debate is a flashpoint into the larger divide between college-educated and non-college-educated white voters. College-educated whites believe that immigrants strengthen the country by a margin of 52 to 35 percent; conversely, 61 percent of white working-class voters — defined by the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/06/24/on-immigration-the-white-working-class-is-fearful/">study in question</a> as whites who did not graduate from college and are paid by the job or by the hour — say that immigrants weaken the nation. ​William Galston of the Brookings Institute​ incisively notes the larger forces at work in these numbers: “working-class whites are experiencing a pervasive sense of vulnerability … on every front — economic, cultural, personal security — they feel threatened and beleaguered.” Trump won these voters by a much larger margin than Mitt Romney did in 2012 because he made immigration an issue of race politics, not of policy. Amongst voters who listed immigration as the biggest issue in the election, 64 percent voted for Trump, compared to 32 percent for Clinton.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pew’s realization of the magnified influence of non-college-educated white voters, then, is somewhat alarming for Democrats. Looking at immigration as a flashpoint, the argument could be made that attempting to moderate on cultural issues like gun control would not be enough in a general election against a Republican party that has shifted toward the views of extremists like Sen. Tom Cotton, R-AR, on immigration. In the 2012 election, both parties made the question of immigration one of reform. Trump made it a far more personal question: Who belongs in this country? The resonance of his stance is clear; there is still substantial support among Trump voters for a border wall, a physical bulwark for those attempting to hold on to their cultural status.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For Democrats, while the data advocate an even stronger push toward the moderate white voter, the debate regarding immigration could stand as an uncrossable threshold. This ought to catalyze deeper debate regarding strategy in the next general election: Should Democrats be focused on turnout of progressive voters, or persuasion of the elusive “Obama-Trump” voter? This is an incomplete picture and does not acknowledge issues such as racially targeted voter suppression or Russian interference. But the partisan — and cultural — divide between college-educated and non-college-educated white voters implies that the perception of the status of whites in this country was the wedge issue upon which Trump seized support.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Engaging in nativist and racist rhetoric on immigration is obviously a line in the sand that Democrats will not and should not cross. But the resonance of the immigration debate goes far deeper than other cultural issues in voters’ attitudes. The “Obama-Trump” voter, whose vote Democrats so badly covet, may not be persuaded by slight moves to the center from Democrats. And if the Democratic ticket ignores the progressive wing of the party on too many social issues, they risk alienating more voters from the left than they would win over on the right.</span></p>

		<title>Mulligan &#039;19: Class of 2022: Is the open curriculum for you?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As potential members of the class of 2022 ponder whether or not to accept Brown’s offer of admission, many of them will no doubt be swayed by the open curriculum. Whenever I hear conversations among my peers about why we chose Brown, the opportunity to forge our own academic path inevitably emerges as a top reason.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yet as semesters pass, I find myself evaluating the open curriculum with a more balanced eye, and from conversations I’ve overheard among classmates, I know I’m not alone. The open curriculum is a key component of the Brown experience but evaluating it without rose-colored glasses would help us see what we really want from our education. Reflection would allow potential students to develop a better perspective on whether Brown is the place for them.</span></p>
<p class="p3">A quick review: According to a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/curriculum">University webpage</a>, the open curriculum, which was instated almost fifty years ago, is designed to allow students “maximum flexibility” in their education. While students must complete a concentration and demonstrate competency in written communication, they are otherwise free to choose how they spend their academic time. Unlike most colleges, Brown students are not required to take a foreign language, a science class with a laboratory component or any other general educational requirement.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There are many benefits to this freedom. Because students do not have to spend course hours attaining mandatory credits, it is easier to have multiple concentrations. The ease of double concentrating, as compared to schools where a second major must be completed </span><span class="s2">on top of core requirements, means that students can add an additional concentration if they discover a new area of academic interest later in their time at Brown. It is also easier for students to combine seemingly disparate areas of study. I know people who concentrate in visual art while on a pre-med path, or who double concentrate in computer science and classics. While these paths would be possible at other universities, there’s no doubt that they would be harder to follow if general educational requirements got in the way.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But while some students rise to the challenge offered by the open curriculum, others use it as a safety net. Double concentrating in two humanities, I can’t count the number of times I’ve heard my classmates joke about having not taken a math or science course since high school. The open curriculum makes it possible to explore courses in departments that you would not have had time for if burdened with general educational requirements, but at the same time, it makes it entirely possible to stay confined within your comfort zone.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is something to be said for being able to dive deeply into one subject as an undergraduate. As a first-year, I was already taking courses in my concentrations while my friends at other schools spent their first few semesters solely fulfilling distribution requirements. The open curriculum makes it possible to focus intensely on one area of academia, taking more courses in one department than a student at a different school would have the opportunity to.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The problem with comfort zones isn’t that they limit your studies to an area you love — it’s that they keep you from discovering new interests. I have always enjoyed studying history and English, but I realized recently that I would have benefited from a stronger foundation in sociology and anthropology. Like many students, I was not exposed to these subjects in high school, and so I went several years without fully understanding how they would supplement my education. And I fully admit that I am one of those concentrators in the humanities who has used the open curriculum to avoid subjects that sound unappealing. Though I have explored many departments, I have only taken one STEM class. My education has helped me learn to think in a variety of ways, but I’m not sure I have “Experience(d) Scientific Inquiry,” one of Brown’s Liberal Learning Goals.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As an upperclassman, I’ve occasionally found myself wishing that when I first came to Brown, I was forced to take courses outside of my known academic interests. It’s hard enough <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/20/mulligan-19-re-orientating-attitude-toward-loneliness/">adjusting to college</a> in the first place, and amid the chaos of living in an entirely new environment, I expect it’s normal to focus on classes that instantly pique your interest. Yet I wonder if I would have discovered some latent interest if I had been required to explore other curricular areas early in my time at Brown. It’s a bit too late to completely upend my academic plans, though I have been trying to take courses in new departments. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m reminded of something a classmate, also a junior and also double concentrating in two non-STEM subjects, said recently: If she could redo her time at Brown, she would be majoring in two hard sciences, subjects to which she had only recently been introduced. As a first-year, she was too intimidated to enroll in courses she worried she would not do well in.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Perhaps, then, the problem here isn’t the open curriculum itself, but that it allows us to run from our fear of failure. The students who come here are generally used to succeeding, and even measures like taking any course S/NC or not having a GPA don’t reduce the emotional difficulty of dealing with a poor grade. That’s a problem that won’t go away without a major culture shift, and although the open curriculum may exacerbate it by letting students avoid potential failures, its existence is not the open curriculum’s fault.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As admitted students choose whether or not to attend Brown, the open curriculum will likely factor into their decision, one way or another. I encourage them to think about what it offers and what its limitations are. Do you want to explore academically? And if so, do you feel able to do that yourself, or would you benefit from outside assistance? The open curriculum is an excellent opportunity but it isn’t inherently better than a traditional curriculum, and acknowledging that can help determine if Brown offers the opportunities to grow that a student seeks.</span></p>

		<title>Cardoso ’19: Ending legacy admissions will help focus on access</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In his March 5 op-ed, Dean of Admission Logan Powell argues that a fixation on legacy admission is a distraction from the University’s efforts to increase access for underrepresented groups <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/05/powell-dispelling-legacy-myths-help-focus-access/">on campus.</a> Yet while Powell highlights much of the progress the University has made in expanding access to low-income and first-generation applicants, his piece is, itself, an effort at obfuscation. Despite his best efforts to disentangle the two, the University’s legacy admission policy and its efforts at increasing access to low-income and first-generation communities are intimately connected. The University, despite its earnest efforts at increasing diversity on campus, must end the use of legacy status in admission entirely if it hopes to truly create a meritocratic admission policy that places a premium on equal access for underrepresented communities.</p>
<p class="p2">Perhaps most central to Powell’s argument is the idea that legacy admission and expanding efforts to admit low-income students are not mutually exclusive. This is true in a very technical sense, but misleading. For instance, Powell is correct in noting that the University has been making good-faith efforts to expand financial aid to low-income students and take into consideration factors like low-income and first-generation status during the admission process. Though it is true that the University can expand on these efforts while simultaneously continuing its legacy admission policy, the latter is still an obstacle to its broader objective of increasing access. Fundamentally, every spot given to a legacy applicant is one that is not given to another applicant.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, Powell attempts to preempt this argument by stating legacy status is one of many “tie-breakers.” But there is substantial evidence to suggest that this is generally untrue at elite universities. For instance, one Princeton study found that, among applicants to elite universities, having a parent that previously attended the university was equivalent to scoring an additional 160 points on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204653604577249230164868846?ns=prod/accounts-wsj">the SAT.</a> Similarly, one study of approximately 30 top universities in the United States found that legacy status increased an applicant’s chances of admission by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/04/07/why-do-colleges-still-give-preference-to-children-of-alumni/?utm_term=.7b09df360de2">45 percent.</a> Surely one cannot believe that Brown’s admission policy vis-a-vis legacy applicants is so different from its peers without hard evidence to substantiate the claim. And if Brown is, in fact, using legacy status as more than a tie-breaker, it becomes patently obvious that non-legacy applicants, including applicants from low-income and first-generation backgrounds, are being pushed aside.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite the length of his piece, Powell devotes very little time to defending the use of legacy status in the admission process. The defenses he does provide are facile. For instance, he argues that legacy students are uniquely equipped to guide other students through their time at the University, yet he provides no evidence to substantiate this claim, beyond the sanguine assumptions that legacy students are exceptionally knowledgeable about Brown and eager to serve as community mentors. What’s more, Powell notes that legacy applicants generally support the University’s financial priorities. According to several studies, this is generally not the case. In the book “Affirmative Action for the Rich,” contributor Chad Coffman notes that among several universities that dropped their legacy preference policies, there was consequently negligible fluctuation in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Affirmative-Action-Rich-Preferences-Admissions/dp/0870785192">alum donations.</a></p>
<p class="p2">In the ultimate analysis, using legacy status in the admission process is wrong for two reasons. Firstly, it is profoundly unmeritocratic. While policies that seek to increase access for underrepresented groups are valuable to the extent that they allow talented and deserving students to compete in a system that is generally biased against them, considering legacy status in admission gives additional advantages to applicants that often already had substantial advantages to begin with. But secondly, and perhaps most importantly, in defending the use of legacy status in the admission process, Powell and the University are undermining the very goal of access that they claim to value. This is not to question the University’s good-faith commitment to expanding access to underrepresented communities. But if we, as a community, want to cast off the legacy of elitism that is pervasive among top-tier universities and make our campus totally accessible to underrepresented groups, we must end legacy admission once and for all.</p>

		<title>Liang &#039;19: Inviting Jeb Bush to speak is responsible</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Michael Froid ’21 wrote an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/06/froid-21-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-irresponsible/">op-ed</a> published in The Herald on April 6 that argues against the University’s <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/05/jeb-bush-to-speak-as-ogden-lecturer-april-25/">decision</a> to invite Jeb Bush to give the Stephen A. Ogden Jr. ’60 Memorial Lecture on International Affairs. Froid’s op-ed is an excellent piece, and it makes this dissent especially difficult to put together. Both Froid and I disagree with nearly every one of Bush’s social, political and economical viewpoints.</p>
<p class="p2">But let me be blunt. Millions of Americans share Bush’s views, and ignoring this central fact is not helpful. <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/">Forty percent</a> of Americans believe abortion should be illegal. Thirty-three percent of Americans still <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/record-percentage-americans-support-gay-marriage-poll-finds-n799376">oppose</a> same-sex marriage. In sum, over a third of U.S. citizens believe in things Froid calls “morally unjustifiable.” This number is most likely way above the proportion of Brown students who also believe those things and is in no way aligned with my own ideals, but it is the reality of the country we live in. So I’m saddened to hear about the backlash against the University’s invitation to Jeb Bush to speak at Brown because inviting him is one of the most responsible things this University can do.</p>
<p class="p2">I don’t want speakers who perfectly “represent the values of Brown students,” as Froid writes, because these speakers aren’t students. They’re an educational opportunity. I want to learn how the other side of the aisle thinks. I want to know what it values, what it believes and what it prioritizes. The real world is a hodgepodge of ideas that can offend and humiliate. If we want to lower the percentages of Americans who support “morally unjustifiable” ideas, those who can have to learn about the viewpoints that make us angry and marginalized. We don’t have to elevate them or even agree with them, but we have to recognize that they are there and learn how to beat them.</p>
<p class="p2">Let’s stop pretending the controversy over Bush’s invitation is a question about qualifications. The Odgen lecture has hosted senators, CEOs and even a newspaper columnist. Having direct experience in the State Department or equivalent is obviously not a requisite. This backlash is a partisan one: Bush’s very association with the Republican Party causes shrieks all over campus. This reaction is not surprising: After all, it is 2018, and President Trump is in office. It’s interesting to me that students have not criticized the Ogden Lecture for its other invitees, such as the President of Colombia or the Ambassador of Iran to the United States — representatives of countries with human rights records that make Froid’s grievances against Bush pale in comparison.</p>
<p class="p2">Further, it isn’t meaningful to evaluate a politician’s policy agenda using the measure of morality. If I were asking Bush a question at this lecture, it wouldn’t be about how he justifies his “unjustifiable morals.” What sort of person would be able to answer that honestly? Rather, I’d ask him how his marriage views comply with the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment, because according to the Supreme Court, they don’t. I’d ask him about Roe vs. Wade and the multiple models of Florida flooding under rising sea waters. Froid writes, “Individuals of moral character do not hold these indefensible positions.” But “moral character” means different things to different people, based on their own philosophical interpretations — the same interpretations that let both the left and right call themselves righteous. Policy implications and the Constitution are more concrete than morality, and evaluating Bush’s positions against these definitive benchmarks by asking him questions, in person, is far more productive.</p>
<p class="p2">In a more immediate sense, refusing to invite conservative figures like Bush does not help Brown students express their own worldviews and refine their grasp of policy. When Froid writes that Bush’s views are “unjustifiable, dehumanizing and rooted in ignorance,” I am reminded of the time that administrators had to cut short an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/10/30/ray-kelly-lecture-canceled-amidst-student-community-protest/">event</a> with Raymond Kelly, the police commissioner who supported the stop-and-frisk policing policy that disproportionately affected people of color. We were gonna grill him to the end of the world, man! We were going to show him that we as students knew the statistics, facts and evidence that proved his policy agenda wrong and misguided. But students, of all political stripes, never had the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of criminal justice and even have a conversation. How can we prove to Americans that we have better ideas than conservatives if we don’t engage at all with conservative speakers who come to campus?</p>
<p class="p2">Here’s what I propose. Let Jeb Bush come. But the University should sponsor talks and workshops before and after the event that tackle why his ideas can marginalize communities, how progressive politics can win and how young liberals should interact with the American right. Instead of just calling his ideas “morally unjustifiable and outrageous,” let’s tell Bush why. Student groups should make safe spaces as they deem necessary, but also mobilize together to create the most impact on campus discourse — impact that I think is only possible if Bush comes to campus. Boycott the lecture, or go dressed in black shirts and dark shades, holding up signs that spell out “PLEASE CLAP.” But let Jeb Bush speak so we can hold him accountable for every word he says, or God knows he’ll just find another place to say whatever he wants with little opposition. Show him the strength of our conviction and the intelligence of our discourse — let’s show him who we are as a Brown community.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Early on in my Brown career, I ascended the five-story staircase in the List Art Center, and level by level, discovered an ever-changing, floor-to-ceiling mural showcasing Brown’s most creative artists. When I introduce prospective students to Brown, I bring them to that staircase to view a unique side of our campus, an embodiment of the creative energy of our student body. I often wonder why Brown does not have more spaces like this.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown currently has a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/public-art/percent-art">“Percent-for-Art”</a> program, which ensures that “one percent of the construction budget of all new buildings and major renovations is devoted to the commission of artwork for the building or grounds.” While this project has contributed some of Brown’s most beautiful and memorable spots on campus, often featuring gracious gifts from alums, wouldn’t some of these spaces be further enriched by incorporating students’ art?</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown has a large and valuable untapped resource: visual arts concentrators and Brown-RISD dual degree students. Even more striking, in 2017, about <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/03/bai">60 percent</a> of students cited an art-related subject as their primary extracurricular interest. Just as students in other disciplines seek publication as validation of their experience in literary and laboratory endeavors, our art students should have more opportunities to contribute to their campus and gain artistic experience and credentials. There is a trove of students whose artistic contributions would enhance Brown’s spaces. </span></p>
<p class="p2">In 2017, Brown launched the Brown Arts Initiative to “fully integrate the arts into a complete liberal arts <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/03/bai">education.”</a> This project included increased access to the arts across departments and “new opportunities for teaching, research, artmaking, performance and experimentation.” It is intended to cement Brown’s commitment to the arts by creating more opportunities for students to engage through increased access to the arts and artists. However, the Initiative often focuses on bringing to Brown works of artists from outside of the Brown community. While we continue to enjoy the work of these artists, the Initiative should look to further integrate Brown art students into the process and allow them to leave a tangible impact on their campus.</p>
<p class="p2">Public art has positive benefits beyond just providing student artists with opportunities to showcase their work. For instance, it can have a positive mental impact on its viewers. Studies have shown public art can reduce levels of stress, foster an increased feeling of community and promote positive <a href="https://artmoi.com/blog/public-art-is-good-for-your-health/">health behaviors.</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Increasing public art will not only help the student artists behind the projects but also benefit other students and the community.</p>
<p class="p2">One need not look further than the BioMedical Center and List to see the value of public art. The huge posters adorning the facades of these buildings show photographic scenes of the impact of climate change in the Arctic. The posters are part of a larger initiative, “WeatherProof: Arts, Humanities and Sciences Explore the Environment,” spearheaded by five programs at Brown to “weave across barriers to examine environmental issues with a multidisciplinary lens,” The Herald previously <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/04/weatherproof-explores-climate-change-multidisciplinary-lens/">reported.</a> Their focus is not only about visual pleasure, but seeks a more profound impact, leading students to see and contemplate vital issues facing the community. It also shows that art is often multidisciplinary and can have a significant impact in the sciences, environmental justice campaigns and much more. With students contributing to public art through multidisciplinary projects centered on the issues most important to them, they can create art that is impactful and pertinent to the Brown community.</p>
<p class="p2">Art does not need to be the next “Mona Lisa” to encourage discussion or act as a rallying point for students, either. At the least, “Blueno,” the 23-foot blue teddy bear plopped onto Ruth Simmons Quad, has been a point of commonality among all Brown students. Even strangers on campus can safely ask “How do you feel about Blueno?” and expect an opinion and discussion. The same goes for “Ideas of Stone,” the ersatz tree next to the real ones on the Main Green. Even unpopular art serves a purpose on campus.</p>
<p class="p2">Not all public art needs to be by a renowned author. Our students are talented and well-trained and we should view their work with the confidence that it will contribute positively not only to our campus, but also to a wider community. If art is meant not only to adorn, but to foster creative thought and conversation, should we not look to encourage the greatest contribution from our own students? Is this not the essence of a Brown college experience?</p>

		<title>Aman &#039;20: What constitutes acceptable discourse?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think most Brown students agree that while everyone is entitled to an opinion, not everyone is entitled to a platform to present those opinions; when we create space for certain people and groups to speak, we implicitly give their ideas some minimum level of legitimacy. To be clear, by inviting someone to speak, we are not necessarily endorsing their ideas or agreeing with them, but we are agreeing that they have something of value to say. Therefore, like many on this campus, I believe that Brown should not invite trolls like Milo Yiannopoulos, or white supremacist “academics” like Charles Murray to speak, as their opinions are truly abhorrent. Yet we absolutely cannot apply this argument blindly to everyone we disagree with, and instead must foster a healthy and robust debate about where we draw the line on acceptable discourse. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Last Friday, The Herald published an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/06/froid-21-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-irresponsible/">op-ed</a> by Michael Froid ’21 arguing that Jeb Bush’s opinions were so out of line, so indefensible, that he does not deserve a platform to speak at Brown. In response, Mark Liang ’19 wrote a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/09/liang-19-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-responsible/">column</a> published last Monday, arguing that as a major presidential candidate, Jeb Bush is well within the lines of mainstream American discourse, and his views, though not popular at Brown, are widely shared throughout America. At the end of the day, completely dismissing Bush’s views as unworthy of discussion, as outside the realm of debate, weakens our education and undermines our ability to effect positive change in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, deciding which individuals are worthy of speaking at Brown is not always an easy, clear-cut exercise. For example, what if President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence were invited to speak at Brown? I don’t have an immediate answer. As such, I would like to start a discussion and begin to build a framework to help us, as a community, determine the parameters of acceptable discourse. To do so, we must answer two fundamental questions: What value does a potential speaker bring to the table, and how should our community’s values inform the sorts of views we seek out?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To answer the first question, we must consider why we invite guest speakers in the first place. Essentially, how can guest speakers contribute to our education? Generally, guest speakers are able to share personal experiences and new perspectives that we cannot readily find in the library, on the internet or from our professors. This includes visiting professors presenting fresh research and new ideas, professionals at the top of their fields or those with unusual professional and life experiences — like running for president. Froid maintained that Bush doesn’t have anything valuable to say, as “Someone who will mislead the public about the facts surrounding the climate … should not be treated as a credible source of information on other subjects either.” While speakers should ideally have an understanding of basic facts, this isn’t actually a prerequisite. Instead, we must consider what speakers can teach us that we won’t easily find somewhere else at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Secondly, we must consider how our University’s values should influence the types of speakers we choose to host. To be clear, by “University’s values” I do not mean values that the majority of people at Brown share. Instead, these are values that Brown has developed over time as a community — that we, as students, accepted when we decided to come here. The University’s primary objective, as articulated in its <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/mission">mission statement</a>, “is to serve the community, the nation, and the world by discovering, communicating, and preserving knowledge and understanding in a spirit of free inquiry.” Further evidence of Brown’s values can be found within the University’s <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/sites/brown.edu.academics.college.degree/files/uploads/Lib-Learning-Goals_0.pdf">Liberal Learning goals</a>, which include concrete skills like speaking, writing and scientific inquiry, as well as more abstract goals like embracing diversity and engaging with our communities. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University’s goals and values aren’t exclusive to one political party or ideology, and if we decide they are, we are severely limiting our education. Inherent to the values held by the University are respect and empathy — the belief that, while there is no room for hateful ideas on this campus, we have a responsibility to listen to others and engage with the world around us. If our goal is ultimately to “serve the community, the nation and the world,” we must understand and ultimately be able to work with people who hold opinions and viewpoints drastically different from our own. Therefore, exposure to a vast array of perspectives is a crucial aspect of an effective education, even if it sometimes makes us uncomfortable. Already, Brown tends to present primarily liberal ideas: A recent study by the SPEAK student coalition revealed that <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/05/study-finds-most-hosted-speakers-lean-left-politically/">94.5 percent</a> of hosted speakers at Brown lean left. And while we should absolutely think critically about whose views we legitimize when inviting guest speakers, if we dismiss mainstream views on the right as completely unjustifiable and illegitimate, we are further distancing our education from reality. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When done right, inviting a diverse selection of guest speakers to campus has the potential to add significant value to our education. Yet the current firestorm surrounding Bush’s impending speech has exposed a lack of clear and accepted standards for inviting speakers to Brown. Going forward, we must continue to have deliberate, honest and inclusive conversations to further clarify our University’s values and how guest speakers can contribute to our education. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In recent weeks, ideological diversity has become a major topic of discussion on campus. The Herald has certainly facilitated this larger discussion, publishing a wide range of op-eds about free speech, the SPEAK coalition and Jeb Bush’s upcoming lecture. These articles all touch on the idea of ideological diversity and the purpose of bringing speakers to campus who may not necessarily align with student opinion. In reading my peers’ thoughts, I have ultimately found myself wondering: What kind of opinions are productive and worthwhile to a scholarly community like Brown? To be clear, I’m not making an argument for or against inviting Bush to speak at Brown; this particular case has already been heavily discussed. I am, however, seeking to raise the broader question of how a scholarly community should go about identifying what kinds of opinions and debates it should host.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ideological diversity is important, yes. And by listening to differing viewpoints, we can start to make progress. But we must also be cognizant of what kinds of differing opinions foster productive discourse and what kinds simply run on hate and marginalize vulnerable populations. Inviting speakers to campus for the sole purpose of diversifying thought is not enough. We must go through the more laborious task of thinking about how a different perspective may prove productive and what value can come from bringing a new view into our academic community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Rebecca Aman ’20 noted in an April 13 column entitled “What constitutes acceptable discourse?”, we should first consider the educational value of the speakers the University invites to campus. These speakers must have clearly defined, relevant approaches to policy, social issues and politics. And the ideas presented by those coming to campus in the name of ideological diversity need not be a perfect reflection of the University’s or student body’s values. This discord is actually productive: We can derive educational value from the people we disagree with. Encountering different perspectives is a great learning opportunity, and since we live in an academic community, it is important for us to maximize opportunities to understand unfamiliar points of view and think critically. Being able to look at the world through different lenses enriches our education as students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But what speakers can teach us is only half of the equation. We must also consider the discursive, applied value of speakers — their capacity to provoke thought, stimulate important conversations and provide students with opportunities to engage with the content of their speech through campus discourse. We’ve had the privilege of hearing from amazing people this past year, and what makes these people so amazing is, in part, their ability to make audiences think critically and engage with one another on various topics. When Cornel West came to campus last month, for example, his words were powerful in their own right. But, for me, the value of his words also came from the sustained discussions of everything he said that I had with my friends in the Ivy Room that evening, and even this past week at the bookstore coffee shop. The staying power of West’s talk — and how long speakers’ ideas endure in the work that we do as students — might serve as a fruitful measure for what speakers from various fields and backgrounds can be expected to contribute with their presence on campus. Students should be able to take what they’ve learned from any given talk and turn it into something meaningful for themselves. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While coming up with expectations for the kinds of voices we invite to campus and measuring the educational and discursive value of speakers might seem straightforward, to think about what views might not be of use on campus is more difficult. There’s a lot of gray area when it comes to trying to identify what ideas are acceptable and unacceptable. On one level, speakers ought to meet the criteria of the funds and lectures that sponsor their invitation. As a practical matter, whether or not Bush, a former governor of Florida who lacks any foreign policy experience, can carry out the purpose of the Stephen A. Ogden Jr. ’60 Memorial Lecture on International Affairs is up for debate. In separate articles published in The Herald opinions section, Michael Froid ’21 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/06/froid-21-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-irresponsible/">argued</a> that the decision to award Bush “a prestigious lecture” in international affairs makes little sense given his inexperience, while Mark Liang ’19 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/09/liang-19-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-responsible/">called</a> Froid’s criticism “partisan,” noting that “Having direct experience in the State Department or equivalent is obviously not a requisite” to give the Ogden Memorial lecture.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Qualifications aside, however, there remains the larger tension around whether or not Bush provides any substantive value to our community. While Bush might meet some of the audience’s standards for making a valuable contribution to our campus, for others, inviting him to speak is reprehensible, and his views fall outside of what they see as useful — or even safe — for students. In a lot of cases, it is hard to determine if a speaker’s views harm students and deserve to be excluded from campus, or if they constitute a meaningful learning opportunity that should be sought out. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The question of who should get the final say in deeming an opinion or way of thinking productive is nearly impossible to answer. But it is because this question is so difficult to answer that it is crucial that we think long and hard about the value that guest speakers — and differing views in broader forms, like the composition of faculty — provide to our community. Aman started this process, and I’ve tried to advance it here, though by no means is my set of expectations perfect. Going forward, we, as a community, must be willing to intentionally, collectively and conscientiously think about guest speakers, guest lecturers and their effect on campus discourse and our education. Just because this task is difficult and far from clear-cut does not mean it should not be taken up. In fact, it is because it is so difficult — and so worthwhile for the University and for our education — that we must embrace this challenge.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the University established need-blind admissions policies in 2002 and then in December 2017 announced the elimination of loans from undergraduate financial aid packages, it joined many of its peer institutions in making a profound statement to the world that a student’s ability to pay should never keep them from obtaining a first-rate education. While the changes thus far are deeply consequential, there are still more reforms Brown needs to make if it truly wishes to be a place that any student, no matter their income level, can comfortably attend. A critical next step is for the University to expand access to affordable dining services for all students during spring break.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown Dining Services does not allow students to utilize their regular meal plan during the break, but instead requires them to purchase a separate plan, which costs $288, to eat on campus during break. Students can, however, qualify to receive the plan gratuit, through an emergency fund program for students “with exceptionally high demonstrated financial need,” according to <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/financial-advising/e-gap-funds">UFunds</a>. Unfortunately, the threshold of eligibility for this program is not public information. For the many who don’t quite fall into this category but still struggle to make ends meet — particularly when extraneous costs arise — paying for food over spring break is an unreasonable burden, particularly at a university that prides itself on being accessible.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s important to acknowledge that for many, spring break is perceived as an exercise in cutting loose. It’s a time when many students leave campus, and unlike winter and Thanksgiving breaks, where family is a focus, spring break is culturally associated with heading somewhere tropical or abroad, largely for the purpose of drinking too much, eating too much and forgetting entirely about the responsibilities of college. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is a large segment of the Brown student body, though, for whom spring break is more stressful than it is sophomoric. For those students who can’t quite afford to leave campus on vacation, the added burden of being unable to use one’s regular meal plan at a dining hall that is nonetheless open during break is quite significant. A small adjustment to current University dining services policy could translate into huge stress relief for students who do find themselves in this situation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As with any proposal involving the expansion of services for students, it’s understandable for administrators — even those who are particularly sensitive to students’ financial concerns — to be wary of the costs associated with continuing dining services through spring break. Luckily, programs at peer institutions provide templates for us to consider when it comes to affordability.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, dining at the Ratty during spring break costs $10.66 per meal and has to be purchased within a full set of meals for the spring break week, which is incredibly cost prohibitive. If the University does not want to go so far as to allow students to use their regular swipes during break, a more affordable feature could be a system in which students are able to purchase whatever number of meals they want for the week, at a more affordable price.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yale introduced a similar <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/04/02/spring-break-plan-serves-hundreds-of-students/">program</a> in 2013, which allows students to pre-purchase individual meals at $7 each to use at any time during the break. This would be a much more gracious option for the University to provide, because it allows students to selectively decide how many prepared meals they are willing to pay for each day and at a much lower cost per meal. But, if Brown were to allow students to swipe in on their regular plan, it would be following peer institutions who currently do the same and have found a way to make it cost feasible, like the <a href="https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2018/04/03/food-insecurity-does-not-go-on-spring-break-neither-should-quest-for-solutions/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> and the <a href="http://hospitality.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Dine_on_Spring_break_Schedule_18-1.pdf">University of Southern California</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Furthermore, while break may accentuate the issue of food insecurity on college campuses, it is by no means the only moment each year that some students will face food insecurity. If anything, Brown’s spring break dining services just serve as a critical place for us to start considering the ways in which students at Brown could be affected by food insecurity on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nationally, according to a survey of 40,000 college students, 36 percent of respondents reported experiencing food insecurity at some point this school year. Many students reported being unable to buy a required textbook, being unable to focus in class, missing class or even dropping a class altogether as a result of being hungry. Moreover, the huge toll on one’s mental health cannot be ignored — it likely feels stressful and shameful to be unable to afford sufficient food, particularly in an environment where many students are quite privileged with the necessary resources to get by comfortably.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As an educational institution, we are compelled to acknowledge the profound effect that food can have on one’s ability to be academically successful. As a community that holds itself to a high academic standard, we must realize our obligation to ensure every student has sufficient access to food so that they are set up with the best opportunity to reap the most of their time here.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Schools like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thefoodbankatcolumbia/">Columbia</a> and the <a href="https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/food/foodassist/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> have created campus food banks that allow students who need a little extra food assistance to take dietary staples at any time during the school year at no cost. These banks even make a point of reaching out and advertising to students about this option during the break. Even more comprehensively, the University of Wisconsin-Madison provides students with a list on their main food website of all available free food options around campus — including a hot dinner prepared for students to enjoy for free every Tuesday night using surplus dining hall ingredients. The introduction of even just one of these services could make a huge difference in the lives of many students in our community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As an institution, Brown already commits itself to equality of access to a premier education. The University has stated to the world that it is devoted to making itself a place where lower income students can feasibly come for their college education. It’s unfair, frankly, to accept students, promising each one tuition aid tailored to their specific financial needs, without also affording every single student adequate access to food for every single day of their time here. Anything less is a false promise.</span></p>

		<title>Flynn &#039;20: Herald, employ the Oxford comma</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Anyone who has written for the Brown Daily Herald has had to put up with the stain of barbarism that persists in its style guide. I am referring to the rule that prohibits the use of the Oxford comma, or the serial comma, which is the comma placed before the coordinating conjunction in a series of three or more terms. In the list, for example, “the United States, France, and China,” the Oxford comma is the last one before the “and.” This comma usually lends itself to resolving egregious ambiguity. It is a wonder, then, why the style guide of The Herald nonetheless strictly enforces a rule to no other effect than to make writing more ambiguous. The reasons turn out to be a dogmatic appeal to authority and a desire to fit in with major news publications. The Herald has indulged this practice for too long and must reform it hereafter.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the publishing world there is a great divide in the use of the Oxford comma, which is often the subject of vehement and bitter controversy. Lynne Truss, in her style guide “Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves,” comments that “There are people who embrace the Oxford comma, and people who don’t, and I’ll just say this: Never get between these people when drink has been taken.” Oxford University Press, most American book publishers and many American style guides recommend its use. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/holy-writ">“Comma Queen” Mary Norris</a> of The New Yorker, which is famous for its rigorous copy editing, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/a-few-words-about-that-ten-million-dollar-serial-comma">calls the Oxford comma</a> “a bulwark against barbarianism.” On the other hand, most British publishers, most American newspapers — such as The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times — and the widely used Associated Press Stylebook recommend against its use, according to Steven Pinker’s book, “The Sense of Style.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Times <a href="https://afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/faqs-on-style-2/?mtrref=undefined&amp;login=email&amp;auth=login-email">forbids the Oxford comma</a> except in cases “where a sentence would be awkward or confusing without it,” and justifies the omission by appealing to what news writing has “traditionally” done, without fully understanding the reasoning behind that tradition: “perhaps seeking a more rapid feeling in the prose, or perhaps to save time and effort in the old days of manual typesetting.” The Herald uses the AP Stylebook as its default style guide, which most professional newspapers also use. It wants to come off as professional, though it does not employ the same nuance that the Times does in its policy. As a copy editor of three semesters, I not once have witnessed an intentional exception to the rule for clarity’s sake.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the omission of the Oxford comma is often problematic. Take these two examples, which I’ve drawn from “The Sense of Style” and the <a href="http://www.oxbridgeediting.co.uk/blog/oxbridge-editing-guide-oxford-comma/">Oxbridge Proofreading and Editing Resource Blog</a>: (1) “He enjoyed his farm, conversations with his wife and his horse,” and (2) “Highlights of Peter Ustinov’s global tour include encounters with Nelson Mandela, an 800-year-old demigod and a dildo collector.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Also consider these two examples from recent articles in The Herald. <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/05/art-exhibit-explores-stories-along-u-s-mexico-border/">One article describes</a> an art exhibit featuring objects left by people crossing the Mexican-American border, and it includes the following sentence: “These objects include backpacks, water bottles, clothes and pieces of fabric worn by people around their shoes to conceal their footprints, the artist added.” Because there is no comma after “clothes,” the sentence at first read seems to say that it was both the “clothes” and the “pieces of fabric” that people wore around their shoes. It is only upon reaching the end of the sentence that the reader realizes that the participial phrase cannot be modifying “clothes.” This causes the reader to pause in confusion and then to go back to reread the sentence. <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/12/evans-molina-fernandez-composes-vibrant-paintings/">Another article profiles</a> an artist: “As an adult, he began to forge his path as a creative through multiple forms of expression, including designing sets for teleplays, restoring historical sites around Cuba, studying cinematography and scriptwriting as well as directing a performance art group, he said.” Because there is no comma after “cinematography,” it is ambiguous whether the artist was actually scriptwriting or was simply studying scriptwriting — a significant difference.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Opponents of the Oxford comma might claim that its omission makes the prose smoother and brisker. Because commas cause the reader to pause by signaling a separation of ideas, they say, the use of all commas should be minimal. But this claim is mistaken. In a series of three or more terms, the pauses that commas produce are necessary, since they allow the reader to distinguish intuitively and fluidly among those terms. Without a pause before the last term, the reader, at first read, does not distinguish intuitively the last term from the previous term in the series. Thus the lack of a pause often yields confusion and disrupts the flow of the prose.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anecdotally, in my time at The Herald, virtually every copy editor to whom I have spoken about this rule has expressed the same loathing for it that I feel. Many other writers and editors there have also expressed utter contempt for being forced to adhere to it. These objections are not merely trivial complaints from exhausted copy editors — the omission of the Oxford comma can have real-world consequences. The faulty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/oxford-comma-maine.html">omission of the Oxford comma once cost</a> Oakhurst Dairy in Portland, Maine, $5 million in settlements, when a court found Maine law governing overtime pay ambiguous precisely because of the lack of an Oxford comma.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those rare individuals who claim to like the excision of the Oxford comma have justified their position not on the basis of any merits of the rule, but on the basis that this is the way it has been done for a long time and the way the Times does it. But these are not good reasons. The AP Stylebook’s rule against the use of the Oxford comma is based on a dogmatic appeal to tradition; The Herald’s adoption of that rule is based on a dogmatic appeal to authority. We are at a point in history, grounded in the ideals of the Enlightenment, when dogma, authority and tradition are no longer viable arguments for anything — reason and rationality must trump those more invidious forces. Brown, moreover, prides itself in producing free thinkers who reject appeals to the established way of doing things. For the sake of the comprehension of its readers and the sanity of its writers, and for the sake of progress, The Herald must lead the way in eliminating this rule from its style guide and allowing the Oxford comma.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Turn on any cable news channel, and you are likely to be inundated with punditry. This has always been a staple of news coverage but has especially increased since the 2016 election. The structure of election cycles is conducive to punditry — there is no true referendum for an incorrect position until the actual election night. A ​Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2016/06/02/pundits/?utm_term=.9e201fec79ed">article</a>​ neatly encapsulated the paradoxical nature of punditry dominating cable news: “The leading news networks — CNN, Fox, MSNBC — don’t report the news as much as they talk and speculate endlessly about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The appetite for incessant punditry was realized during the 2016 election, and the factors that enabled it have persisted into the Trump presidency. There are just as many narratives, personal dramas and unverifiable predictions to make as there were during the election cycle — unsurprisingly, this has resulted in similarly ubiquitous punditry, further degrading these ostensibly informative news channels. One distinct feature of this discussion-dominated coverage, however, is how much the panel debates on cable news have come to resemble those on sports talk shows. Befitting our partisan moment, political squabbling now imitates discussion of sports.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In both aesthetic style and rhetorical manner, the similarities are striking. This is by design — CNN President Jeff Zucker has spoken explicitly about his desire to incorporate elements of ESPN’s programming into CNN’s. “The idea that politics is sport is undeniable,” Zucker said ​in a 2017 interview​. “We understood that and approached it that way.” He instituted changes at CNN with the direct goal of imitating ESPN’s format. ESPN has “College GameDay,” where it puts a live set outside a stadium, with plenty of fans in the background. Under Zucker’s direction, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/magazine/cnn-had-a-problem-donald-trump-solved-it.html">CNN built similar “pregame sets”</a> outside debate halls, ornamented with raucous crowds. The takeaway, logically, is to equate a presidential debate with a college football game — both are events with fans for both sides eagerly waiting outside while a zero-sum competition ensues inside. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While the changing nature of pre-debate coverage reveals ESPN’s influence on CNN, the implications may seem fairly narrow, given that debates are limited to a presidential campaign cycle. It is in the shift toward daytime punditry where the influence of ESPN’s programming has found far more traction. This is hardly unique to CNN; as punditry increasingly becomes the cable news norm, nearly all panels seem to imitate the sets of ESPN’s talk shows, such as “First Take.” There is a moderator affixed to the center of the table, and he or she is symmetrically flanked by opposing pundits, ready to face off in loud disagreement. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is not surprising that cable news, like ESPN, aims to foster arguments. These often make for television spectacle and draw even more eyeballs when circulated online. But the problems with covering politics like sports are manifold. Firstly, the focus of pundits is quite removed from the functional aspects of governance and more about juicy television storylines. They concentrate on battle lines and warring characters rather than actual policy issues; the Trump White House and its staffing turnstile is perfect for this coverage environment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Where this is most problematic is in regard to discussion of policy. When the locus does move to a piece of legislation, discussion of it is framed in the structure of narratives and of “winning and losing.” Just as Stephen A. Smith opines on whether a team will win or lose a particular game, pundits debate whether Democrats won or lost on a particular bill. This fails to edify the viewing audience about specific policy and constrains the significance of a law to the political realm. When covering the attempts to repeal Obamacare this summer, pundits spoke in zero-sum political terms rather than focusing on the functional aspects of the bill, which would have caused around 20 million people to lose health insurance. Sports-style punditry often fails to cover policy, and when it does, it depicts legislation as a partisan tug-of-war — thus ignoring the tangible ramifications of the bills themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The idea of applying the “politics as sport” mantra to cable news is most problematic because it intuitively pits two parties against one another. Pundits are often paid partisans with a clear agenda despite appearing on the show under the guise of relative objectivity. Those who become regulars on a show are simply playing a role: A pundit hired as a Trump supporter will always take that side of the argument — they will be the reliable Trump apologist while the rest of the panel condemns him. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What the viewer gets, then, is political coverage in the most tribally structured way. This is even done visually, with the panels often being bifurcated by the moderator, providing viewers with a visual cue that lets them know which team the pundits are on. Once these arguments naturally devolve into shouting matches, the viewer knows who to root for and ignores points from the other side; cable news panels end up validating and reinforcing existing views.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ultimately, the shift toward ESPN-stylized news coverage exacerbates political tribalism, fails to inform the viewer and depicts the political process as a team sport with winners and losers. The ever-present punditry across the cable news channels renders them useless as vehicles of information; they are performances, with political commentary playing a tangential role.</span></p>

		<title>Johnson &#039;20: Barriers to RISD courses restrict academic freedom</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 2016-2017 school year, while 376 Rhode Island School of Design students were registered for at least one course at Brown in the fall or spring semester, only 155 Brown students were <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-research/factbook/enrollment">cross-registered</a> at RISD. While there was an increase in RISD students taking Brown courses between 2015-2016 and 2016-2017, there was about a 22 percent decrease in Brown students in RISD classes in the same period. One possible reason is that the process of cross-registration can make it restrictive for Brown students to take courses at RISD. Even though Brown promotes academic freedom and exploration in its philosophy, there are many barriers that can prevent Brown students from taking classes at RISD and therefore restrict their ability to go outside their comfort zone in academics and meet people with different perspectives. </span></p>
<p class="p2">There is a plethora of art classes at Brown that can stimulate a student’s creativity; however, taking at least one course at an art school like RISD can also be a fulfilling part of a student’s academic journey. While Brown does offer its students various art classes and equipment, RISD has a specific set of studios, equipment and facilities for each art discipline that allows every student to experiment more freely and develop new techniques to approach <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/10/09/cross-registration-rises-among-brown-risd-students/">art projects</a>. In addition, the atmosphere at RISD is different from that at Brown. Brown students are unique since many of us have diverse interests and are passionate about the academics and extracurriculars we pursue. However, taking a course where nearly all students are passionate about their art discipline can make you feel more creative and productive. Thanks to RISD’s inclusive environment and discussions of how to push the boundaries on art projects, Brown students can gain more insight on how to represent their perspective in an unfamiliar way.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As many of us know, Brown’s academic philosophy challenges students to develop their own curriculum in order to be open to new people, ideas and experiences. This openness helps students make the most of the freedom that they have in their education and broaden their perspectives on the world. A student taking classes at RISD lives out Brown’s philosophy by pursuing a different experience. However, there are a few barriers that prevent some Brown students from pursuing this opportunity. For one, a prerequisite to taking a RISD course is taking VISA 0100: “Studio Foundation,” an introductory studio art course. However, this course usually has between five and 10 sections, most capped at 20 students, with a random lottery that students must enter in order to get into the class. Some students can waive this</span> requirement by successfully completing one or two years of college-level art <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/visual-art/faqs">courses in high school</a>. However, this restricts students who may not have attended a school with an intense art program or those who may not have had the resources to pursue college-level art courses and develop a portfolio during their time in high school. Furthermore, most RISD courses have fees that students must pay up front. For example, CER 4028: “Introduction to Ceramics for Design Majors” has a <a href="https://departments.risd.edu/registrar/web/1617cat.pdf">fee</a> of $120. While there are some Brown students who can afford this fee, low-income students may be prevented from taking this class since the expense can be a financial burden.</p>
<p class="p2">Strict prerequisites and entry fees can prevent Brown students from pursuing the opportunity to take a RISD course and, as a result, restrict some of their academic freedom. There are a few things that the Brown administration can do in order to remove these barriers. For one, Brown can provide a dedicated financial grant to cover the fees for RISD courses in order to make them more accessible for low-income students. In addition, if it’s not possible to provide more sections of VISA 0100 in future semesters, Brown should consider providing free workshops in different art fields to help students develop their portfolios. The visual arts newsletter already provides opportunities for students to gain experience; however, workshops can make students get out of their comfort zones and develop more confidence in order to pursue these opportunities and be prepared for RISD courses.</p>

		<title>Savello &#039;18: Rethinking the writing requirement</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/18/rethinking-writing-requirement/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2018 01:57:10 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Brown, the writing requirement is the only academic requirement for students outside of their concentrations. Created with the goal of helping students develop and maintain their writing skills, this requirement mandates that all students take two writing-designated courses during their time at Brown (one during their first two years and one during their second two years) to ensure that all students graduate with writing experience, regardless of their concentration. While this requirement seems almost effortless for humanities concentrators and those who enjoy writing, it is often seen as a burden — or even a cause for concern — for those who are less interested in writing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s not uncommon, for example, for students to openly panic or fret over WRIT courses, especially within STEM fields. Some even opt for the “approved alternative” option available in select departments, which allows them to submit a writing sample instead of completing the second <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/curriculum/writing-requirement">WRIT-designated</a> course. Given that WRIT courses have taken on a reputation for being time-intensive (which, depending on the course, is often unwarranted), it makes sense that busy students would dread taking a writing course and would choose this option instead. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, while allowing students to opt out of their second writing course saves them time and effort in the short term, Brown is ultimately doing these students a disservice in the long term. Not only will these students miss out on the valuable experience of improving their writing skills, but they are also likely to miss out on a potential opportunity to explore a field that is not their own, a loss which goes against Brown’s pillar of academic discovery. After all, submitting a writing sample for course credit is not the same as being in a classroom where you can get continuous, personal feedback over a series of weeks, which is the ultimate goal of WRIT courses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given these disadvantages, I think the biology, applied mathematics and German studies departments<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>should reconsider this alternative option. Two writing courses within four years is not too much to ask of students; in fact, it’s probably not enough to help students fully develop their writing skills. This is not an opportunity students can afford to miss out on. No matter how far removed students’ studies or jobs are from writing, these skills will always be necessary in order to be successful in life, whether in applying to a job or communicating an idea to a colleague.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In addition, students have more options than they think they do when it comes to the WRIT requirement, and should not feel forced to hand in a writing sample as a last resort. Many of the WRIT courses Brown offers are not as writing-intensive as the rumors make them out to be. There are some very time-consuming WRIT courses available, especially in humanities departments. However, students who are not interested in literature or creative writing have the option to take writing courses in other departments, including STEM and the social sciences, which often require less writing. A simple glance at course syllabi will show whether the final paper is four pages or 10, allowing students to make decisions based on their workload needs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Keeping this information in mind, students should realize that the writing requirement was invented to help them, not to hurt them, and that they should do thorough research before opting out of their second WRIT course. Brown offers a wide variety of WRIT courses in areas from mathematics to history to foreign languages, and it would be a waste to give up the chance to work on improving your writing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By removing the approved alternative option, Brown would encourage students to explore the wide range of opportunities available to them and help to reduce the unwarranted fears associated with taking a WRIT course. Being able to work on your writing while in college is a privilege. Once you leave college and enter adulthood, you likely won’t get such an opportunity again. </span></p>

		<title>Mulligan &#039;19: Don’t talk down to millennials</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A <a href="http://perspectives.acct.org/stories/still-hungry-and-homeless-in-college">2018 report</a> from Temple University and the Wisconsin Harvesting Opportunities for Postsecondary Education Lab suggests that food insecurity is a much larger issue on college campuses than previously thought, affecting 42 percent of community college students and 36 percent of four-year college students. In a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/13/opinion-college-students-hungry-lazy/33810337/">USA Today op-ed</a>, libertarian commentator James Bovard provides a vastly different view, summed up in the article’s title: “College Students Aren’t Hungry, They’re Lazy.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I could spend this piece sharing stories that I’ve seen and heard about on campus, about students whose main source of meals is the free swipes at the end of their shifts with Brown University Dining Services, or students who seek out free food or borrowed meal credits because they wouldn’t be able to eat otherwise. But that’s anecdotal evidence, easily hand-waved away, and for the purpose of this piece, it doesn’t really matter if 9 percent or 99 percent of college students have difficulty accessing regular meals. Instead, what I want to look at is the condescending tone that Bovard adopts throughout his piece, a tone reminiscent of the 2017 moment when an Australian millionaire <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/15/news/millennials-home-buying-avocado-toast/index.html">identified avocado toast and coffee</a> as the source of millennials’ money woes. The patronizing rhetoric that some older commentators like Bovard apply when discussing millennial and Generation Z students makes it difficult to facilitate intergenerational communication, ultimately creating yet another rift in our deeply polarized political climate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bovard suggests that college students are unable to accurately identify our problems. Survey respondents were asked “whether they feared ‘food would run out before (they) got money to buy more,’ or if they “ever eat less than (they) felt (they) should because there wasn’t enough money for food?’” to which Bovard responds, “Redefining hunger as abstaining from second servings makes for a push-button crisis.” In likening the conservative consumption of food to just choosing not to have a second serving, Bovard perpetuates the notion that younger generations exaggerate our problems: Our issue isn’t that we don’t have enough food; it’s that we make too big a deal about the basic human need of wanting to not be hungry. This tactic is an attempt to undermine students when they identify problems that might not be apparent to those outside of the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Continuing in this vein, Bovard uses rhetorical questions to ridicule the study’s findings, instead of performing any sort of journalistic investigation into the claims: “The study asserts that 26 percent of students with a college meal plan are ‘food insecure.’ Did they oversleep and miss breakfast?” Bovard chooses to ignore possibilities like students having to purchase an insufficient meal plan because a larger plan would be too expensive. Instead of challenging the study’s findings, he tries to use sarcasm like a late-night talk show host, assuming that his audience will agree with him instead of looking deeply at the study’s claims.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">He again chooses a reactionary approach when he mocks the study’s finding that around 50 percent of Pell Grant recipients qualify as food-insecure: “Apparently, no matter how many handouts government provides, students still cannot be expected or trusted to feed themselves.” However, Pell Grants are provided only to students with “exceptional financial need,” according to the <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/pell">Department of Education</a>, and they are maxed out at $6,095. In addition, students who need Pell Grants likely have to think about other expenses, like housing, textbooks and school supplies. By trying to frame the situation as one of financial irresponsibility, Bovard uses the same tactic as in the aforementioned avocado toast incident, acting as though money problems are solely individual issues, not the result of larger systems of inequality. This argument again presents millennials and the generations after them as demanding handouts to correct for their own mistakes, ignoring the bigger picture in which a $6,095, at most, grant can’t cover both food and all other academic expenses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bovard attempts to dismantle the study through various angles in his op-ed, including a particularly interesting moment when he attempts to equate correlation with causality in order to question the study’s observation that LGBTQ+ students are at a greater risk of food insecurity than their heterosexual and/or cisgender peers. He also tries to use rising obesity rates to undermine the possibility of food insecurity — as though there isn’t a <a href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/60/11/2667">high association</a> between poverty and obesity, which suggests that the simultaneous rise of weight gain and food insecurity on college campuses could be linked. Both of these statements once again rely on the readers to just accept millennial stereotypes instead of thinking critically about the claims presented.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second-to-last paragraph drives home the point of how Bovard’s piece is part of the larger dialogue of older commentators attempting to undermine younger ones: “The Post noted in 2012 that ‘the typical student today spends 27 hours a week in study and class time, roughly the same time commitment expected of students in a modern full-day kindergarten.’ But expecting students to use free time to get a job to feed themselves is beyond the pale.” The arrogant and exaggerated tone he uses when analyzing a statistic with virtually no relevance to his larger claim indicates a sense of superiority on Bovard’s part; he holds the answer — get a job! — that the hungry college student lacks. Never mind the fact that 25 percent of full-time students also work full-time, or that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/29/more-college-students-are-working-while-studying.html">80 percent</a> of college students work at all. Bovard expects his reader to agree that college students are only as busy as kindergarteners, and above all, that we’re lazy to the point where we would choose hunger over employment. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Is food insecurity a problem on college campuses? Probably. But the larger problem that Bovard’s piece demonstrates is the continued portrayal of younger generations as entitled and demanding, a portrayal that relies on the assumption that the reader won’t critically examine baseless claims. As long as older writers continue to blast younger generations as “narcissistic” and “stunted” — as one in Time magazine recently did — there can be no hope for honest and open communication across generations. And in today’s politically tumultuous world, those conversations are sorely needed.</span></p>

		<title>Cardoso ’19: After Marielle Franco&#039;s death, Brazil can no longer ignore its racism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Abdias do Nascimento once famously noted, Brazil has the largest African population of any country in the world besides Nigeria. As of 2010, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/17/brazil-census-african-brazilians-majority">97 million Brazilians</a> — 50.7 percent of the country’s population — identify as black or mixed-race. Over the course of the 20th century, racial diversity — particularly among people of European, African and indigenous origin — became a dominant theme in the country’s social consciousness. By the end of the 20th century, a national mythology had emerged around Brazil’s unique multiracial development. Brazil was, as Gilberto Freyre famously commented (though he did not coin the phrase), a “racial democracy.” That is, through generations of coexistence, Brazilians learned to live in a state of racial co-harmony. So how did Brazil — the only former European colony in South America to be ruled by the royal family of its colonizer following independence and the last state in the Americas to outlaw slavery — become a paragon of racial tolerance? Simply put, it didn’t.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fast forward to March 2018. Marielle Franco, an openly lesbian Afro-Brazilian councilwoman in Rio de Janeiro, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/28/597750735/u-n-calls-for-investigation-into-assassination-of-black-activist-in-brazil">was assassinated</a>, along with her driver. Throughout her public life, Franco had been critical of Rio de Janeiro’s approach to managing crime in the city’s favelas and the government’s indifference to the poverty of black or mixed-race Brazilians who live in urban centers. Most recently, she had been an outspoken opponent of the federal government’s decision to deploy the military to control crime in the predominantly black favelas of the city. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Her supporters have claimed that her murder was an act of “black genocide” perpetrated by members of the military, eager to silence an especially vocal critic. Yet while her murder actually remains unsolved, there is a kernel of truth in her supporters’ suspicion: Brazil is a society deeply divided by race. Franco’s assassination — in bringing attention to the brutal tactics of the federal military against the predominantly black favelas, her life’s work challenging institutional racism and even the suspicious circumstances surrounding her death — has challenged the idea of racial democracy publicly in a way that it has not been in decades. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For instance, let’s examine one crucial pillar of the myth of racial democracy: Inequality in Brazil exists along class, not racial, lines. Many Brazilians, including many black and mixed-race Brazilians, when challenged, are quick to point to a number of wealthy or successful Afro-Brazilians as proof that social mobility can transcend racial limitations. Yet this is not true. On average, white Brazilian men make approximately 50 percent more than black Brazilian men, according to one study. When one controls for education, experience and labor market characteristics, race continues to <a href="http://www20.iadb.org/intal/catalogo/PE/2009/03803.pdf">strongly influence wage disparities</a>. Similarly, despite making up 51 percent of the population, black and mixed-race Brazilians <a href="https://blackwomenofbrazil.co/2012/11/05/the-under-representation-of-blacks-in-brazils-congress/">make up only 8.5 percent</a> of deputies to the House of Deputies, the lower house of Brazil’s national legislature. And if black or mixed-race Brazilians are underrepresented in politics, they are overrepresented in prisons: <a href="http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-politics/brazil-has-worlds-third-largest-prison-population/">64 percent</a> of the country’s prison population is black. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Franco, and many others, have been critical of these trends in Brazilian politics, the country has largely been unable to have serious discussions about race due to the mythology of racial harmony that made criticism of institutional racism seem unpatriotic or even subversive. Fortunately, these discussions are beginning to take place in <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/mariosergioconti/2018/03/voz-negra-mascaras-brancas.shtml">mainstream forums</a>. Of course, none of this is to say that many Brazilians were not critical of institutional racism and the illusion of “racial democracy” since the term gained popularity in the beginning of the 20th century. Rather, it is to say that mainstream and international attention given to Franco’s death is beginning to neuter claims of racial democracy as an acceptable refrain when debating racism in Brazil. Brazil can and should work toward the realization of the so-called “fable of the three races.” But to do so, it must continue the process of recognizing that it is still just a fable. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It once seemed an impossible dream, but spring has finally come to Providence. As predictable as daffodils, students all over campus are populating every green space available to soak up the long-overdue rays of sunshine, ensuring that this week’s prospective student visitors for A Day on College Hill, unlike last week’s, are given the full picture of the ideal college experience — music playing, frisbees flying, hammocks hanging from trees. And while everyone may have different preferences when it comes to the weather, it really does seem that days like these — days of rebirth and reawakening — make us better people. We are friendlier and happier. Our interactions are better: What might have been a rushed smile at a friend as you both hurry to the nearest indoor library or dining hall becomes a real conversation. We gather together for more events, stop at things that look interesting, become more spontaneous. As the days get longer, they get more complete, as the beckoning spring sun imbues us with the energy and desire to make the most of each.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is, therefore, an unfortunate feature of the academic calendar that too many of these magical spring days are only observed, longingly, through a library window. The looming threats of exams and final papers are compounded by the almost physical difficulty of sitting inside on a beautiful day long enough to prepare for them. And unless you’re staying for Senior Week, your last days of the semester are likely to be a harried balancing act between the desire to sit surrounded by friends on the Main Green and nagging anxiety over that half-written paper.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yes, we are in college to learn, not to frolic in the sunshine. And it would take a radical reshaping of either the learning process or meteorology to hold our cumulative spring exams in less alluring weather. But short of transferring to schools in magical climates with more than 10 nice days in a semester, we should have options that allow us to cherish these days without feeling constantly bogged down by our workloads. Some professors, aware of the fact that time seems to race by after spring break, give students the option to turn in major assignments at any point during the semester. While this is logistically not feasible for the curricula in many classes, offering multiple major assignments to take the weight off of the final exam can also make the end-of-year crunch more manageable. However, while academic changes may be hard to come by, changes in our mindsets and behaviors can also have a powerful effect when it comes to living the last month of the semester to the fullest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Reading period and finals and the weeks leading up to them can be the most stressful times of the year, particularly when concerns about internships, jobs or moving to another city are thrown into the mix. It’s easy to let that stress consume us and feel like we’re missing out on important chances to deepen friendships and explore Providence at its best, or simply to relax and take a break. When that happens, taking the time to get fresh air — if only to take a quick walk or eat a meal outdoors — can boost motivation and energy to the point that you don’t have to feel guilty about the time spent relaxing. But over the next few weeks, the most valuable approach that I’ve identified for maximizing the good moments while getting everything done is to live each moment with intention. Ensure that you’re dedicated to working when you’ve set aside other things to get work done, and commit to fully enjoying the rest of your time. This is bigger than “productive procrastination” or self-care. It is a reminder that these days, the days that stir us to enjoy our friendships and our beautiful campus and forget about everything else, can break us out of our normal, work-driven routines, and that is a good thing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And if all else fails, as my roommate helpfully contributed, just do all your work at night. I take no responsibility for how that works out for you.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As I sit down to write, the Boston Red Sox have just been no-hit by Sean Manaea of the Oakland Athletics. But the setback is minimal. The Red Sox are still 17-4: They have the best record in baseball and lead their division by four games. For Boston, just about everything is clicking. Twenty games into the season, their lineup and pitching rotation are running like finely-tuned machines, and they show every sign of continuing to play like frontrunners. Meanwhile around the region, the Boston Celtics are in the midst of a first-round playoff series against the Milwaukee Bucks, a series they have every chance to win. The Boston Bruins lead their playoff series against the Toronto Maple Leafs 3-2. And the New England Patriots’ loss in Super Bowl LI has yet to fade from memory. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Considered all together, these events lead me to ask a simple question, one which New Englanders should consider during this period of sporting prosperity. Do New England sports fans know how good they’ve got it?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s on display this season, of course, but New England’s sporting success goes back much further. Since the turn of the millennium, the Bruins have made the playoffs 12 times and won a Stanley Cup. The Celtics have made the playoffs 14 times and won an NBA championship. The Patriots, of course, have made the playoffs 15 times since 2000, including every year since 2008 and have emerged victorious from five out of the eight Super Bowls in which they’ve appeared. And the Red Sox, in the same time frame, have made the playoffs nine times and won three World Series.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All in all, this has almost certainly been the most successful two-decade athletic stretch for one single region in history. And it has certainly won me over. Except for when they take on my New York teams, I root for New England teams whenever they play. I even support the Patriots, though, as a Jets fan, I’m supposed to regard them as bitter rivals. So I’ve enjoyed this period of prosperity almost as much as true-blue Boston fans have. But as an objective observer, I’ve also been able to reckon with a hard truth: It won’t last forever. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take it from me. I am a fan of the New York Mets, Jets, Rangers and Knicks. I watched the Rangers collapse in slow motion this very season: After a long run of playoff appearances over the past few years, including an appearance in the Stanley Cup Final, the 2018 Rangers fell victim to injuries and age and finished 34-39-9. The Jets have been similar — they’ve looked championship-bound several times, but it has never worked out. Chad Pennington, Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith, Ryan Fitzpatrick — a few of the Jets quarterbacks since 2000 who were supposed to lead us back to greatness, but ended up falling far short of expectations. The Knicks: Carmelo Anthony! Amar’e Stoudemire! Jeremy Lin! Kristaps Porzingis! We’ve had players that most teams can only dream of, yet somehow, it just hasn’t come together.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And then there are the Mets, who over the last few years have provided an almost perfect case study in what the Red Sox could be if their luck was just a little bit worse. The Mets have all the pieces: Pitchers Zack Wheeler, Steven Matz, Addison Reed and Rafael Montero; promising young hitters Brandon Nimmo, Juan Lagares and Dominic Smith; and established veterans David Wright, Lucas Duda and Neil Walker. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Except it didn’t quite work out. Wright is on the disabled list, perhaps for the rest of his career. Walker, Reed and Duda were traded away when the team faltered behind them. Nimmo and Lagares are stuck on the bench behind higher paid, lesser performing veterans. Smith and Montero are stuck in the minors; Wheeler and Matz have been oft-injured and so far have failed to live up to their immense potentials. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why are these failures important? Because they are all part of the normal course of running a baseball team, but the Red Sox have been able to avoid them for years. Sure, they’ve had setbacks, but it’s been a long time since a Boston team has suffered a truly devastating blow, the kind that tears a team down for a generation. Andrew Benintendi could lose his swing, or Hanley Ramirez’s power could abandon him. Mookie Betts could lose his speed, and with it, the Sox’s perennial playoff competition. It could be anything, and that’s the point. Maybe it won’t even be the Red Sox. Maybe it will be the Bruins, or the Patriots, or the Celtics, or all of them. Anything can happen in sports, and sooner or later, it will. I won’t enjoy it when the inevitable large-scale setback does occur: As I’ve said, I’m a fan of Boston teams, even the ones I’m supposed to dislike. But nevertheless, it has to happen eventually.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This may seem like a doomsday message, but it’s not. It’s a call to action and to emotion. New England, enjoy it while you can. Savor every moment that the Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics and Bruins are dependable playoff teams, and each year, give their fans a decent chance at a championship. Sure, great teams are fun to watch while they’re still great, and it’s easy to get swept up in the victories. But take it from someone who has seen greatness slip through a team’s fingers. Once it’s gone, you’ll miss it more than you can imagine.</span></p>

		<title>Vilsan &#039;19: Relationships 101</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Let’s talk about relationships. The word has romantic connotations, but in reality, relationships are central to every part of our lives, from the personal to the professional. So isn’t it surprising that there are no courses offered at Brown intended to help students develop critical soft skills — skills that one could argue are more important to our personal and professional growth than many of the technical skills we learn in our classes now? Over the last 30 years, academics across the country have created courses specifically designed to create a more holistic college experience — one that emphasizes interpersonal expertise as well as resume qualifications. Indeed, given the growing automation in today’s society, communication skills are becoming increasingly valuable in the workforce precisely because they cannot be quantified. Thus, it is about time that Brown offers soft skills training as part of its course selection.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, Brown students are developing important interpersonal skills every day through their course work, extracurricular engagements and team projects. One could even argue that soft skills are not teachable — that they must be absorbed through constant human interaction and experiential learning. However, a study conducted by Boston College, Harvard and the University of Michigan found that targeted soft skills training delivers a 250 percent return on investment based on higher productivity and <a href="http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/24468-soft-skills-training-boosts-productivity">employee retention</a>. Therefore, we should do away with the myth that soft skills must be developed through real world experience and are thus impossible to teach in a traditional classroom setting. There is a reason why professional recruiting places so much emphasis on behavioral interviews — companies are looking for the perfect mix of technical and interpersonal expertise. And although our courses are a great foundation for the kind of communication and leadership skills required to excel within the professional world, Brown students would benefit from Relationships 101.</p>
<p class="p2">The CareerLAB currently offers the closest thing to soft skills training on campus: a variety of workshops aimed at helping students prepare for and succeed at the interviewing process. These workshops are undoubtedly useful in teaching students how to best portray their skills and how to establish professional relationships with recruiters. But are they enough? Institutions such as Northeastern University have semester-long courses dedicated to teaching students professional etiquette. Meanwhile, at Brown, we often rely on peer advice when communicating with employers, as there is not always a slot open to speak with a counselor when we need guidance on email writing or informational phone calls. What’s more, once we have received our job offers, we often mistakenly believe that our work is done. There are no workshops available at the career center on building networks within a company or developing the interpersonal skills that will be critical to getting promoted. Focusing on the interviewing process exclusively is a narrow-minded approach to career counseling, and it will leave many Brown students struggling to communicate and adapt within a professional setting.</p>
<p class="p2">Finally, some institutions are going beyond basic interpersonal training and offering targeted courses intended to help students with romantic or personal relationships. Leslie Parrott, co-founder of the Center for Relationship Development at Seattle Pacific University, claims that <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6968834/ns/us_news-education/t/colleges-offer-classes-relationships/#.WruzXb3wZ0s">research regularly shows</a> “students are often more focused on relationship quality than their careers.” In her class, Parrott focuses on teaching students how to enter and maintain healthy romantic relationships. Other universities, such as Santa Clara University, offer courses on navigating the realities and intricacies of marriage — a lesson that is often learned after one has already walked down the aisle. Although some may believe that these courses go beyond the scope of education we should expect at Brown, it is likely that such unconventional instruction would be widely beneficial. Many students find it challenging to balance their personal and professional lives upon graduation. Curricular emphasis on relationship building could certainly improve these students’ overall quality of life.</p>
<p class="p2">We know that soft skills are critical to our success both in our personal and professional lives, yet we often neglect interpersonal training in favor of technical skills that we can plaster on our resumes. It is Brown’s responsibility to help students reevaluate this delicate balance. Without a healthy education in soft skills, Brown students will likely find that a perfect GPA will fall short in the workplace. The good news is that these skills are teachable and learnable — and with a few tweaks to the Brown course selection, students can dramatically improve their overall college and post-graduation experiences.</p>

		<title>Aman &#039;20: Why is Brown’s room and board so expensive?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Apr. 17, The Herald published spring poll results that <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/17/students-cite-convenience-finances-stealing-food/">found</a> many students report stealing regularly from Brown eateries. When asked to explain their behavior, students expressed the belief that stealing helped them derive more<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of the value of their meal plans. For example, one student explained, “If I take one more meal for the week, I really don’t think that’s going over the value of my plan, considering how much I’m paying Brown.” This feeling is understandable, given that a meal credit can cost anywhere from $9 to $20, depending on the <a href="https://brown.cafebonappetit.com/meal-plans/">meal plan</a>. Like the plans offered by Brown University Dining Services, on-campus housing — which costs roughly $1,140 <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/financial-aid/tuition-and-fees">per month</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— is also often considered a rip-off, because higher quality off-campus housing can be <a href="https://www.apartments.com/off-campus-housing/ri/providence/brown-university/7/?bb=_64ku_-tpH26gvwD">substantially less expensive</a>. These frustrations are compounded by the fact that students are the very definition of a captive market, as we <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/families/dining">must purchase</a> one year of meal plan<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and live in <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/families/life-campus/housing/residency-requirement">on-campus housing</a> as underclassmen to attend Brown. (It is also notoriously difficult to get permission to obtain more affordable, off-campus housing.) These high costs and restrictive policies create a pervasive sense that Brown is trying to squeeze every last penny out of us, which leads me to ask: If the University is a nonprofit, why do I always feel like I’m dealing with an airline?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There might be very good reasons why housing and meal plans are so expensive. Perhaps our dorm buildings are older, and therefore need more expensive upkeep than local apartments. Perhaps high meal plan costs are necessary to pay the wages of those who prepare our food, as a student in the earlier Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/17/students-cite-convenience-finances-stealing-food/">article</a> hypothesized. Perhaps high meal plan and on-campus housing costs are used to subsidize financial aid.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the University has good reasons for charging us such exorbitant prices, where does the money go? To be clear, I’m not accusing Brown of taking advantage of us, and I’d like to believe that Brown is actually justified in charging the prices that it does. Rather, in the absence of transparency, it can feel like Brown is ripping us off. The University does publish an annual fiscal report that includes a broad overview of the budget. In 2017, Brown <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/president/sites/president/files/Presidents_Financial_Report_FY17.pdf">spent</a> 41 percent of its budget on salaries and wages, 12 percent on employee benefits, 8 percent on graduate student support, 8 percent on depreciation, 15 percent on supplies, 10 percent on purchased services, 3 percent on utilities and 3 percent on interest. Yet these statistics don’t answer students’ primary questions: Why are room and board so expensive, and where is our money really going? This question is especially salient considering that Brown <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/financial-aid/tuition-and-fees">charges</a> $14,670 for room and board, while private, nonprofit, four-year universities charged on average $12,210 for room and board in the 2017-18 school year, <a href="https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-fees-room-and-board-over-time">according to the College Board</a>. Sure, higher education in the United States is expensive across the board — but an annual premium of $2,460 is a sizeable sum.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Brown doesn’t have an obligation to offer us an explanation of how they spend our room and board payments, and we, as students, will likely continue to purchase meal plans and on-campus housing in order to attend. Yet this lack of transparency encourages harmful behavior, allowing students to feel justified in stealing from Brown eateries. More importantly, it contributes to a sense that the administration does not have our best interests at heart, acting more like an exploiter than an accountable steward of the student body. Greater transparency and thoughtful communication will help build trust between the administration and students, and ultimately strengthen the basis of our community.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2017, the University undertook a massive fundraising campaign to remove financial barriers to accessing a Brown education. The Brown Promise initiative raised enough money to eliminate loans from undergraduate financial aid packages starting in the 2018-2019 school year. This is a fantastic step toward ensuring that students from middle-income homes can graduate without being <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/12/promise">saddled with student debt</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As our campus community reflects on the importance of access to education, it would serve us well to look outside of the bounds of College Hill. Earlier this year, members of the board of the Providence Public School District <a href="http://www.wpri.com/news/dan-mcgowan/with-providence-school-department-facing-massive-budget-problems-school-board-leaders-seek-solutions/1082481025">raised concerns</a> about looming budget shortfalls. State funding increases will begin to level off over the next five years, and board members are not optimistic about the <a href="https://lintvwpri.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/hemond-pande-letter-re-budget-proposals-2-21-2018.pdf">prospect of funding</a> increases from the city due to budget constraints. PPSD is looking for ways to tighten its belt, attempting to slash expenditures in order to avoid a $3.7 million deficit in 2019 that is projected to balloon to $37 million by 2023. The cuts will hurt, but right now they seem inevitable. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As PPSD works to decrease their spending, we ought to consider ways to increase their funding.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit — a status that confers substantial financial advantages. A<a href="https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Review-of-RI-PILOT-Agreements-Narrative-September-29-2015.pdf"> 2015 report</a> by Providence’s Internal Auditor showed that in 2015, the University owned over 150 tax-exempt buildings. Taken together, their valuation was a little over a billion dollars. Commercial property in Providence is taxed at <a href="http://www.municipalfinance.ri.gov/documents/data/taxrates/2017-Tax-Rates-12-31-16-FINAL.pdf">3.67 percent of its valuation</a>. Based on <a href="http://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tax-Rates-2016.pdf">these figures</a>, it seems that Brown avoids paying roughly $37.8 million to the city of Providence each year due to its tax-exempt status. This number will increase yearly as Brown’s new property purchases are slowly removed from the tax rolls over a 15-year phase-out period. (It is worth emphasizing that not all of Brown’s properties are tax-exempt. In 2015, 23 of Brown’s 193 buildings were 100 percent on the tax rolls.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Instead of paying property taxes on exempt buildings, Brown makes payments to the city of Providence through a PILOT — payment in lieu of taxes — program. In a 2003 agreement, Brown agreed to pay a total of $24.6 million to the city of Providence over a 20-year period. This number has grown over the years, with Brown making several additional agreements with the city. Between 2004 and 2007, Brown paid the city an additional $1.3 million. And when Providence faced bankruptcy in 2012, Brown agreed to pay the city an extra <a href="http://www.gcpvd.org/2012/05/01/mayors-office-release-on-31-5-million-agreement-with-brown-university/">$31.5 million over 11 years</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All told, this still means that Brown pays a fraction of what its taxes would be if it weren’t a <a href="http://ripr.org/post/lifespan-resumes-pilot-payments-providence#stream/0">nonprofit</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University certainly benefits financially from its nonprofit status. And so it should — Brown is a cutting-edge research institution that adds substantially to the Providence landscape. But at the same time, Brown is a member of the Providence community, and this means that we have responsibilities. The University is a tremendously wealthy institution that sits on valuable land in Providence’s East Side. We benefit from policies that allow us to avoid paying property taxes on the majority of University buildings. We occupy land that would otherwise be a valuable stream of tax revenue for the city of Providence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown swiftly raised $30 million from alums for the Brown Promise initiative. Perhaps it’s time for another promise — one that demonstrates a commitment to quality education access for young people in Providence. As an institution dedicated to higher learning, Brown has a role to play in making sure that every student in Providence, regardless of means, can access a quality public school education. As PPSD stares down a budget shortfall, we should seriously consider the ways Brown might wield its financial power for the good of our neighbors. Brown increasing its payments to Providence won’t solve all of PPSD’s budget problems, but we can and should be part of the solution.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It might seem appealing to assert the claim that Brown isn’t obligated to do any of this. After all, we’re a 501(c)(3) with tax exemptions, we already make PILOTs and we’ve contributed to the character of the city since 1764. But we’re part of the fabric of Providence, which means that Providence’s interests are, to a large extent, our interests. Students across the nation deserve to attend adequately funded schools, but it would be especially egregious for students in the city to go without resources while the University up the hill works toward completing its $120 million financial aid fundraising project. As we renew our commitment to the accessibility of quality education, it’s our job to make sure we’re also looking beyond our gates.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">President Trump has many betes noires — his enemies, some of his friends, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-germ-phobia-howard-stern-melania-knauss-tapes-1993-interview-newsweek-factbase-a7967731.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524852707147000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE955v--XiFjsIVB3XkualVUiz-nQ">germs</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/352796146927796226?lang=en">sharks</a>, to name a few — but none is more despised than the “FAKE NEWS <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/832230758299340800?lang=en">media.”</a> And nothing the FAKE NEWS media does winds him up more than when it quotes “phony unnamed <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/886544734788997125?lang=en">sources”</a> on dysfunction in his White House.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p2">Yet much in the way that children’s books often deal with adult themes, his tweets can pose serious questions, in this case about anonymity in journalism: when its recipients should be trusted; when its power dynamics are unfair; when editors are responsible for errors committed under its cover; when it is more prejudicial than protective. A recent experience I had with the College Hill Independent, another publication at Brown, shows that these dilemmas, and their attendant ethical and editorial failures, extend to college papers as well.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Six weeks ago in these pages, I <a href="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/16/samilow-19-academic-boycotts-are-bad-for-the-academy/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524852707147000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8CYpkFhoJw1qeOVWyIQ_nAWSKLg">panned an event</a> — put on by Brown’s Middle East Studies program — that promoted a boycott of Israeli universities. I argued that academic boycotts, no matter how righteous they might seem, should be rejected because they establish “one standard of pedagogy for teaching Israel, and another standard of pedagogy for teaching all other countries.” This imbalance in scholarship, I said, is “a form of political activism that invariably corrupts education.” I also noted that MES’s series of talks, known as “Critical Conversations,” has featured panelists who almost exclusively hail from the post-colonial far-left. “Not one has included an individual who defends Israel with half the intensity of the median panelist who criticizes it,” I wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p2">I knew I was touching a third rail but didn’t expect it to take so long for the electric shock to be delivered. A few days went by. Then a week. Then a month. A <a href="http://www.theindy.org/1450">response</a> finally appeared last Friday, in the Indy. It was printed anonymously, under the byline D.A.M.A.J. The 1,500-word think piece didn’t talk about only me, but when it did, D.A.M.A.J. accused me of “exemplify(ing) (a) dangerous, anti-democratic ideology that seeks to diminish dissenting voices within the Israeli nation.” What did I do to earn the dubious honor of “exemplifying” an anti-democratic ideology? I had complained that the MES event “lacked ideological diversity” (D.A.M.A.J.’s words) but I failed to mention that one of the panelists, Professor Ariella Azoulay, was Israeli herself. So apparently I was “openly discrediting Azoulay’s voice as unworthy of representing an Israeli perspective.”</p>
<p class="p2">This obviously makes no sense: Being Israeli doesn’t mean you represent a mainstream or supportive position on Israel. Indeed, Azoulay is an expat who <a href="https://mlaboycott.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/the-right-not-to-be-a-perpetrator-ariella-azoulays-statement-in-support-of-bds/">publicly supports the boycott</a>, divestment and sanctions movement as a way to free Israeli Jews from becoming “perpetrators” of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“crimes against humanity.” She’s free to think and say whatever she wants, but she can’t exactly be offended if I don’t see her as sympathetic to Israel. I was clearly talking about the views of the panelists, not their nationalities.</p>
<p class="p2">But maybe this is just quibbling. I’m far more dismayed that the Indy allowed this commentary to be published anonymously, and I said so to the managing editors. The three agreed to meet me immediately, but insisted that it was proper to let D.A.M.A.J. hide in the shadows because the author is afraid of personal or professional repercussions if they go on record as being critical of Israel. I don’t doubt D.A.M.A.J.’s sincerity, but editors have to independently balance a writer’s concerns against the asymmetry of an anonymous reply. And in this case, the balance tips sharply against incognito mode. I wrote using my name. I took, and am taking, the risks that come with that: public disapproval, the embarrassment of making a mistake, creating a permanent record of my views on this topic. It’s quite common for a named reporter to quote unnamed sources, but it’s virtually unheard of for newspapers to publish political analysis with no byline. Student newspapers should take seriously their role in fairly mediating debate between students, and their responsibility to make sure that their contributors are held accountable for their views.</p>
<p class="p2">People in invisible houses shouldn’t throw stones — especially when they have no aim. D.A.M.A.J. too “exemplifies” something: how anonymity compromises a writer’s caution. D.A.M.A.J. says CAMERA, a pro-Israel media watchdog group, is “known to blacklist students and professors” who are “remotely critical” of Israel, lumping it in with the likes of organizations like Canary Mission. No citation is offered for this remarkable accusation against CAMERA, and that’s because there’s no evidence CAMERA blacklists students for their views on Israel. It criticizes news articles and public statements it thinks are incorrect, biased or anti-Semitic. D.A.M.A.J. may think that CAMERA is too trigger-happy with alleging anti-Semitism or is deliberately unfair; that’s an opinion they’re entitled to. But they can’t produce any articles suggesting it blacklists students or professors. Writers tend to be careful to characterize their opposition generously so as to avoid inadvertent slander. But I guess when you’re writing anonymously, why bother?</p>
<p class="p2">You might wonder: Why not reply in the Indy, since it’s their judgment I’m questioning? Indeed I asked to. After all, their website boasts, “Though our editing process provides an internal structure for accountability, we always welcome letters to the editor.” They said sure: next fall.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like many first-year students, I arrived at Brown with bright eyes, elated to begin college at what I considered the perfect school. This was my chance to live the dream: the American dream my parents had worked so hard to realize, immigrating to the United States so their children could have a better education; the collegiate dream of getting accepted to an Ivy League school; my own teenage dreams of learning and living with like-minded, enthusiastic and interesting people. I lived in paradise. I was so lucky, and I had to be grateful for everything. This was the story I kept telling myself during my early years at Brown.

I thought I loved Brown. I threw myself into every opportunity — classes, socializing, sports, research, acting, editing. But something was off. I kept learning hard truths that I couldn’t reconcile with my idyllic love of Brown. It occurred to me that what I loved was not Brown itself, but the idea of Brown as a perfect, safe haven of a school with students ranked as the happiest in the country. As I spent more years here, Brown demanded that I confront uncomfortable truths about what I held dear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

This is the America of my parents’ dreams, where every child has an equal chance at going to school and living a good life; but I learned that it is also a place that has exploited my ancestors’ homeland and carries out systemic violence on a regular basis. This is the Brown of my dreams, where I have a world of disciplines at my fingertips and fellow students who support one another; but I learned that it is also a place susceptible to discrimination and silencing student voices — a place where people have hurt me in ways that will scar forever. The self of my dreams is caring, empathetic, responsible and proactive; but I learned I also can be someone who makes mistakes, who lashes out at people out of frustration and who doesn’t always come forward to apologize.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Over time, I saw myself as flawed, I saw Brown as flawed, I saw America as flawed, and it made me hurt. And while I know it is unrealistic to expect things to be perfect or unproblematic, it was the fact that my previous optimism felt so foolish that put me at a loss. I saw a concrete shift in the way I approached the unknown. My outlook switched from one of excitement to wariness; from automatically seeing the good in others to always looking for the caveats, knowing that flaws must exist. Did that make me a cynic? Is optimism always marked by naiveté?

I study cognitive neuroscience, so I know that as humans we dislike ambiguity and uncertainty — it’s uncomfortable. We are instinctually wired to sort things into simple positive or negative categories. We are much worse at confronting entities that encompass aspects of both: seeing people, places and communities with all of the complexity and contradiction with which they naturally exist. It is why relationships can become more difficult the more intimately we get to know ourselves, friends, partners and homes. Proximity forces faults to be placed squarely in view, yet that very intimacy makes you prone to turning a blind eye. It is hard to accept that what you hold dear may hurt you or others. It means questioning whether your love, derived from the picturesque veneer that originally enchanted you, is strong enough to confront painful nuances.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

The full weight of this realization can be devastating. You feel betrayed. You feel guilty for not realizing sooner the terrible, systemic injustices that govern the world. And it can be hard not to simply let yourself spiral into disdain or apathy.

But if there’s anything Brown has taught me, it is that we should not shy away from this discomfort. Our moral outrage at the disparity between the world as it is and the world as it ought to be should not be dismissed, as it indicates our commitment to personal values and justice. We must give ourselves the space to process those feelings of discomfort. Yet anger cannot be our sole motivator. If we allow it to be the primary fuel for our efforts, we will inevitably burn out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

However, subduing this rage leaves a void. Without it, what can motivate us to commit to the long, hard work necessary to pursue justice, to fight the good fight? I find that motivation in the belief that each small struggle towards justice means fewer people will experience the pain that we know. We must continue to hold onto hope while also remaining critical — to not get caught up in solely proving all the ways that the world is bad, but to use that knowledge to propose new solutions, help each other heal and make the world we envisioned become a reality. We have all experienced a Brown education. We have all been awakened to the flawed reality. We must now become empowered agents that may bring about positive change.

What makes me believe that we can do this? I believe because I know that I am not alone. I believe because I can contribute to a legacy of powerful solidarities formed between Brown students, who showed up at protests, in statehouses, at meetings and on the streets. I believe because I witnessed the difficult conversations that are negotiated in dorm hallways, on social media and in print. I believe because I learned from my peers the value in each voice and the importance in listening. I believe because I have felt the power in exposing vulnerabilities and the tenacity with which we support each other, no matter how we do so. I believe because I know that many of the unique and cherished parts of Brown only exist because of students’ efforts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

I still love Brown, no longer as the flawless ideal I saw before, but as a place where students had the imagination to conceive of something better and the grit to make it so. This is what we should celebrate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The summer before my first year at Brown, whilst deep in the throes of high school nostalgia, I stumbled across a Huffington Post blog titled, “Letting Go of Your Memory Ghost.” It began: “Do you know what a memory ghost is? It’s not an actual ghost of course. It’s the pizzeria that takes you back to your first kiss. It’s the song that brings back those long summer nights. It’s the movie you can’t see without missing your best friend. It’s the book you used as an escape during a rough time. A memory ghost is a memory that is so strong, it’s left an invisible mark so it can never be forgotten.”

The paragraph stayed in my mind for days thereafter. Perhaps it was because certain memories were at the forefront of my mind: I was clinging to my childhood for dear life, willing the days to slow down so I could enjoy my time at home in Singapore for as long as I could.

I began to collect my own memory ghosts that summer before college. The sound of Indian folk songs and the flutter of bird wings on weekend mornings with my parents. The smell of peanut butter and waffles, my snacks at the end of a long school day. Before I knew it, I had a hefty list of ghosts to carry around with me.

This winter, I came across the note containing my memory ghosts on my old phone. Reading it, I felt like a 17-year old on the cusp of moving halfway across the world all over again. I couldn’t help but ask myself: What are my memory ghosts from Brown? What moments, experiences and fragments of time will jolt me back to Brown long after I pack my bags and leave College Hill?

It starts with the image of colorful Post-Its peeping out of the pages of crumbling old paperback books. I’ve carried the small, arrow-shaped Post-Its in my pencil case every day for the past four years, pasting them onto everything from comics to textbooks. They line all the books that changed my life over the past four years — “The New Jim Crow,” “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” “The Marriage Plot” (could I be any more of a Brown student?) — and cover my desk, floor and bag like pointed confetti. They will always remind me of all that I have learned and all that I have yet to understand.

There’s the smell of breakfast sandwiches and coffee in the morning (let’s be honest, we’ve all subsisted on bagels and coffee at some point or the other). Wherever I go after graduation, I am convinced these scents will always bring me back to the long lines at Blue State and Bagel Gourmet Ole.

And then there are the songs that played in the background all through my time at Brown. The Disney songs that my friends and I used to sing at night in J. Walter Wilson — and once, embarrassingly, in the Brown Evening Shuttle — to drown out the sorrows and stresses of freshman year. The Hamilton songs that were the soundtrack of my sophomore year (“Take a Break” and “[I Will Never Be] Satisfied” were two song titles that particularly resonated). The awkward mix of pop-rock and country that flooded my playlists in junior year, and the sappy ballads that mirrored my mood swings this past year. The songs I listened to at Brown are like time capsules to specific moments and emotions.

There are so many other ghosts: the smell of morning dew on grass and Blue Room muffins; the “CAUTION: BUS IS TURNING” announcement that wakes me up each morning; the taste of overly sweet bubble tea. As I started to count them up, I realized that this list dwarfed my old list from high school. In just four years, Brown seems to have become even more embedded in my psyche than Singapore, my home of 18 years. And in a way, that makes sense: College is a transformative period in every student’s life. We grew up at Brown, discovered who we are, and withstood some of the greatest challenges of our lives so far. My memories of college are littered with moments of strong emotion — both elation and despair. The ghosts that arise from these memories are all the more vivid and tangible.

I don’t know where life will take me in the future, but I am absolutely sure that my memory ghosts from Brown will always come with me. For the rest of my life, I will be transported back to campus when I smell fresh muffins as I walk down the street, or hear the tunes of Hamilton on my phone. Maybe one day I will return to Providence and relive all these memories again. But until then, I am proud to treasure these moments and remain Ever True.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I distinctly remember the dread that filled me when I sat down to write my “Why Brown?” essay five years ago. Scattered across my desk were brochures collected from dozens of college fairs, and my browser was clogged with 20 or so tabs of college websites and student forums that I had been scouring for days. I had spent the past week in a state of frustration, juggling a series of questions that flickered endlessly in my mind. Why Northwestern? Why Penn? Why Tufts? And now, Why Brown?

The entire idea of “college” had obscured into a huge blur. My pessimistic and easily homesick high-school-self saw college as just another four years of school — an in-between phase before entering into the real world<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— and, unlike many of my friends, I never grew up having a dream school of any sort.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

At some point, all the “big name” American schools began to evoke the same array of images in my mind: sprawling patches of grass, ivy-clad brick buildings lined up adjacently, students lounging outdoors playing frisbee, spacious cafeterias with American buffets of fries and burgers.

My distinct lack of creativity and disillusionment with the entire application process inevitably shone through in my 200-word “Why Brown?” essay. Like most Brown applicants, I had thought it a wise idea to detail my enthusiasm about the open curriculum and my excitement toward unparalleled academic freedom. Looking back, I feel freshly embarrassed about how little I knew about Brown at the time. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

On decision day, I shared with my sister my concerns that Brown might not be the right place for me. I had concluded from a cursory Google “Things to Do in Providence” search that transitioning from Hong Kong to Providence would be like moving into a rural village, and I had also begun to question if I was mentally ready for the kind of independence that Brown students all seemed to effortlessly embody. A rising junior at Penn at the time, she assured me, “Don’t worry. You’ll end up wherever you belong.” I wondered if that would be true.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

I arrived on College Hill with three overweight suitcases and a sinking feeling of uncertainty about what life at Brown would be like. Fall semester only increased my insecurities. When shopping period came, friends and acquaintances alike gushed about shopping more than 20 classes. Far from the much-advertised imagery of basking in the unparalleled freedom of the open curriculum, I found myself slumped in front of my laptop, staring blankly at the three classes in my cart and feeling pathetically stressed about not being the daring and experimental student that Brown has long prided itself on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

These questions resurfaced when in my comparative literature first-year-seminar, all the students in the class spoke with a kind of confidence and clarity I found I could not imitate. I worried incessantly about whether I could ever muster the courage to add my voice to this class.

Even little things like language exacerbated feelings of foreignness. When I asked a girl in my unit where the rubbish bin was and she replied with a laugh, “Where are you from? You mean the trash can?” When a girl shot me a confused look when I asked her where the lift was. And, unforgettably, when I taught a creative art class at D’Abate Elementary School, and a first grader asked me, “Do you speak like this at home? Ching-chong-ling-long?”

But Brown has really grown on me since the anxious early moments of freshman fall, and looking back, it is the exciting moments of growth and self-discovery that define my time here. I can’t put my finger on a specific time when I began to feel a true sense of belonging on College Hill,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>but it might have been when I got my first byline at The Herald for a story on the homeless population in Providence, or when, after a month of tirelessly conducting interviews, I finally completed a lengthy feature on police violence in the city. Or it might have been in an interesting politics lecture, or in a heated discussion in a religious studies seminar. Or it might have even been at a moment much less monumental but memorable nonetheless — a run to Blackstone Park or a walk on the Main Green.

Somewhere between Chicken Finger Fridays and sophomore year Waterfires, and somewhere between sifting through the subtleties of <i>Ice Palace</i> and <i>Beloved</i> in Rites of Passage, I felt both relieved and grateful to have found a place like Brown where I could be myself, carve my own path, and discover what I love.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Here, as I sit in my apartment, the walk through Van Wickle Gates is barely two weeks away, and the prospect of embarking on full-fledged adult life is far too close for comfort. As I walk through the gates I know I will be again filled with insecurities about what life off College Hill will bring. But at the same time I know I feel deeply lucky to have discovered a sense of belonging defined by the people I brunch with on Sundays and line up with for Free Cone Day, the books I complain about reading for class but secretly love, the familiar strangers I share awkward smiles with on Thayer … a sense of belonging to Brown.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My first day at Brown, I remember excitement and nerves. The smell of a fresh coat of paint as I walked into my dorm, the flash of a camera bulb as I took my ID picture.

But most of all, I remember stepping into my first modern culture and media class. Opening the heavy oak door of Wilson Hall, pushing past crowded rows of wide-eyed students. I waited alongside my peers as our professor walked in, larger than life, carrying with her the secrets of the silver screen.

She started with a question. “What is the power of your words?”

My pen hung over my notebook, unable to answer. How could I sift through the infinite uses of language? She looked around the room, watching the question linger.

Then, quietly, she spoke: “See, the way I see the community at Brown, we are all a network of individuals, spaced evenly apart, buffered by our own experiences and silent histories. The only thing that connects us is an invisible network made up of the stories we tell one another; the words we speak into existence, and by extension, what we write on paper to share beyond the boundaries of our community.”

If this is the case, then the power of our words is in how we use them, if only because each of us weaves our story into others, knitting this community together.

Which then begs the question; how will we use the power of our words?

I’ve thought about this lesson many times as I grapple with existing in the space between being a student of color and a screenwriter on this campus. I am often reminded of a quote by storyteller, Teju Cole, who said “writing as writing, writing as rioting, writing as righting. On the best day, all three.”

My personal history as a storyteller started at age nine. Much to my parents’ frustration, I used to write on my hands as a child. Ballpoint pen tattoos; hastily scrawled from fragments of creative inspiration. Potential stories were woven around sketches. Narrative arcs ran perpendicular to lines of dialogue. My hands told the physical story that my mind was still processing; an amalgam of ideas across genres, informed by the stories I read and heard.

By the time I reached 19, I had transferred to Brown, ready to pull my words from the physicality of my hands and reconstruct these threads along the lines of art, literature and emotion to form screenplays.

But I found it much harder to write the stories of my lived experiences among the artist communities at Brown. I would go from one student film set to another and encounter variations of the same narratives. Whether it was for a mystery or romance or adventure film, every casting call always ended with pale skin, every scene was framed through blue eyes. Faced with an internalized pressure of wanting to fit in — wanting to write work that others saw as valuable — my words slowly began to conform. I followed Hollywood’s biggest narratives, choosing stories that featured white men, marginalized white women, erased people of color completely. When I finally wrote my first screenplay, I traced the words from the palms of someone else’s hands.

I was writing, but my words were only operating at the most basic level. Writing was used to construct text, nothing more.

Perhaps it was serendipitous then that Brown gave its second important lesson in the back of another classroom. In a screenwriting course my junior year, we were tasked with an assignment. “Find a story that magnifies one part of your identity and build on it”. Upon hearing this, the guilt and longing for my Indian heritage built up inside of me, and I reached for the first author I thought of: Salman Rushdie.

After I finished Rushdie’s “Midnight’s Children,” I realized how much I had lost of my identity in the last few years. I picked up another, filled with more words of an Indian author. And the more I read, the more I discovered characters that I recognized in myself. These stories had names with the same syntax as my parents’, it contained humor in words with double meanings in Hindi and English and wrote of grandmothers who peeled mangoes in the same way mine did. These stories gave me comfort in belonging. More importantly, they showed me how to use my words in a way that saved me from the singular narratives of mainstream entertainment.

I began to work with a community of minority filmmakers at Brown who questioned the assumptions of Western writing and explored how to represent diverse narratives. We wrote together, filling page after page with worlds that contained characters of all shades and sizes. Finally, Brown offered a space where women were not objects, immigrants were not helpless and people were not just statistics.

The mere existence of powerful women and people of color in film became a tool of protest. At Brown, my writing became rioting.

The summer before senior year, Brown gave its third lesson. For my thesis, I interviewed communities that had been historically silenced in an attempt to bring their stories to light. I spoke with members of the homeless population, undocumented students and those living below the poverty line. I gathered conversations and bore witness to generational trauma.

But beyond asking what stories I should tell, the Brown curriculum urged me to ask how these communities would like to be portrayed. I sat with one woman as she relied tales of her life and shed light on stories of endemic drug use, violence and discriminatory public policy. At the end of our conversation, I asked how she would like herself imagined as a character.

She paused, startled, and began to cry, as she was so flattered that someone thought to ask her how she would like to interrogate her own story. The simple act of transferring the narrative role to the subject gave her the agency to determine her own depiction for the first time. That day, Brown showed me how to use words to right injustice.

As I reflect on these lessons, it seems as if so much of how the world is perceived is constituted in the way it is written — the characters highlighted, the narratives chosen, the settings given preference.

Yet equally important are the voices that are conspicuously missing, whether purposefully or gradually. Since arriving at Brown, we have all been asked to question narratives of history: Who has been given the right to speak up?

To address this question, we must select the narratives of the present that represent the world we hope to see. We must question which stories have not been told and demand their creation. We must examine our role within society, and give and make space accordingly. If there is one thing that the sociopolitical climate of the last few years has taught us, it is that we cannot simply wait for a more equitable world. We have come of age at the cusp of a civil rights movement, and it is up to us to interrogate the assumptions of a single narrative.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ll never forget my father’s last words to me before I started college: “Michelle, every single person at this school is going to be smarter than you.”

I still remember that moment so clearly, standing on the sidewalk outside of Keeney Quad in the relentless August heat. I was in a beloved teal blouse that I have long since outgrown, he was in a navy t-shirt with “MOTOR CITY” emblazoned across the front. I blinked at him in the sunlight, unsure if he was trying to encourage or scare me. Perhaps it was both.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Dads. You can never really tell with them.

Reading the confusion on my face, after a moment, he continued. “Everyone at this school might be smarter than you, but you know how to work just as hard as they do. You always have.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Though his explanation did nothing to assuage my confusion, his words caught my attention. They seemed awfully weighty as we stood together on the sun-bleached brick sidewalk of an institution I never believed I’d be able to attend.

My parents grew up far from Providence, in Manila and Mandaluyong in the Philippines. When they came to the United States, they settled in Michigan — a place where they were the only brown Filipino faces in a sea of white, generations-old Midwestern families. There, my younger brother and I grew up, raised in a family dependent on the automotive industry.

We started to grow up a little faster once the automotive industry withered in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis. Most of my adolescence was spent waiting with baited breath as the life my parents had built for us swayed on its shaky foundation. Throughout it all, they held firm to that classic American belief that hard work begets success, and they repeated this mantra to my brother and me time and time again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

For so long, I believed them. I cried tears of joy when I opened my Brown acceptance letter. But my father cried too, and I remember the way that misery crept into his voice as he replied, “It doesn’t matter, Michelle. We can’t afford it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

I spent the next month selfishly wrapped up in my sadness and anger, my days full of tears. But unbeknownst to me, while I spent my time wallowing, my parents spent theirs figuring out how to make Brown possible for me. With Brown unwilling to reconsider the financial aid package they offered, my parents spent those few weeks marking out what necessities they could learn to reconsider as luxuries. On the last day before my response was due, as I resigned myself to turning down Brown for the sake of my family’s well-being, my father looked over at me from across our tiny kitchen. “Michelle, I will have nothing to leave to you when I die,” he said. “But while I’m alive I can try and help pay for your education.”

Somehow, some way, he made it work. And since the day I walked through the Van Wickle Gates, I wake up each morning thinking about how my parents pushed aside their own dreams so that I might have the chance to pursue mine. Each day I remind myself that my success might be the only way I am able to repay them. Their sacrifice emphasizes how much faith they’ve placed in me and in my Brown education — and to this day, that still terrifies me. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

As I began my freshman year, I told myself that finding success at Brown would somehow justify my parents’ sacrifices. But as I quickly realized, things don’t often go according to plan in college.

The differences between my little Michigan public high school and Brown’s ivory towers were startling. I felt inadequately prepared for my classes compared to my prep-school-primed peers. I felt unworthy of friendship, for I felt that I had so little to offer compared to my classmates. I felt an exacerbated sense of disconnection with my Filipino identity, and I didn’t know how to go about understanding it. Although I didn’t yet know that mental illness had a name, I learned what it was like for anxiety to wake me at 4 a.m. and tell me to wander around Providence alone, in the dark, for hours. I learned what it was like to cry on the floor of the Keeney hallway hoping that someone — anyone — would find me and save me from being alone with my thoughts. I learned what it was like to drown so deeply in an eating disorder that I would spend days thinking only of food.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

When I returned home after freshman year, I meant to keep these things locked away, unseen and unheard. Not because I wasn’t wildly, desperately in need of help that I didn’t know how to ask for, but because I was terrified that admitting these things would be akin to failing my parents. They might feel that everything they had given up and hoped for had been for naught. Perhaps they would believe our deepest fears had been right: Brown was never meant for people like us. I told myself that if I never talked about it, it would be as if it wasn’t happening. I would need to convince my parents that I was living an idyllic college dream, just as they had always envisioned for me.

I should have known that plan was doomed from the start. One glance at me was all my dad needed to know that something was wrong. He drove me to the airport at the end of that summer after freshman year, the car quiet aside from the chatter of NPR. The only words between us were the ones he left me at the ticket counter with: “Work hard, but more importantly, be happy. That’s all that really counts.”

Then, the lesson I realized he’d been teaching me my whole life: “We love you.”

Somehow, slowly, thankfully, I remembered that his words were true. This reminder made all the difference for me. Success — whatever that might mean — comes and goes, but happiness is non-negotiable. Over the last few years, I’ve learned how to talk about the things that weigh heavy on my mind, to trust myself and my abilities despite my modest roots and to believe in my worth as a student and a friend. I learned that laughter and love work miracles, and I realized that both these and others were lessons I’d already learned as a little girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Four years later, I am grateful to be able to say: Dad, I’m happy. I am so, so happy. College has been harder than I ever imagined it would be, and I have had to survive things that I never dreamed I would need to endure. But there is so much light and love to be had in this world, and I am thankful that you’ve spent the last few decades of your life teaching me how to seek it.

Graduation holds so much unknown, and it guarantees change. I have no idea what those changes might be. Perhaps I’ll encounter forces that I cannot fight, or situations that I cannot control. Maybe everyone I encounter after walking out of the Van Wickle Gates will still be smarter than me. But what I know now, and what I wish I would have known standing on Benevolent Street all those years ago, is that no matter what, I’ll be okay. I am so lucky to be loved by both family and dear friends, and that is enough. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Coral Murphy: Unpacking Brown in less than a year</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Sept. 20, 2017, the biggest hurricane to ever hit Puerto Rico destroyed part of my home, left my community with a lack of interconnectivity for weeks and forced millions to live without necessities, including food and water. As a third-year student at the University of Puerto Rico, I was uncertain whether I would be able to continue my semester in the months that followed. We had only taken two days of classes before Hurricane María hit. At that point, I thought I had the rest of my college years figured out. But in the aftermath of the disaster, with my faculty’s roof torn off and debris overlaying the Río Piedras campus, I had to face the fact that things would be difficult. Little did I know that a month after the hurricane hit, I would be accepted to Brown to continue my academic year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

At the time, I didn’t know anything about Brown, except that it was an Ivy League school and Emma Watson was a student a few years ago. I applied to Brown’s hurricane relief program not expecting much, since I had grown used to my life post-María. A few days after applying, I received an email congratulating me for being accepted to Brown and alerting me that my flight would leave the next day. In a span of 24 hours, I left my job, said goodbye to everyone I could and packed my bags with clothing I had never used before to face the winter weather I had never experienced.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

On the plane headed to Providence, I quickly bonded with a few of the other students in the program. We were all from various parts of the island but all had been affected by the hurricane one way or another. It felt like a short plane ride thanks to the stories we shared on how our family dealt with the hurricane and its aftermath. None of us expected to be on that plane, headed to Providence, to one of the most prestigious universities in the world after going through one of the most traumatic events in Puerto Rico’s history. Although we were all excited for what awaited, some of us couldn’t help but feel guilty for leaving the island and our families in those conditions.

Upon my arrival in Providence, I immediately felt the cold New England air. I thought that was as bad as it was going to get, but now I understand that 60 degrees is a warm day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Everything was red. Fall was in its peak, and the leaves matched the colonial bricks of the buildings around me. As the driver dropped us off at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, members of the Brown administration were waiting for us in a semi-circle formation with big smiles on their faces. In the middle was Marisa Quinn, chief of staff to the Provost, who later became “our mom” during the year.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

I quickly learned that the University’s community is extremely cordial, friendly and helpful. As soon as I arrived at my room, I was greeted by residential peer leaders, and was later taken to the Ratty, which, in that moment, looked like Hogwarts to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

The day after I arrived, I was oriented on all the resources Brown had, met all the deans, and emailed professors to ask to join their classes, explaining my situation. Most of the professors were understanding, and asked me to join the class as soon as possible. I will forever be grateful for the professors that decided to accept me in their classes under such abrupt circumstances. I imagine it must have been strange for students to have a new student midway through the semester, especially when the new classmate is here for unfortunate reasons.

The other Puerto Rican students joined their classes comfortably, piling on clubs and organizations that welcomed them with open arms. Most of us had never even visited an Ivy League institution. Phrases like “meal plan,” “pass fail courses” and “extensions” were foreign to us. Calling professors by their first names and being asked my pronouns were completely new practices to me. I fell in love with how open-minded and inclusive Brown seemed to be.

Though these new experiences were exciting, it was hard to process everything that was going on around me, especially when things were happening so quickly. I went from rationing my food to having a buffet three times a day; from having a mid-tier education to attending an Ivy league school; from living in a 24/7 sun-filled environment to seeing snow for the first time. Everything was within my reach, and I had no idea how to take advantage of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Though Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, the cultures are completely different from one another. Small things like not greeting someone with a hug and a kiss on the cheek were a shock. I also felt like I was interacting with some of the most educated and hard-working people the world has to offer. This in itself created another type of culture shock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

But I’m thankful that I encountered this shock at Brown and not anywhere else. There were several safe spaces on campus, such as the Brown Center for Students of Color, that allowed me to bond with people who had already experienced this culture shock when they first arrived. I also had the support of the other UPR students who came with me. Some were going through the same adjustment period I was or were feeling it more intensely. The fact that we could understand each other because of our experiences before and after Hurricane María made me feel like I wasn’t alone. It made everything much more bearable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

There are things I didn’t get a chance to experience in my brief time on campus, of that I’m certain. There were many places unvisited, clubs I may never join and so many interesting people left unmet. But fully aware that my time here had a quickly approaching expiration date, I managed to squeeze my four Brunonian years into one.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As an applied math-economics concentrator, I’ve spent my undergraduate career learning about different ways to quantify the difference between an expected value and a true value. I’ve spent hours poring over notes and problem sets on concepts from mean squared error, which measures how close an estimated value is to the true value, to the Kullback–Leibler divergence, which measures the distance between a probability distribution and the true distribution. Though I could never quantify how much Brown means to me, I’ve begun to reflect on the difference between the expected and the true in my time here.

Before coming to campus, I spent months listening to my parents and teachers share stories their college memories. Friends who came home after their first year of college with thrilling stories about their new lives. As orientation neared, I could hardly wait to begin what I expected would be four years of self-discovery.

But my first night at Brown, I called my parents crying, feeling completely alone as I haphazardly tried to turn my room in Woolley into a place I could call home. That loneliness lingered for a while. When spring of my freshman year came, I questioned my belonging here in a way I had never experienced before. Though I was struggling and barely sleeping, I tried to convince myself that I loved Brown and that this was the perfect place to be. After all, it seemed everyone was supposed to feel that way about college. I eventually found the answer to that nagging doubt, though it’s hard to put a finger on exactly what changed. By junior year, as the leaves fell and grew back again, I realized I was engulfed in the familiarity of life on campus. I found I loved Brown beyond the expectations I had placed on it.

As my days on campus wind down, I’ve been trying to map out my memories here to think of what exceeded these expectations. There were ceremonious occasion like Convocation, when my roommate and I took a picture together right before we walked through the open gates. There was the time my roommates and I signed our lease for our senior year apartment, and all the fanfare of the last game I cheered after four years as a cheerleader.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

But I also find myself longing for the days that passed by quietly. It’s not a discrete memory that could be easily tied to a location, but rather a feeling of endless days spent with the most wonderful of people. I can’t put into words how familiar the cracks and crevices of the sidewalks, narrow stairs of Robinson Hall and the SciLi and, above all, the faces on campus feel now. This was truly what made Brown feel like my home, more than I ever could have expected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

I couldn’t be happier that the love I expected to have for Brown is so much different than the actual love I have for it now. Brown taught me how to dream, and the people I’ve met here have inspired and encouraged me to do so. Though I’m excited for what lies outside the gates, I also know that it took time to realize how special Brown is. With these memories, I wish that the flowers could hold back from blossoming and that we could stay suspended in time for just a little longer.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I left Puerto Rico to go to college, I had no intention of returning. I never felt quite at home there, in part because I did not look, speak or think like those around me. My mother is Iranian, my father is a Jew from Argentina, and I grew up speaking primarily English. This made it hard to relate to my mostly Catholic, Spanish-speaking peers. Though people took interest in my mixed background, I was also teased for what made me different.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In grade school, I often confused the English word “embarrassed” for the Spanish term “embarazar” which means to be pregnant. Thinking back now, I can see why people laughed. Missi, tell fulano to stop impregnating me!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>As I grew older, I became impatient, and the mere idea of college had me itching to leave. Before I ever stepped foot on Brown’s campus, I had begun to imagine it as my new home with my island far, far in the distance.

My first couple of years in Brown were their own brand of chaos. After years of feeling like an outsider, it was a great relief to be around so many like-minded people. It was a time of rigorous self-investigation and self-exploration. Poor fashion choices were made, as were questionable hairstyles. There was a time freshman year where I think I went through four ideological transformations in a single week.

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I had successfully escaped the clutches of my former home. I remember flying back to Puerto Rico that first summer after freshman year thinking I was unrecognizable, that I had outgrown my old community. What could this island possibly do for me besides hold me back?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The liberal arts education teaches a person how to think. Learning, in this view, is not the absorption of facts but of skills — how to analyze information, communicate your data, organize evidence and write persuasively. It is the act of taking an idea, whether it be a literary argument or scientific discovery, and placing it in conversation with others.

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In sophomore year, I decided to concentrate in history with a focus in modern America. While most of my classes were about Europe and the United States, I found myself repeatedly making connections to Puerto Rico. Brown gave me the tools to imagine new ways of relating to Puerto Rico. I started to consider how other Puerto Ricans related to the island and why they might have perceived me as an intruder. It’s not that my feelings of discomfort weren’t real, but that I was stuck there, unable to see past it. I came to Brown to learn who I could be outside of Puerto Rico, only to find that my identity was inextricably tied to it.

This past October, a category-five hurricane devastated my island. The days following the hurricane were extremely difficult. News seemed to only get worse. Suddenly, every complaint I had made of my home felt cruel in the face of such loss. I craved my community but felt shameful to either ask or offer support to people I had left behind. I had spent so much time differentiating myself from them, it felt hypocritical to take part in our shared grief. And so I waited, for the lights to turn back on, for some roads to be fixed, but even then, my shame persisted.

That winter, I took a plane home. In the seat next to me, a man with thick Puerto Rican accent — instead of rolling his r’s, he produced a guttural sound not unlike Hebrew — struck up a conversation. He asked me if I was Puerto Rican and I said yes. I waited for the eye twitch, the “but you don’t sound Puerto Rican!” Surely, this man, with his impenetrable Puertoricanness wouldn’t let a gringa like me call herself boricua without some kind of certification. But there was none of this. Instead, he asked me if my family was okay, and after I assured him they were, I asked him the same question. For the rest of the plane ride we spoke here and there, sharing memories of our childhood. At one point, he nearly teared up. I was sure he would change seats.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

“You felt ashamed?” he asked me. “I still do,” I said. “Shame is no good,” he told me, looking at me almost too close. “It’s just a failed pride.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Puerto Rico is not just a place, it is the people. People who I resented for having opinions other than my own. High school friends I dismissed as unimportant or unhelpful, family members I considered<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>outdated. What person would want to speak to someone who thinks of them in these terms? The past four years have shown me that I’m tired of choosing pride over relationships. I am tired of thinking I’m right.

Brown students are passionate. It is this passion that you hear in our voices when we protest sexual assault on campus, the lack of diverse university faculty and the potential deportation of DACA recipients. But it is also this passion that has garnered us the reputation for being difficult to speak with. Though at times I have disputed this accusation, and spiraled into a defensive or silent resentment, I know that I have not been exempt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

To communicate our ideas, we must consider our audience: to interpret a text, we are involving ourselves with another’s ideas; to write persuasively, we shape an argument for others to better understand us. All these skills imply not one, but many minds at work. Is it not imperative that we face the problem of conversation with the same creativity, thoughtfulness, and passion for which we are known?

I’d like to think I’ve grown a great deal since I first left Puerto Rico, though it’s more likely the tip of the iceberg. One would think that an Ivy League education might encourage a person to talk over people and seek out only the most insular of spaces. I’m resisting this habit. Because real learning occurs when we enter discussions, especially ones that scare us, with shared honesty and vulnerability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Kate Talerico: Pulled from the archives</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have spent hours flipping through past versions of Brown. The walls of The Herald’s office are lined with copies of the paper’s bound volumes dating back to 1892. Looking through them, I get swallowed up by the names of familiar places shrouded in unfamiliar sentiments.

In 1968, one student said that his dorm in the newly-constructed Grad Center felt like “living in the future.” In 1985, the GCB struggled to compete with the Underground when it opened as a campus bar and music venue. And in the ’40s, colonial-style East Side homes lined the quaint streets where Wriston Quad now stands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Just as these places change with time, so do our traditions. The Young Communist League once gathered a thousand students in a “Dance, Dance, Revolution” conga line to protest Bush and “world order in general.” Zeta Delta Xi hosted its annual spaghetti party, Spagfest, during Spring Weekends of the late 2000’s. The Herald’s kickball games with our College Hill rival, The Indy, were once the “Greeze Bowl,” a football matchup against WBRU.

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Institutional memory is a funny thing. Every four years, Brown’s population turns over entirely — it’s no wonder that so many of these memories are lost along the way. But somehow, certain time-honored traditions remain: Spring Weekend. The midnight organ concert. Passing through the Van Wickle Gates. And at organizations like The Herald, upperclassmen teach underclassmen to be the leaders that they were.

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Last February, a month into my tenure as managing editor of The Herald, we received a visit from Sudeep Reddy, who held my position at the paper two decades ago. He paced around the office — a place where he spent hundreds of hours of his college career, as did the editors before him, as do the editors now. He smiled when he spotted our “slug board” — where the staff keeps track of the stories in the next day’s paper.

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“You still have this?” he asked. “I made this!”

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I had never really thought of The Herald existing without the slug board — how else would editors have organized their work throughout the night? And yet, all those practices that seem woven into the fabric of the institution, were at one time the idea of a single student, given permanency by those who came after.

I have been thinking about my legacy at this university, and if anything I’ve made here will stay around after I leave through the Van Wickle gates. My friends joke that my legacy is cemented in the words I’ve written in this paper. It’s true — one day, maybe, a student flipping through the archives will read articles with my byline. The stories I’ve told will form an understanding of our time for students 10, 20, 30 years from now.

But I think it’s a different question that’s beneath all that: is my time here special?

I sometimes imagine all of the monuments on this campus I would erect if I could: next to the tree on Charlesfield, a monument to my first kiss during Summer@Brown. At the carrels on the third floor of the Rock looking out over University Hall, a monument to the place I finished my series on <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/series/mind-the-gaps/">mental health</a>. In the back office of The Herald, the site of 127’s hardest conversations, a monument to where I cried and argued and laughed with Lauren on too many late nights to recall.

I could map a million overlapping memories under my favorite tree on the Main Green, overlay the silhouettes of countless students hunched over theses at the John Hay. But these places aren’t mine. They can’t be claimed with monuments. If we all got to erect our little monuments — the campus would be littered with them. This place has held layers and layers of memories for the last 250 years for people before and after us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

When I read The Herald’s archives, the faces and names change, but the places don’t. At least, not fundamentally. While my writing may offer some permanent record of our time here, Brown itself is a palimpsest: a manuscript constantly rewritten by the thousands of people that pass through it every four years. Their ambitions, their friendships, their monuments that sometimes brush up against my own.

The word “fugue” can mean two things: a state of losing your identity, usually linked to leaving your usual environment; or a melody introduced in one part of a musical composition and then interwoven successively through the rest of the piece. As I leave Brown, I’m starting to wonder if the two definitions can be connected. That, even as I leave some of my identity behind on Brown’s campus, perhaps those parts will endure. They will be picked up by someone else during their time here — the writers who have taken my spot at the office, the editor 10 years from now who, on a late night in The Herald, flips through the 2018 bound volumes and finds this piece — and they will be strung back into the composition of the campus. The song plays on and on and on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A magazine cover inspired me to change my concentration from the sciences to the humanities. Had someone told me then, as a freshman, I would never have believed it. But here I am, more satisfied than ever with my decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

I started Brown set on concentrating in health and human biology. As soon as I came to campus, I began the race toward medical school. Though I had never gotten lower than an A- in high school, I quickly found myself struggling to keep up with Brown’s rigorous math and science courses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>

At the end of the year, after hardly passing my classes, I went to University Chaplain Janet Cooper Nelson, my academic advisor, desperate for help. I frantically asked her about pre-med courses, retaking classes and switching majors. Instead of giving me answers, she presented me with two questions: “What are your academic interests? What do you like to do?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Her questions caught me off guard. That was the first time I had actually thought about what I wanted. The whole time, I had been trying to do what I thought would impress my parents and my friends back home. I never had concrete reasons for pursuing pre-med; it just seemed like the reputable thing to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

“Do you want to do science for another seven years?” Janet asked me. I froze up as I thought back to all the courses I had taken so far. Math, biology, chemistry — I hated all of them. I distinctly remember sitting in Calculus, drawing pictures of the student in front of me because I was so bored by the content. I would rush<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>through my dreaded three-hour long chemistry labs and leave without collecting the proper data. The thought of dragging myself through even more science and math classes for another seven years seemed absolutely unbearable to me. I shook my head.

“Okay, so were there any classes you took that were not in science that you enjoyed?” she pressed further. I racked my brain for what felt like hours, but I couldn’t think of anything.

Then, as I looked over at the table next to me, I saw a magazine with Juanes, one of my favorite Latinx singers, on the cover. That’s when it hit me: Spanish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Spanish had fascinated me since high school. I enjoyed learning a new language and culture. Though my maternal grandfather is from Puerto Rico, my mother has lost touch with her Spanish, as well as her father, so studying Spanish also felt like a way to recover the language and my Latinx heritage. Talking to Janet, I realized that more than anything else, I wanted to continue this immersion. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>My sophomore fall, I started fresh. I enrolled in an upper level Spanish literature course and began to tentatively pursue Hispanic studies. I also enrolled in a studio art course, a Latin American studies seminar and a psychology course.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Throughout the semester, I grappled with conflicting feelings of contentment and anxiety surrounding my identity. For once, I actually enjoyed my schoolwork. I found overlaps between my courses and got to know my professors — a nearly impossible task in STEM lectures. But the constant disapproving emails from my parents begging me to reconsider STEM, frequent judgement from my peers and the ambiguity surrounding the career applications of my new major made me want to rethink my choices. Was I making progress or moving backwards?

By the end of the semester, with the support of my friends and a lot of soul-searching, I was beginning to make up my mind. I knew I wasn’t a science kid, but I wasn’t a humanities kid either. In fact, it was those very labels that were making my journey so difficult in the first place, labels that Brown encourages students to break down.

In retrospect, my approach had been all wrong. For so long, I had been looking to fit in by doing pre-med, when I really should have been looking to stand out by doing what I truly enjoyed. By the end of my second year, I realized I was my own breed of student, with a mixture of interests and hobbies, ranging from mental health activism to salsa music to weight lifting. I liked singing in the shower and writing essays for fun. My future held grad school or law school or study abroad. Or maybe something completely different. I didn’t necessarily fit in a specific niche or have a concrete plan — and that was okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Today, four years after walking through the Van Wickle gates the first time, I will not graduate with a science degree as I intended. Instead, I will emerge from Brown as a student proud to have studied abroad in Spain, written for The Herald, tutored and completed a thesis about my family heritage. My journey through Brown may have started off shaky and taken me in a completely unexpected direction, but I wouldn’t change it if I had the chance.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My apartment building’s superintendent is the most reliable man in my life right now. Paul is an employee of Mitrelis Enterprises, a business housed in the basement of our building. Our landlord, Andy Mitrelis, is an 88-year-old Greek man who owns eight properties in Rhode Island, a mix of residential and commercial buildings, along with a handful of restaurants, including Andreas and Paragon on Thayer Street.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

A crucial player behind the scenes of this aging real estate mogul’s business operations is Paul. With his thin frame and soft Syrian accent, he drives Mr. Mitrelis to the office every day and then comes and goes from the house as he tends to various odd jobs. His chief responsibility, as he happily explained to me, is to respond to all of the calls for repairs and maintenance at Mitrelis’s properties. In other words, he’s the super. The first time I experienced his excellent service was back in September, when we had a bit of an urgent problem that needed fixing. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

One of the many fun things about living in an old house is the equally old pipes. Moving into our apartment unit this past fall, we quickly learned that, with regular use, our toilet clogged, on average, once every two days. The first time this happened, I tried to plunge and flush the problem away before finally caving and texting Paul. He arrived within an hour, grinning widely, and explained to me that these pipes required a solution far larger than a plunger: the snake. A long, winding, metal contraption that extends down into the pipe, the snake reaches farther than a household plunger. The snake lives in the basement office, and only Paul knows how to use it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Paul suggested we throw our toilet paper away rather than flushing it, but we eventually settled on a happy medium: septic-safe toilet paper, the single-ply tissue that is minimally absorbent, the stuff that they stock the dorm hall bathrooms with here at Brown. In this way, we brought a memory of on-campus living into our off-campus life, square by scratchy square.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

If we painstakingly make sure that septic-safe toilet paper is the only paper product getting flushed down our toilet, it only clogs about once a month, which is luxuriously infrequent. And every four or five weeks, when the bowl’s water level rises, Paul dutifully arrives with a smile on his face and the snake in his hand. “We just want you to be happy,” he always says on his way out, the task quickly put behind him. The house’s rag-tag plumbing is almost kind of nice because it brings this father figure into our home, someone who is here to help us and make us feel safe, an adult who knows how to fix problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>

We learned that Paul’s service is truly around the clock when, during a windstorm this winter, our power went out at around 2 a.m. When the lights zapped to black, my roommates and I huddled together in the dark living room, and, of course, I called Paul. He would know what to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

He picked up after a few rings, and my first question was whether or not I had woken him. “No,” he lied as he cleared his throat, patiently asking what was wrong. I explained the problem at hand, and in return, his first question was whether or not we had called National Grid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

College sometimes feels like this experiment where a bunch of children are set loose and everyone just hopes for the best. So no, Paul, we hadn’t called National Grid. That thought hadn’t even crossed our minds. I politely thanked him for picking up the phone so late at night and said I would call the National Grid and text him with any updates. He wished me luck and said goodnight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Unlike Paul, National Grid was no help. I didn’t even get to speak with a real human. The recording let me know<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>service would be restored in the area within one to eight hours. So there was nothing to do but wait.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Fearing we would be powerless indefinitely, my roommates and I began to worry that all the food in the fridge would go bad. The obvious solution was to eat it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Making my way through my third slice of American cheese, I shrieked when the lights flashed back on. I had sort of accepted that it wouldn’t happen anytime soon, so it came as a great shock when our little universe restored its balance so quickly. When the lights came on, we saw ourselves: three girls, sitting around the kitchen table, eating cheese and ice cream and deli meat with no abandon. I texted Paul the wonderful news. We all slept well that night.

College is strange for a number of reasons, one of them being that you move every year for four years, each time reconstructing a new sense of home. The tapestries and fairy lights get unboxed and re-hung, old and new roommates settle into each other’s daily routines. You carve out a particular route home from class until the motions become automatic, all in time for the year to end and you to pack it all up and move on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

As my fourth and final year of college comes to a close and yet another phase of change barrels towards me, questions of home remain in the forefront of my mind. On top of this, there is the question of what will become of the large plot of land directly behind our house, stretching all the way up the block, where seven multi-family homes once stood. Brown bought the lots in July 2014 and <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/01/28/university-to-build-temporary-brook-st-parking-lot/">razed the structures</a>, making way for a temporary parking lot.

I can only imagine that the University would be interested in buying Mitrelis’s property as well, which would allow the University to eliminate the last hodge-podge, multi-family home on the block and incorporate the land into development plans for the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/25/university-seeks-approval-construct-new-wellness-dorm/">proposed wellness dorm</a> at 450 Brook Street, a project already slated to eventually replace the parking lot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Throughout my time as a news reporter and inquisitive student at Brown University, I have developed a complicated relationship with this school. Firstly, I have loved my time here and feel such a connection to my peers and teachers, and I understand why, as an institution, the University wants to expand. I wish that more people could experience the magic of this school. But this wish loses some of its clarity when I realize the cost of the school’s growth, when I run up against the questions of local displacement around which Brown so carefully tiptoes.

I do agree that more housing is needed for students living on campus, and the proposal to integrate health services into dormitory spaces is a progressive innovation. And space on College Hill, particularly around Thayer Street, is limited. It’s a reality that we all have to face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

At the same time, I can’t help but wonder what happens to people like Paul as Mitrelis Enterprises continues shrinking. I hope that, if Brown decides to use the property for a health and wellness dorm, whoever lives in the space has a support system as loving as the one I experienced in this home. Ultimately, whatever becomes of this land, I will remember it as it is today: an ugly blue house with bad pipes and an excellent super, a home that made my time at college forever sweeter.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">The Democratic National Committee took a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dnc-fossil-fuel-donations_us_5b6dddd4e4b0530743c9ca67">critical step</a> here in Providence this past June, passing a resolution that banned political contributions from the fossil fuel industry, namely oil, gas and coal companies and their associations. The need for such a resolution was meant to address the industry’s history of using political donations and lobbying to spread discord concerning the validity of climate science. With <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/">deliberate misinformation campaigns</a> dating back to the 1970s, they were engaging in fake news before the term existed.</p>
<p class="p3">It is therefore disheartening to see the DNC, led by Watson Senior Fellow Tom Perez ’83 P’18, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dnc-fossil-fuel-donations_us_5b6dddd4e4b0530743c9ca67">walk that commitment back</a> last month with a confusingly worded decision to allow contributions from fossil fuel industry workers and “employers’ political action committees.” While the resolution seemingly aims to allow the ordinary worker to contribute, its phrasing leaves the door wide open for top executives to pour money into the DNC through their own PACs, exactly the flood of dirty money that the June decision was passed to avoid.</p>
<p class="p3">Every year, fossil fuel companies and their trade groups spend around <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oil-companies-climate-policy_us_570bb841e4b0142232496d97">$115 million</a> to shut down efforts to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. For comparison, the gun lobby, which is notorious for using political spending to doom common sense initiatives with broad popular support, spent just $10 million in 2014. When future generations look back at our inaction during the decades when catastrophe could have been avoided, this spending will stand out as damning evidence of our guilt. And to be sure, it has been money well spent for the industry. Since former President Obama’s election in 2008, Republican lawmakers have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/us/politics/republican-leaders-climate-change.html">abandoned any attempt</a> to cut emissions, following a concerted effort by fossil fuel titans like David and Charles Koch to compel them to block any regulations of the industry — or else face a primary challenge from someone who would. They elevated climate skeptics onto a level playing field with the 97 percent of scientists who agree that human-caused warming is occurring. In fact, they have been so successful in this effort that only <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/the-politics-of-climate/">13 percent</a> of conservative Republicans — and, distressingly, 27 percent of American adults — believe humans are the key cause of climate change.</p>
<p class="p3">The close links between the fossil fuel industry and politics haven’t just been used to throw wrenches into climate science. The industry is reliant upon political favor for its very survival. The Trump administration and other conservatives love to malign the subsidies that renewable energy sources like solar and wind received under Obama and his predecessors, such as the <a href="https://www.energysage.com/solar/cost-benefit/solar-investment-tax-credit/">Investment Tax Credit</a>, which is set to expire for residential taxpayers in 2021. All told, the renewable energy industry receives <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/10/6/16428458/us-energy-coal-oil-subsidies">$5.6 billion</a> in temporary subsidies annually, which, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2017/08/23/fa4a506a-883e-11e7-a50f-e0d4e6ec070a_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.ae3ba01d8fde">according to detractors like Energy Secretary Rick Perry</a>, “hav(e) a large impact on the functioning of markets, and thereby challeng(e) our power generation mix.” These free-market conservatives feel much more at ease, however, when it comes to the $20.5 billion that oil, coal and gas industries receive each year at the federal and state level, $7.4 billion of which comes from permanent subsidies that have been around for decades — in some cases up to a century. While many of these subsidies originated before the link between fossil fuels and climate change was as robust as it is now, and while there are compelling reasons to ensure a stable national energy supply, it is clear that the fossil fuel industry is being propped up by much-needed government money, while a clean and safe alternative is within reach.</p>
<p class="p3">Proponents of the DNC decision are framing the issue fundamentally as one of labor rights, an attempt to ensure that ordinary energy workers and their unions can participate in the democratic process. This is an unfortunate continuation of a long-running scheme to pit the working class and climate activists against each other in a way that ultimately benefits fossil fuel executives at the expense of the planet. Given that the decision leaves a loophole for PACs, it is exceedingly likely that the bulk of donations stemming from the reversal of this ban will come not from ordinary workers, but from top leadership. Ultimately, the needs of labor are aligned with the goals of the climate movement. As Guy Ryder, director-general of the UN’s International Labour Organization, <a href="http://time.com/5365422/democratic-party-fossil-fuel-contributions-labor/">put it last month</a>, “There are no jobs on a dead planet.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the same time, transitioning away from an economy that runs on fossil fuels will create tens of thousands of new jobs in energy, infrastructure, agriculture and other industries in what is becoming known as the “Green New Deal.”</p>
<p class="p3">Over a thousand Democrats currently running for federal, state and local office have made individual <a href="http://nofossilfuelmoney.org/pledge-signers/">pledges</a> not to accept any fossil fuel money. That’s an encouraging start and yet another indication that the party momentum heading into the November midterm elections is coming from the grassroots. It would be a mistake for a DNC that is already struggling to maintain currency to find itself siding with an outdated and destructive industry.</p>
<p class="p3">Quite frankly, a party committed to the well-being of future generations, to protecting vulnerable populations from the ravages of human-induced disasters, to the triumph of truth over oil-slicked fiction must turn away money that is derived from the processes that threaten those aims most. It is no secret — despite what a decades-long misinformation campaign would have you believe — that burning fossil fuels and increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is changing the climate. The effects of these changes can already be seen, and yet they have the potential, without timely action, to go beyond what we can conceive.</p>
<p class="p3">It is also no secret that the fossil fuel era has created great wealth along with technological advances for every citizen of industrialized nations. But though we have all shared the benefits, and therefore all bear the onus for averting the worst of the costs, no one has more to lose at this stage than the fossil fuel executives whose income streams are at risk. It would only be rational self-preservation for them to put their political donations to work to preserve their industries. In making it clear that these funds should have no place in our political process, the DNC must pursue its own rational self-preservation — for party and for planet.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the start of the semester, I visited Health Services for my annual screen for sexually transmitted infections. Before going to the lab, my doctor asked me to call my insurance provider to make sure Lifespan labs — where Health Services sends patients’ bloodwork and other samples — was “in-network,” and to make sure they covered STI screenings. Apparently, some private insurance plans don’t cover STI tests unless the patient has symptoms. If my insurance didn’t cover an STI screen, I was told tests were pricey, about $100 each. In addition, I was told that since I’m on my parents’ insurance plan, the screening might show up on my parents’ <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/health/services/promotion/general-health-health-care-sexual-health-stis/sti-testing-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>. Luckily, my family has comprehensive health care that covers regular STI screenings, and I could text my mom a heads-up that an STI test might show up on the insurance statement, which was mildly awkward, but not a big deal. But many students are not as fortunate and may not get tested as a result. The University can and should address this issue by providing free STI testing for students whose insurance won’t pay, and for students who cannot use their family insurance for STI tests without serious repercussions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though some private insurance companies will not cover STI screenings if patients do not exhibit symptoms, many STIs can be asymptomatic but still <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sexually-transmitted-diseases-stds/in-depth/std-symptoms/art-20047081" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contagious</a> and, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications including <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-could-happen-if-i-dont-get-tested-for-stds-3132741" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infertility</a>. Thus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/screeningreccs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommends</a> that women under 25 be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea once a year, and that gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men be tested for syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea once a year on top of regular HIV tests. Clearly, the way insurance handles STIs doesn’t match how STIs actually spread, according to CDC guidance. Until health insurance catches up to reality, the University can and should fill this critical gap.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown students already pay a $443 <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/health/services/fees-and-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Health Services fee</a> every semester. At peer schools like Dartmouth, Cornell and Harvard, the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>health fee is used to make STI testing free for all students. Other schools, like Princeton, heavily subsidize STI testing for students with private insurance; chlamydia and gonorrhea tests cost <a href="https://uhs.princeton.edu/using-our-services/costs-billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9.50 each</a>. At Yale, students receive free STI tests regardless of whether they pay an optional <a href="https://yalehealth.yale.edu/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specialty care fee</a>. Yet, while Health Services does offer free HIV tests and subsidizes safer sex supplies, other STI tests are not covered under the health services fee, leaving some students without access to crucial STI screening.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Some may worry that including STI screenings will necessarily increase the health services fee for all students. But peer institutions that do cover STI screenings with the student health fee do not necessarily have higher fees. The student health fee is $91 per quarter at Dartmouth, $185 per semester at Cornell and $589 per semester at Harvard. Total student fees are $465 per semester at Princeton. Furthermore, if the University encourages students who can use private health insurance to pay for STI screening to do so, this would partially defray the cost of STI tests incurred by the University.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the end, access to regular STI screenings is a crucial part of maintaining sexual health. By age 25, one in two sexually active people will get an STI. But, while people aged 15 to 24 account for nearly 10 million STI cases every year, only 12 percent of this age group got tested in the <a href="http://www.ashasexualhealth.org/stdsstis/statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a>. In Rhode Island specifically, newly diagnosed cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis have increased sharply in the past 10 years, hitting a 10-year high <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170926/std-cases-in-rhode-island-hit-10-year-high" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2017</a>. To prioritize student health and wellbeing, the University should make STI screenings as accessible as possible.</span></p>

		<title>Vilsan &#039;19: Best friends forever?</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/11/vilsan-19-best-friends-forever/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of us spent the early part of our childhoods making friendship bracelets for playground buddies, only to watch those friendships fizzle within months of the symbolic union. Whether it was because of distance, different social circles or being seated apart in homeroom for too many years in a row, few of us still wear those bracelets today. College is supposed to be different — we’re wiser, older and our parents don’t have to arrange our play dates anymore. As seniors head into their final year at Brown, many are optimistic that college friendships truly do last forever. In spite of pessimistic research that suggests maintaining relationships becomes more challenging with age, college friendships continue to endure the test of time. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">College friendships are a wonderful petri dish. Unlike family, we choose them. Unlike romantic relationships, they are unencumbered by structure. Unlike professional relationships, they lack formality and allow us to show our true selves. At the end of the day, they enhance our college experiences. It would be a pity to give up on them so easily come graduation. In fact, we have reason to fight for our collegiate relationships and hope they survive, for our health, if not for the camaraderie. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Distance is perhaps the biggest obstacle for aspiring BFFs. Even with the boom of social media and video conferencing, nothing quite replaces face-to-face conversation. Research shows that, on average, <a href="https://www.livescience.com/1777-study-college-friends-stay-close.html">Americans move every five years</a>, which is terrible news if you believe in the saying “out of sight, out of mind.” And while distance does make adult friendships considerably more challenging, it is by no means a death sentence. If you continue to share mutual interests and be present in each other’s lives, distance becomes a mere inconvenience So, as you begin your job search, you can rest easy in knowing that the city you choose doesn’t have to dictate the friendships you maintain. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Unsurprisingly, the long-term success of relationships depends heavily on how close your relationship was in the first place. A study of friendships from 1983 to 2002 found that lifelong friends had solidified their bond early on. It turns out, those inside jokes and spring break memories are more than just anecdotes — a shared past is key in building a strong foundation for your friendship. So, the next time you feel guilty for procrastinating on a midterm paper to spend some quality time with your buddies, know that you are investing the time necessary to cement your relationships when it matters most.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">As if it weren’t already self-evident, countless surveys demonstrate the importance of friendships to our overall happiness. The cliche “money can’t buy happiness” continues to ring true, with <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/20322621/ns/health-childrens_health/t/youths-stuff-happiness-may-surprise-parents/#.ViUIXLRViko">respondents citing</a> relationships as the most important factor in their lives, without even mentioning their finances. As seniors, many of us are actively job hunting and focusing on our financial futures more than ever. Don’t let the hunt keep you from nurturing and building on your relationships. In a materialistic and often tragic world, we can count on our friends to stand by our sides. If we lose sight of what is truly important, we risk leading a lonely and unfulfilled life, regardless of what can be found in our bank accounts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Strong friendships are similarly essential to a healthy lifestyle. According to the Mayo Clinic, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/friendships/art-20044860">research shows</a> that friendships surpass familial relationships in predicting health as people age. A strong support group can help you recover from trauma, encourage you to abandon unhealthy behavior and reduce your stress. Though family is undoubtedly instrumental in guiding you through difficult times, adults with a strong social network tend to have reduced risks of significant health problems. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">As college students, sometimes it seems as though our friends come and go in cycles — our elementary friends are buried somewhere deep in our memories and our high school friends haunt our yearbooks, so it only makes sense that our college friends will be the next victims in a long parade of exes. But there is reason be optimistic about collegiate relationships. Not only are these friendships the most likely to last, but they are instrumental to your health and happiness. Forget the days when your group of friends was harshly dismissed as a social distraction when you brought back a disappointing grade. As your life becomes crowded with other worries and responsibilities, be it family or work, it is important to continue letting your friends distract you in the best possible ways.</span></p>

		<title>Calvelli &#039;19: Shop for classes like you shop at Lowe’s</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Shopping period” has always struck me as being too consumerist a term, too readily embracing a transactional conception of education. An education has to be earned, not bought. But, because my philosophical objection won’t get the University to rename its long-standing tradition, my only option was to double down on the term we’re given. That’s why I now think we should shop for classes like we’re shopping at Lowe’s. (Or if you prefer Home Depot, fine. As long as it’s a home improvement store, we’re on the same page.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this point, you might be thinking: Lowe’s? Really? When’s the last time I even went to a Lowe’s, let alone thought of it as a model for my college education? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those are reasonable questions. (Though it’s unreasonable to go more than two weeks without visiting a Lowe’s.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indeed, to many students, shopping period might seem more like shopping at Amazon. There are innumerable choices, you add items to a “cart” that always gets too big and the reviews never seem to match the product.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or maybe students see class shopping as akin to clothes shopping. You try a bunch of things on, see how they fit and then buy what you think you need to round out your wardrobe.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The clothes shoppers are on to something, especially regarding ‘fit’: You want your clothes, like your classes, to go well together, to be distinct from what you already have and to be a reflection of yourself. But there’s still something missing in the analogy. Clothes get grown out of, they go out of style and their importance is somewhat superficial. Courses, on the other hand, can inspire lifelong learning, touch on eternal themes and carry intrinsic value.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fortunately, shopping-as-Lowe’s presents no such conundra. At a home improvement store, you’re tasked with designing and furnishing the place you live — a beacon of steadiness and stability in your life. Lowe’s is neither transient nor trendy, not the kind of place you’d buy some gadget like a whipping siphon that you use once to impress a girl and then forget about.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In class and at Lowe’s, you’re looking to build a foundation for the rest of your life, an academic and personal home base. Accents and complements, installations and frameworks — those are what an effective shopping period gets you. First, you should install your floor, choosing the core classes on which you can build. Then you can find an accent rug, a course that highlights new dimensions of your academic interests. And to round things out, perhaps you should invest in a bit of wall art, a course that is all your own and explores new passions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And if you don’t study interior design at the Rhode Island School of Design and all this decorating sounds like too tall a task, don’t fret: Lowe’s associates (aka Meiklejohns, advisors and peers) can help you choose the right products — classes — for the job of educating yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even with this assistance, though, the ultimate task of homebuilding falls on you, the shopper. Sadly, just imagining going to Lowe’s won’t fill your cart with the perfect batch of courses for the semester (but it will remind you of how desperately you need a new shower curtain). So, what’s the practical advice that’s hiding somewhere in this simile?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s that courses don’t exist in a vacuum, and you should consider how each semester’s classes fit into the scope of your education. When evaluating classes, people normally ask questions like: Is this class interesting? Will I enjoy taking it? By the Lowes-ian approach, however, the questions should be: How does this class help me reach my educational goals? Will it create a foundation for future learning or shine new light on a topic I’ve already studied? Does this class fill a gap in my intellectual portfolio? Et cetera.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Answering these questions is undoubtedly harder than choosing classes whose Courses@Brown descriptions most catch your eye. Yet doing so is still vital. The classes you shop for (and ultimately take) ripple through far more than just the two weeks of shopping period. College courses — whether by virtue of the content or of the best friend you might meet in your seminar — can create the foundation for lifelong learning and knowledge. That’s the privilege of shopping period: We’re given time to explore the consequential choices that comprise an academic career and ensure they’re the right ones.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So, if you think of your courses as nothing more than little gizmos that make Jeff Bezos rich, then shop with a short-term outlook, focusing only on immediate pleasure or interest. But if you want to see every class you take as contributing to a wider and more meaningful educational experience, take the time to shop with a long-term, “home-improvement” view, recognizing that a college experience well-spent can be a launching pad to a life of meaning.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the Lowe’s motto goes, “never stop improving.” Whether you’re furnishing your dorm room or deciding how best to broaden your mind, these words will never fail as a guide. And if this article has inspired you to go to Lowe’s, do me a favor and return my wood paint stain. I got dark walnut instead of ebony, and it’s really ruined the aesthetic of my computer table.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The past two years have been fraught for Democrats. In the aftermath of the calamitous 2016 presidential election, ideological fissures within the party have widened as progressive insurgents have found traction in recent months. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in 2016 portended a wave of challenges to establishment candidates from the left, and many ensuing primaries at both the state and national level have pitted progressive challengers against comparatively centrist, moderate incumbents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In Rhode Island, the upcoming Democratic gubernatorial primary captures this ideological tension. The primary, for which polls close today at 8 p.m., features incumbent Gov. Gina Raimondo, one of just six female governors currently in office, against former State Rep. Spencer Dickinson and former Secretary of State Matt Brown. Brown, who is running a campaign from the left, was seen as a rising star in 2003 when he was elected secretary of state at just 32 years old. However, his career was derailed after his 2006 Senate campaign flamed out amid accusations of <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11995594/ns/politics/t/critics-see-money-laundering-senate-race/#.W5gjKJNKhuU">money laundering.</a> (Brown, ironically, had made transparent campaign finance a platform issue.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His critiques of Raimondo typify those of progressive challengers; Brown’s ad campaign has fixated on portraying the sitting governor as a “Republican in disguise,” <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180816/matt-brown-ad-brands-raimondo-as-republican-in-disguise">the Providence Journal reported</a>. In the realm of policy, Brown has centered his platform around “Medicare for All”; he has pledged that on his first day in office, he would move Rhode Island to a “universal health care system,” thus “lowering average costs for people and businesses in the state.” Sanders, notably, proposed a “Medicare for All” program at the federal level, and many special elections candidates have won recent races while making the proposal a campaign issue — Brown’s embrace of the plan further affirms his progressive bona fides. There is also a political advantage here, as Sanders carried Rhode Island by approximately 11 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in the presidential primaries, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/primaries/rhode-island">New York Times reported</a>. In many ways, the upcoming gubernatorial primary resembles its presidential precedent — a progressive male insurgent running against a centrist, female establishment candidate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Surely, progressive voters in Rhode Island will take issue with Raimondo’s $191 million in cuts to Medicaid — which Brown has made sure to highlight — along with her rollback of pension benefits. However, Brown’s attacks on Raimondo’s pension cuts fail to acknowledge the economic context in which they occurred. In Raimondo’s first year as treasurer in 2011, the state’s unemployment rate was hovering around 11 percent. To curb losses, Raimondo instituted reforms that shifted state employees to hybrid pension plans, which balanced the budget but exposed employees to investment risk. She also boosted the retirement age and suspended cost-of-living adjustments. Though state unemployment now hovers around 4 percent, “the Democratic left hasn’t forgiven her,” according to an opinions piece in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/primaries/rhode-island">Wall Street Journal. </a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recently, Raimondo has boosted funding for community colleges and enacted legislation mandating that employers provide paid sick leave, two policies that allign with progressive ideology. But these reforms have been undermined by her persistent courting of corporations. When Raimondo approved a $34 million grant to General Dynamics for its construction work, Brown was highly critical. In an email to the Providence Journal, Brown wrote: “Why do Rhode Island taxpayers need to give $34 million in subsidies to General Dynamics … which made $30 billion in revenue last year and paid its CEO <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-democratic-reformer-tries-to-hang-on-in-new-england-1536356034">$21 million in 2016?”</a> Raimondo’s positions on health care, pension reform and the granting of corporate tax breaks are untenable among more liberal Democrats — at least when she’s running against Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This primary, then, sits at the crossroads of the two dominant movements within the current Democratic party: the burgeoning progressive wing and the widespread success of female candidates. Some primary outcomes — Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez’s primary victory in New York’s District 14 comes to mind — embody both of these narratives. But across the gamut of primaries this year, there is far more reason to believe that 2018 is the year for female Democrats, not necessarily progressives. An August study published by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-primaries-candidates-demographics/">FiveThirtyEight</a> of Democratic primaries found that in 138 races, female candidates had a 65 percent win rate; “all else being equal, being a woman has been worth an additional 10 percentage points over being a man in the open Democratic primaries we looked at.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By contrast, the possibility of a progressive takeover of the party from establishment Democrats has not been realized, despite what dramatic headlines may suggest. “Establishment” candidates — those that get endorsed by either the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s Red to Blue List or the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — have a 95 percent win rate in<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-establishment-is-beating-the-progressive-wing-in-democratic-primaries-so-far/"> 2018.</a> Isolate that to cases where a party-endorsed candidate ran against a progressive-group-endorsed candidate, and the “establishment” candidate still won 89 percent of the time. Indeed, the best predictor of success in Democratic primaries remains the support of the Democratic party itself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At a macro level, the political atmosphere seems to augur success for Raimondo. It’s also promising that former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed her this week; of the ten candidates Biden has endorsed this cycle, every one has won his or her race. But while Brown is widely considered a long-shot, Raimondo’s campaign seems particularly worried about him. It spent $1.3 million over the summer and released a comprehensive attack ad on Brown, zeroing in on his alleged money laundering. Raimondo seems likely to stave off Brown’s primary challenge, but her support among the Democratic left will be critical in deciding the general election. Her likely opponent is Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, who lost by just four points against Raimondo in 2014. The internal polling conducted by both campaigns shows Fung ahead as of late August, and his net favorability amongst Rhode Islanders sits at a sturdy plus-25 points, compared to <a href="https://www.wpri.com/politics/wpri-12rwu-poll-raimondo-fung-still-in-tight-race-for-ri-governor/1349587973">Raimondo’s negative two.</a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ultimately, Raimondo will likely win her primary, even without the support of the Democratic left. But it will be vital to consolidate her base in the general election, lest she lose the race to a Republican who would be far less palatable to every bloc of Rhode Island Democrats.</span></p>

		<title>Okin &#039;19: Let’s change the way we think of self-care</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My most resolute commitment this summer was to dutifully neglect my glasses as much as possible. I read, I scroll, I write emails, yet — against the constant pleading of my mom —I disregard the brown frames that sit somewhere in my room.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When I first got the prescription for my reading glasses freshmen year, the optometrist revealed to me that there is a connection between fatigue and not wearing your glasses. You use energy performing those weird squinty gestures when you aren’t peering through the altered lens. It makes you tired. I was tired a lot of the time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Meanwhile, I spent much of my time catastrophizing everything that comes after College Hill. A particularly dark image includes me, a fifty-foot cliff and only my English degree to soften the fall. I read (articles about the job prospects for liberal arts students), I scroll (Handshake job openings), I write emails (to all the BrownConnect contacts in the directory). Most of the time, I do these things sans glasses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It took all summer, but ultimately I came to understand the necessity of living life through my lenses, and it’s already alleviating my fatigue. Yet, there is an irony apparent in my simultaneous glasses-neglecting and future-tripping: I’m neglecting something that could improve my current well-being while obsessing over how to guarantee a happy future. Now, I don’t intend on using this column to debate the value of over-thinking life post-Van Wickle Gates or that of dismissing the present for worries about the future. Rather, the irony I found actually presented a new conception of self-care, one that I can confidently get behind this year. What if we stopped thinking of self-care as a break from pursuing our goals and instead saw it as a vital ingredient in our overall success and well-being? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Self-care, as it currently stands, represents the idea of taking moments of escape from stressful situations to preserve one’s well-being. A quick Google search associates the term with the active endeavors of “<a href="http://www.thelawofattraction.com/self-care-tips/">stepping back</a>,” “<a href="http://www.fgwrc.ca/uploads/ck/files/Resources/Factsheets/FactSheetSelfCare.pdf">taking the time</a>,” and engaging in a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/fashion/post-election-anxiety-self-care.html?_r=0">daily practice</a>”. It’s no wonder that the suggestion of self-care on a SciLi night stacked with assignments is typically met with an eye-roll: How can we reconcile the time demands of self-care while ignoring the pile of work in front of us that needs to get done?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It took the very literal example of remembering to wear my glasses while searching for jobs online to realize that we should revamp our conception of self-care. Rather than a break from striving toward our goals, caring for ourselves should always been seen as an inextricable step in achieving them. Endeavors such as eating healthier and getting more sleep are not separate from our efforts toward becoming successful CEOs and industry leaders. Instead, they are a part of getting us there. By understanding self-care as a essential component in the process of achieving our aspirations, we allow ourselves the chance to actually realize our dreams. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This isn’t to say we should indulge in a Netflix binge whenever we have a big work night ahead of us. In fact, we need to dismiss the pampering notion of self-care in order to take it seriously as a necessary element of our work. If we differentiate the concept of taking care of oneself versus overindulging (which is certainly okay at times), perhaps we will be more willing to recognize its critical importance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Simply, permitting “self-care” a substantive place in our to-do lists toward our goals means that we approach them as healthier and more attentive individuals, ones who might accomplish and thrive even more in those positions. While we cannot prepare for the exact obstacles that might come our way, we can prepare our future selves by developing abilities to handle these situations. In slowly implementing vitalizing moments of self-kindness into our schedules, we fortify ourselves with the necessary mental and physical stamina to overcome challenges. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The University recently announced that Michael Steele — former chair of the Republican National Committee, former lieutenant governor of Maryland and conservative political commentator — has been named a faculty fellow at the Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs. Steele will host a not-for-credit study group throughout the semester and will also co-host two public events focused on the midterm elections with current Democratic National Committee Chair <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/08/steele">Tom Perez ’83 P ’18. </a>Reactions to this announcement have been mixed but mostly positive, if the 155 “likes” and 10 “angry reactions” on Facebook at press time are any <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BrownUniversity/posts/10155346323051534?__xts__[0]=68.ARCw4R_2yCQWpqTTsT40fvfJYCMRE74G4U4aQRZFvTh336rrNmc4i_90fL79L8MTwbeGu7_OvNurBfOyR86jzjvP8P0zdE4mr2v4q2L_RymsLzbDBUVzB0QsOkkvnptp_9JPPn7d1vHJ1ZjhacFHXJ7_xXb2BOxuOTAPpevwStN42a_tr6H_qp4&amp;__tn__=-R">indication.</a> I, for one, am extremely excited for the learning opportunities this invitation presents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Last spring, I wrote a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/13/aman-20-constitutes-acceptable-discourse/">column</a> laying out criteria to determine the boundaries of acceptable discourse on campus. I argued that guest speakers should enhance our learning and should ultimately help us fulfill our mission of “serv(ing) the community, the nation and the world.” To fulfill this mission, students need to be exposed to a diverse array of opinions and perspectives in order to successfully engage with those we will encounter after graduation. In addition, I argued that the University was not bringing enough conservative perspectives to campus, limiting students’ education.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The appointment of Michael Steele as a faculty fellow clearly fulfills these goals. In my previous column, I argued that guest speakers should be able to “share personal experiences and new perspectives that we cannot readily find in the library, on the internet or from our professors.” As a former elected official and the leader of the RNC, Steele clearly meets this criterion. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Furthermore, the structure of Steele’s fellowship offers opportunities for in-depth study as well as more accessible public events. Having the former RNC chair and the current DNC chair on the same stage will hopefully spark thoughtful conversations and provide a positive example of engagement with opposing partisan affiliations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Steele is not without critics — and he will probably be challenged for past commentary and policy advocacy. For example, some might take issue with Steele’s past condemnations of Barack Obama, including his assertion that the war in Afghanistan was one of “Obama’s choosing.” Yet unlike the traditional guest speaker format, the study group and co-hosted events offer significant opportunities for productive conversation and will likely limit false or hyperbolic rhetoric.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is also worth noting that Steele is no longer a leading official in the Republican Party and does not have to indulge or accept rhetoric from the fringes of his party. That is, he can serve as an independent conservative voice on this campus. (This hasn’t always been the case: In 2009, as RNC chairman, Steele criticized conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, calling his rhetoric <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2009/03/steele-to-rush-im-sorry-019517">“incendiary” and “ugly,”</a> but he almost immediately apologized when he faced intense backlash from Limbaugh and his supporters.) In fact, in recent months, Steele has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump. Earlier this year, during an appearance on MSNBC, he was asked if he thought Trump was racist. Steele responded, “At this point, the evidence is incontrovertible, it’s right there.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the University cannot realistically invite every potential guest speaker to be a faculty fellow, in the future, it should strive for this kind of deep engagement when it invites political personalities to campus. If Steele’s appointment is successful, his fellowship could be a model — on this campus and on others that have had more chaotic experiences with right-wing speakers — for inviting conservative figures to campus in a way that will be productive rather than simply divisive. If the goal of inviting guest speakers to campus is enhancing students’ education and introducing us to new ideas, the University should continue to focus on quality over quantity to create meaningful learning experiences for students. </span></p>

		<title>Thomas &#039;21: The wake-up call of the 2018 U.S. Open</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There were a lot of storylines that could have been written following the the 2018 U.S. Open Women’s Singles final. Serena Williams, arguably the greatest tennis player to ever hold a racquet, was looking to win a staggering 24th Grand Slam title and match the all-time Grand Slam record currently held by Margaret Court. This win also would have been Williams’ first Grand Slam after giving birth to her daughter, Olympia, last year. On the other side of the net, rising tennis star Naomi Osaka, enjoying a breakout season, sought to win the first Grand Slam title of her career at only 20 years of age. With a win, Osaka would become the first Haitian-Japanese player to win a Grand Slam. Notably, the final represented a true matchup of student versus teacher — Osaka openly cites Williams as one of her idols. The match promised to be exciting and tremendously significant, no matter the winner. Instead, the aftermath of the controversial final has failed to reflect any of the excitement going into the match. In different ways, it’s as if Williams and Osaka both managed to lose. Indeed, the final of the 2018 U.S. Open and its third set drama demonstrated the experiences of erasure of Williams and Osaka — and brought to mainstream attention the racial prejudice that women competitors of color face throughout their careers, beneath the meritocratic facade of professional sports.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For Williams, the final could not have gone much worse. She received multiple code violations during the match which, ultimately, cost her a game. Williams expressed her frustration not only with her own level of play, but with match umpire Carlos Ramos as well. When speaking with Ramos, Williams said two notable things: “This is not fair,” regarding her penalties, and “You owe me an apology.” In the context of the match, these statements are immediately understandable and reflect Williams’ feelings at the time. But, they also unmistakably speak to her experience at the top of tennis for nearly 20 years. When she and her sister, Venus Williams, first emerged on the tennis scene, they were coached by their outspoken father, Richard Williams. He would openly state that his daughters would go on to become Grand Slam champions, which they did. But at the time he was <a href="https://www.si.com/vault/1999/05/31/8107824/whos-your-daddy-call-richard-williams-what-you-wantbizarre-deceitful-or-perhaps-madbut-be-sure-of-one-thing-he-has-brilliantly-guided-the-careers-and-lives-of-his-daughters-venus-and-serena-the-h">not taken seriously</a>, and was thought to be insane, when other parents’ belief and confidence in their children might be seen as nothing more than supportive. It was as if the Williams sisters weren’t allowed to believe they could succeed at the highest level in a predominantly white sport. Granted, to say that two girls from Compton were going to take over the sport of tennis was a bold statement, but we all saw what happened with that. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Williams’ career matured and she began to assert her dominance on the professional tennis circuit, she has faced an unfair share of criticism surrounding her body and the intensity she brings to every match. A recent comic in Australia’s The Herald Sun — which depicts her as exaggeratedly large, muscular and whiny — illustrates the ways in which Williams is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/world/australia/serena-williams-cartoon-herald-sun-racist.html">demonized</a> for these two exact things. And while her accomplishments and accolades certainly speak to her greatness, they are often marked with an asterisk and <a href="http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/19734541/john-mcenroe-says-serena-williams-no-700-world-played-men-circuit">compared</a> to the accomplishments of her male counterparts to bring her down a notch. Thus, throughout her 20 years at the top of tennis, Serena Williams has had to deal with questions about her ability, attacks against her physique and efforts to discredit her accomplishments. In the 2018 U.S. Open Final, it all seemed to come to a head. Her outbursts were a microcosmic eruption of a career’s worth of frustration. To use Williams’ own words, it’s not fair that she’s had to endure attacks against her and her family, and she is owed an apology for the way she has been treated since she first hit the scene.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For Osaka, the final should have been a dream come true. And it was: Osaka became the first Haitian-Japanese player to win a Grand Slam, though the moment certainly wasn’t what she had dreamt up in her head. And while she’s won the first of what may very well be many more Grand Slams to come, the media has inordinately emphasized only half of her identity. In countless news reports, her Haitian identity is often given just a <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/2018/09/08/osaka-defeats-williams-to-become-1st-japanese-grand-slam-singles-champ/">sentence</a>. The same comic that painted Serena Williams in an overly exaggerated manner also painted Osaka in a much more tame, unassuming manner. In the comic, Osaka has straight, blonde hair, and her skin is very light. Essentially, any semblance of Osaka’s blackness is erased.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The effort to remove traces of black heritage from Osaka’s triumph reflects the larger societal prevalence of anti-blackness. (As far as the comic is concerned, the shades of Williams’ and Osaka’s skin were likely made to contrast so as to reinforce Williams’ role as the aggressor and Osaka as an unfortunate victim.) Osaka should be celebrated for her amazing victory, and the entirety of its significance, including all parts of her identity. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It isn’t as if Osaka herself downplays her Haitian roots. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkX0bjOyNME">press conference</a> held a few weeks ago, a reporter <a href="https://blavity.com/maybe-this-naomi-osaka-family-photo-will-get-reporters-to-finally-stop-ignoring-her-black-heritage">asked</a> Osaka how her Japanese identity and American identity made her who she is today. Osaka responded by first pointing out, “My dad’s Haitian…” Separately, when an interviewer asked Osaka following a match about her Japanese identity, Osaka replied, “I’m honored to represent Japan but my dad’s side is Haitian — so represent.” Even after acquiring one of tennis’ most sought-after prizes, Osaka is subject to harmful social patterns that effectively erase half of who she is.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Williams and Osaka have reached the pinnacle of their sport and been on top of the world. Despite — or perhaps because of — their immense success, these incredible female athletes are still subjected to racism, which might seem as if it would fold against such powerful women. But this has not been the case. Sports give us an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/23/thomas-21-athletes-people/">opportunity</a> to see how things we think about in the abstract, like racism, have real impacts on individual lives, even those of people we might deem heroic. Williams has been in the game for over 20 years and has faced racism at every stage in her career. And now, as the end of her career nears, a new star is on the rise in Osaka, and she’s experiencing a similar phenomenon. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are things that professional tennis associations, like the Women’s Tennis Association, can do to attract more players from more backgrounds to the sport. The <a href="https://www.wtef.org/programs">Washington Tennis and Education Foundation</a> is a nonprofit offering programs in the Washington, D.C. area for children from under-resourced neighborhoods to gain access to academic support and tennis training. The WTEF is an example of a way tennis can demonstrate a commitment to diversity — to including more people of different backgrounds in the game. And, like most professional jobs, umpires should receive substantial diversity training, so that they do not allow ingrained racial biases to impinge upon their professional and athletic judgement. Advancing basic ideas like these could alleviate some of the turmoil great champions like Osaka and Williams have had to endure up to this point.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Certain dorms at Brown are designated as quiet spaces. Certain dorms are sub-free. There’s Environmental Housing and International Housing and, as announced last semester, there are plans to build a somewhat nebulously-defined “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/25/university-seeks-approval-construct-new-wellness-dorm/">wellness dorm</a>.” So, to expand on these offerings, hear me out:</p>
<p class="p2">Cat. Housing.</p>
<p class="p2">Or Pet Housing, I guess, but that name implies that I’m also in support of allowing dog-specific dorms, a point which I’ll address later. Birds, guinea pigs and other small animals that don’t bring up as many allergen concerns should be allowed in all dorms, though that’s an argument for another column. And “Animal Housing” just bears unfortunate connotations that the University would probably prefer to avoid, so “Cat Housing” it shall be.</p>
<p class="p2">I envision one of the residential halls that is composed primarily of suites or apartments, such as Graduate Center or Young Orchard, as a site dedicated for students to keep rabbits, ferrets and especially cats with them on campus. Rooms that share an enclosed common area offer a safe way for these animals to roam around, providing more space than a 100-square-foot single. The resident who brings the pet would be its primary caretaker, taking on the duty of making sure it is cared for during the school year as well as on breaks. Students would have to sign contracts agreeing to take responsibility incurred for any damage that their pet might cause, a step no different from Brown’s pre-existing policy that makes students pay for any harm enacted upon their dorms.</p>
<p class="p2">Detractors of this proposal will, of course, immediately point to students with allergies. However, this ignores the reality that there are already students on Brown’s campus who, for various reasons, have received permission to have animals with them. An allergic student could enter a residence hall without knowing that they may be exposed to the dander that sets them off. Cat Housing would minimize that issue, though not eliminate it ­— students who have documented emotional support animals should not be required to live only in Cat Housing, as that would single them out from students who do not require such feline accommodations.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That said, Cat Housing would actually represent a victory for mental health advocates. There is<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320950.php"> strong evidence</a> for a link between having an animal companion and improved emotional well-being. Moreover, if a student wishes to have an animal with them right now, they must first jump through the hoops of explaining their condition to the University and proving that it is severe enough to warrant exemption from regular pet-free policies. Having dorms designated as animal-friendly would give students the option to have their pets nearby without having to go through the drawn-out, emotionally exhausting process of displaying their mental illnesses for administrative approval.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Even for students without prior mental health concerns, animals provide a break from the daily stresses of life, something Brown has tacitly acknowledged through its Heavy Petting program, in which animals are brought to campus during particularly trying times such as finals and midterms. But, as has been written<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>about <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/04/bohman-18-heavy-petting-consider-dogs-needs/">before</a>, Heavy Petting creates conditions that <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/10/28/tisch-17-consider-the-bunnies-discontinue-super-heavy-petting/">may place stress</a> on the animals, an issue that can be avoided by creating a stable living environment. In fact, as a recent <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/09/10/meet-other-empty-nesters-they-dogs-and-they-missing-kids-too/H5WOrDvWbh3vld9Kg72KPK/story.html">Boston Globe article</a> points out, many animals undergo considerable emotional challenges when a student leaves for college. Cat Housing, then, might benefit both person and pet.</p>
<p class="p2">Though I know from firsthand experience that cats are capable of missing their people, I acknowledge that the Globe column’s canine-centric approach is somewhat tangential to my Cat Housing proposal, as I don’t believe a college is the best environment for a dog. A student busy with academics, work, extracurricular activities and all the other responsibilities of life at Brown would likely have little time to walk or take a dog out to do its business — problems avoided with cats. There are other issues with dogs too, like noise pollution; think about how many times you’ve heard your neighbor’s dog bark. Now consider how many times you’ve heard their cat meow. Sure, people in the same building might hear a cat in the suite below or above them, but complaining about that when you choose to live in Cat Housing is like signing up to Environmental Housing and then getting upset when you smell the compost pile out back. Finally, students seeking to hang out with a dog need only wait around on the Main Green until one of President Christina Paxson’s P’19 poodles appears. Cats are considerably harder to access.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown has long prided itself on being a progressive institution. The formation of Cat Housing, through its implications for human health and animal rights, will keep it deserving of that label. So come on, Brown — let the cats out of the bag, and into the (designated) dorms.</p>

		<title>Johnson &#039;20: Charting your way out of the slump</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to a 2012 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/getting-over-the-sophomore-slump.html">survey</a> conducted by the consulting firm Ruffalo Noel Levitz, a quarter of college sophomores reported that they are not energized by their classes or do not feel at home on their campus. These results are possibly due to a phenomenon called the sophomore slump — a time when sophomores experience a period of confusion and uncertainty — though “slumping” can occur at any time. Most students at Brown have experienced a time when they have had low levels of academic achievement and felt indecisive about their goals and future. While slumping during any year in college can be overwhelming, people can shift their perspective during unpredictable moments in their lives. Uncertainty gives people autonomy over how they can shape their own lives and provides an opportunity to allow them to grow as individuals when faced with new types of challenges.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Contrary to the popular conception of the start of freshman year as a new beginning, <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/stdntlfe/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/SYE_SummaryReport_FINAL_12.18.12.pdf">one theory suggests</a> that this “beginning” is actually the ending of the lives and identity that freshmen had prior to college. From there on, the theory suggests, students move into a “neutral zone”, gathering information about themselves and enjoying the random exploration of different opportunities in college. It isn’t until the students evaluate their purposes and priorities that they experience a new beginning with a new sense of self. This is why, compared to their first year, most students in their sophomore year are more focused on gaining new insight into their relationships, future and personal identity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">While it is common for people to feel uncertainty during their second year as a result of this period of personal examination, almost everyone goes through some kind of slump at multiple points in their college career. There are some freshmen who have to deal with imposter syndrome and wonder whether they really belong at Brown. Many people in sophomore year have the impending deadline of declaring their concentration. Some juniors network and fly all over the country during recruiting season in order to get a summer internship that can lead to a full-time offer — and some have no interest in that process at all. And all seniors have to decide what their post-grad plans will be. This is not to mention the other personal matters that affect students regardless of their year: outgrowing and developing friendships and relationships, taking care of their mental health, changes in their financial situations and so on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even though slumping in college can be difficult and exhausting while handling a busy schedule, it can give students the opportunity to be more motivated in taking new risks. Ayelet Fishbach, a behavioral science and marketing professor at the University of Chicago, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/how-uncertainty-fuels-anxiety/388066/">found</a> that people feel more excited and work harder on tasks for which the size of the reward is uncertain. The only catch is that the stakes shouldn’t be too high to make people feel anxious about these uncertainties. While it can be overwhelming to make decisions that do have high stakes like a potential salary or grad school, it’s best for students to shift their perspective to consider the unknown rewards they can possibly reap in this time. This time of uncertainty can open doors to new experiences, meeting new people and learning lessons about themselves and the world. As a result, students will have a better understanding of their purpose and values right now and of how they can incorporate this into their lives in order to feel more fulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While uncertainty can give a student more independence to define their own path, that does not mean the person has to suffer during this unpredictable time since that may only hinder their mental health more. For some people, mindfulness and meditation, even through an app, may help them embrace ambiguity and stay present in their life. For others, this anxious time could be an opportunity to truly take advantage of the resources here at Brown and make an impact on campus. In a major study known as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/opinion/college-students.html">Strada-Gallup Alumni survey</a>, 100,000 American college graduates of all ages were questioned about their college experiences to see if there was a connection between what students did on campus and their level of fulfillment today. While they found that attending a highly selective college like Brown does not foretell greater satisfaction, they did find that establishing a great connection with a mentor, taking on a sustained academic project or playing a significant part in a campus organization primarily contributed to their fulfillment. Getting close to a professor or having a mentor in a campus organization can help students have a better sense of their lives and goals. In addition, students can engage in research or write an academic paper within a department that motivates them to discover new information and find topics that spark their interest. Finally, students can engage in leadership positions in campus organizations to contribute to campus and improve the Brown environment for future generations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even though these suggestions can help any student while they are in a slump, it’s important to note that the student must be genuinely interested in these types of activities if they choose to do them. A student doing these activities for the sake of avoidance of uncomfortable feelings or with a closed mind may not get the reflection and clarity they want right now. However, students having open minds, accepting the ambiguity of redefining their social engagement on campus, defining their career goals and developing their purpose can help them navigate the frustrating but crucial time in their lives to develop their own individuality.</span></p>

		<title>Fernandez &#039;21: Vote — even if you’re disillusioned</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The United States’ position as the “defender of democracy” is a narrative that has always dominated the shaping of the American identity. We employ the rhetoric of a country founded by the people, for the people, which serves as a champion model for other countries to admire and imitate. While there are many reasons to be skeptical of this master narrative, there is one in particular that rises to the surface as we move into this electoral season — voting in America.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What does it mean to be the “defender of democracy”? It does not seem to mean having the most active democratic process, for the United States ranks 26th on the list of countries with the highest <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/">voter turnout</a>. It definitely does not seem to mean respecting democracies abroad, as many in Latin America and the Middle East alike can testify to the gross injustices the United States has carried out in the name of democracy. Perhaps then it means, at the very least, a theoretical understanding and faith in the idea of democracy itself, for the country is said to have been built on those very values. However, a general disillusionment with the democratic process in the United States has plagued Americans in recent years, suggesting that our title as the “defender of democracy” has become, and potentially has always been, meaningless rhetoric. </span></p>
<p class="p2">To rise to our democratic values, American citizens must vote in greater numbers. But even in the face of the crucial 2018 elections that have the power to shape the political landscape for years to come,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>many people are not expected to vote. Young people in particular, who often claim to be driving the social revolution that has supposedly been taking place in the 21st century, have the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html">lowest</a> voter turnout rates. The relevant question is whether democracy works if people, even the politically conscious who can vote, choose not to exercise it. I believe the answer is no. How then do we reclaim that vote?</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is a long list of changes that need to take place to re-legitimize the electoral system, namely the removing of big money and corporate interest from the process of choosing leadership. There is a growing suspicion, which I argue is not completely unwarranted, that we go through the motions of democracy to give off the appearance of representation, but the real decisions are made behind closed doors and are constructed to take place in a predetermined way. This sentiment has led to the development of the group of non-voting political activists, which I believe many young people fall into. This is the politically conscious person who refuses to participate in a system they believe to be fraudulent. While I can respect such intentions, the truth is that abstention is not political activism, but the ultimate form of consenting to the way the system currently runs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The more hopeful truth is that, while each vote might not hold the political capital it claims to possess, the vote still counts for something. If everyone were to vote, it would be much more difficult to justify ignoring the entire voting population in favor of special interests.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Voting, regardless of how legitimate you believe our democracy to be, and again I do not argue that it is at all a fair and equitable system, is a great responsibility of serious consequence. The issue grows in importance and interest when considering the educated youth in the country — for example, students at Brown. Choosing to vote in your home state, to vote in Rhode Island or to not vote at all comes with a whole other host of implications, as we come from a position of great privilege. We are quite self-congratulatory in our political education and our strong opinions. But what does it mean if we choose not to invoke that education and those opinions to remove ourselves from the bubble that is the space of the University, momentarily, and find solidarity with people off of College Hill? The role of the privileged, politically conscious person does not end with voting. I have always been and continue to be a strong advocate of action from outside of the established political structure, believing it to be inherently necessary in systems that are so blatantly corrupted and biased.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, I find it difficult to argue against the fact that voting, and not exclusively in the big elections, is an essential first step. It is a first step that can act as an immediately accessible tool for significant change, and at the very worst is potentially inconsequential. It seems clear that there is little to lose and too much at stake to abstain.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>Updated Sept. 20, 12:41 p.m.</strong></em>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her Sept. 16 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/16/letter-steeles-appointment-not-cracked/">letter</a> to The Herald, Julia Rock ’19 rightly noted that it would be reductive to treat the faculty fellowships of Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez ’83 P’18 and former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele as an adequate sampling of the full spectrum of U.S. politics, and she recognized that there exists a vibrant, and increasingly popular, discourse outside the bounds of what our traditional party system embraces. But Rock’s argument, in reducing the complexity of disagreements between the traditional U.S. parties in contemporary politics to essentially nothing, neglects the significance of the many substantive policy differences that separate Perez and Steele. In Rock’s estimation, disagreements over abortion, taxation, gun control and education, among many other issues, all seem to be unsubstantial, or at the very least, fuse together in a cloud of neoliberalism. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What’s more, Rock argues that right-wing politicians, by their nature, are frequently divisive, and so we should be wary of inviting them to serve in any capacity on our campus. While I have <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/14/cardoso-19-free-speech-isnt-license-hate/">argued</a> in the past, and continue to believe, that campuses have a responsibility to ensure they do not give a platform to speakers whose views pose a direct threat to the safety and dignity of its students, it is important to recognize the limitations of this argument. Steele might be wrong about most things, but by identifying him and his views as an example of unacceptable divisiveness, we minimize the gravity of truly dangerous speakers and thinkers and give extremist critics the evidence they need to show that their caricatures of political discourse on college campuses might not be so wrong after all.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To begin, we must recognize that Perez and Steele do, in fact, disagree quite sharply on a number of policies. Rock seems to overlook these by instead focusing on their similarities. But while no one will dispute that the two agree on many issues, that is insufficient to establish that the two don’t disagree over anything substantial. What one believes about free trade is largely independent of what one thinks about abortion. But it’s not surprising that Perez and Steele share many fundamental opinions about, say, the role of capitalism in American society or the merit of free trade, purely by virtue of the fact that they were politically socialized in the same mainstream society that prioritizes these things. But it is not convincing to dismiss the substantive policy differences between Perez and Steele by merely pointing out their similarities. If the only test we need to prove that two individuals do not meaningfully disagree with one another on major policy issues is pointing to substantial areas of agreement, we may conclude that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders would not provide us with an acceptable diversity of opinions either on account of the fact that they both share certain fundamental opinions about capitalism or protectionism. Perez and Steele, then, still provide us with a reasonable — though by no means complete — diversity of opinions that we can engage with critically. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is also danger in writing off most right-wing speakers as equally dangerous. Conflating Michael Steele with speakers like Milo Yiannopoulos (which Rock does implicitly suggest by referring generally to the divisiveness of “right-wing speakers” and “conservative figures”) for instance, is not only intellectually disingenuous, but also neglects the fact that dangerous views exist in various degrees. When we dismiss out of hand all right-wing views equally, we minimize, or at the very least, are less inclined to assess with nuance, the severity of the more extreme views. Rock’s argument, at least as it’s written, leaves no room for nuance in engaging with different views on the right.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While many of those arguing for greater conservative representation on college campuses are not debating in good faith — often, their goal is not actually to increase the diversity of political opinion on campus but to paint colleges as ideologically rigid and hostile toward those that don’t toe the supposed line — we merely fulfill the caricature that many on the right use as the basis for this argument in the first place. Rather than dying on this particular hill, our time is more productively spent resisting more offensive and dangerous speakers than Michael Steele. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Rock is right that we should not content ourselves with Perez and Steele as the bookends of our political discourse, the real, substantive disagreements between them are highly relevant to contemporary political discourse. And while we should be mindful of the need for even greater intellectual diversity among our faculty fellows, we should also celebrate additions like Steele — who for better or worse, represents a significant strain of political thought in American society. </span></p>

		<title>Steinman &#039;19: Requiem for the Bear’s Lair</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I should probably start by admitting that I was never much of a fan. Like the Sharpe Refectory and the Sciences Library, the Bear’s Lair fell into a category of places on campus that I frequented not because I liked being there, but because they were steady and reliable — they got the job done. Though I spent my freshman and junior years living in luxurious proximity to the Nelson Fitness Center, I learned during my sophomore days on Patriot’s Court that convenience always trumps quality when it comes to fitting in a workout, especially during the colder months. Now that I’m living on the southern end of campus again, and now that the Bear’s Lair has been desecrated into a baffling lounge with a pair of forgotten treadmills in a corner, I can already sense the brutalist-shaped hole it has left in my heart and my physical regimen.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">True, the Bear’s Lair always smelled like the Grad Center Bar. (Or was it the GCB that smelled like the Bear’s Lair? Maybe now I’ll finally be able to find out.) The treadmills, if they were working, made terrifying rattling noises, and the array of options was far more limited than can be found at the Nelson. Still, for the students who live south of Waterman St., the Bear’s Lair made it vastly easier to make time in the day for exercise, which has been proven time and again to be one of the best ways to maintain physical and mental health during times of stress. A 2010 <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/vigorous-exercise-linked-with-better-grades/">study</a> even found that vigorous exercise can lead to a “sizable difference” in GPAs for college students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My complaints over a 15-minute walk to a gym where the intention is to work out anyway may seem overblown. But in the interest of promoting student health and wellness, the University should not be undertaking large-scale renovations that make these resources less accessible than they were to begin with. While the deliberations that led to this decision have not been made public, this appears to be a case of the University fixing what isn’t broken (well, except for the treadmills.) In my own experience and that of many of my peers, the Bear’s Lair was popular and well-used, more welcoming than the Nelson and easier to fit into an already packed schedule. Reacting to the University’s upgrades of the Bear’s Lair in early 2011, Christian Talavera ’12 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2011/10/18/bears-lair-replenishes-machines/">pointed out</a> that most students are “on a tight schedule and typically allow and allot a certain time for the gym.” When time for exercising is carved out of the day, even small delays add up.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The satellite fitness center in Emery-Woolley has also ceased to exist, leaving only the Keeney fitness center, which is only accessible to residents of that quad. I wonder how much student input, or even simple observation of these two former fitness centers during peak hours, was incorporated into the choice to eliminate them. I’ve found that communal spaces like the one recently installed in place of the Bear’s Lair are almost always underutilized, failing to reflect the way that students actually interact with each other in their living spaces. Meanwhile, the fact that the Bear’s Lair was popular even in its decrepit state underscores the demand for satellite fitness centers ,no matter their quality. To eliminate the Bear’s Lair and the fitness center in Emery-Woolley without providing any kind of replacement will only concentrate that demand in the remaining two campus gyms, with the Nelson bearing the brunt because of Keeney’s limited access. This will either translate into bigger crowds and longer wait times or a less physically active student body — and the former could easily result in the latter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Later today, our beloved Brown Bears will take to the football field to play (and realistically, lose to) the Harvard Crimson in what is traditionally the most popular sporting event of the year. I’m not saying that the preservation of the Bear’s Lair will transform Brown into an athletic powerhouse, but it certainly couldn’t hurt.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the state of national politics devolves into tribally structured warfare, statewide elections have become easy to map along party lines. A mere 12 states have both a Democratic and a Republican senator; within states that voted for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election, Democrats occupy a scant 11 of 60 senate seats. Democrats running in GOP strongholds could not be blamed for electoral fatalism — in deep Trump country, it seems unfathomable that a candidate from Hillary Clinton’s party could surpass her 2016 results.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In Tennessee, however, former Gov. Phil Bredesen has emerged as a formidable Democratic candidate. Bredesen, 74, is returning to politics after a seven-year hiatus following his gubernatorial tenure from 2003 to 2011. Running for Sen. Bob Corker’s vacant seat, Bredesen has pulled from the playbook used by Alabama Senator Doug Jones to coalesce support across a broad base of the Tennessee electorate. He has set an example for red state Democrats — focusing on proximal issues should supersede political haggling over one’s fit in the national conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Bredesen — who recently polled <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/tennessee/">five points</a> ahead of his Republican opponent, Rep. Marsha Blackburn — is an ideal Democrat for a deep red state like Tennessee. Trump won the state by 26 points, and Republicans have a 28-5 seat advantage in the Tennessee Senate. However, Bredesen has not written off these voters: “there have to be hundreds of thousands of people who voted for me and voted for Donald Trump,” he said in April.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a former governor, Bredesen entered this race with substantial name recognition within his state. He neither needs nor wants endorsements that would connect him to national Democrats. Much like Jones’ campaign in Alabama, Bredesen has avoided rhetoric that would transpose his campaign onto the national stage. “I’m not running against Donald Trump,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/us/politics/tennessee-senate-race-bredesen-blackburn.html">he said in a television commercial</a>, which has proven to be a common refrain during his electoral bid.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Candidates like Bredesen occupy a complicated niche within the increasingly progressive ideology of the Democratic party. He is a centrist Democrat, with a pro-business reputation as governor — further bolstered when he moved into the private sector upon exiting the governorship. He understands the political benefits conveyed to moderate Democrats in the South. “People here support a get-it-done centrist,” he said in a <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/09/phil-bredesen-tennessee-senate-race.html">September interview</a> with New York Magazine. “A generic Democrat would not have much of a chance in a Senate race here.” And while his moderate record and support from Republicans would not appeal to his party’s national coalition, it’s perfect for Tennessee, where no Democrat has won a statewide race since Bredesen’s re-election in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By branding himself as a “get-it-done Democrat,” Bredesen encapsulates the political strategy Democrats ought to employ in red states. Rather than trying to neatly fit into the contemporary Democratic ideological spectrum, Bredesen frames the race within statewide parameters. At town halls and stump speeches, he does not mention Trump. Instead, he focuses on legislation to regulate the pharmaceutical industry in a state that has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic. He discusses his plans to fix the problems caused by Asian Carp, an invasive species that has choked Tennessee’s waterways. And he expends more political energy on the Tennessee Valley Authority than he does on any national issue.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Conversely, Congresswoman Blackburn has eagerly adjoined her campaign to the fate of the GOP at large. A Tea Party stalwart, she forged her conservative bona fides as a taxation hawk in the state senate. Following her election to Congress in 2004, she has fortified her hardline stances on the national stage — a made-to-order Obama critic during his administration and a Trump loyalist since the early days of his campaign. On the campaign trail, she constantly mentions Trump — reflective of her Congressional record, where she votes with the president <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/marsha-blackburn/">91.7 percent</a> of the time.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Her right-wing views comport with her constituency. Blackburn hails from Tennessee’s 7th district; nestled between Kentucky and Alabama, it is the most conservative region of the state. This area is home to the state’s wingnuts, like the state senator who proposed the notorious <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/30/tennessee-dont-say-gay-bill_n_2582390.html">“Don’t Say Gay” bill</a>. Her rhetoric is as divisive as her policy; a regular fixture on cable news, Blackburn echoes the conservative grandstanding typical of Fox News.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In contrast to Bredesen’s focus on statewide issues, Blackburn’s combative conservatism and devout adherence to Trump delimit a divergent campaign strategy. While Bredesen treats the presidential surname as taboo, Blackburn is gluttonous in her invocations of the president. “Tennessee needs a senator who’s gonna support President Donald Trump,” <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/09/phil-bredesen-tennessee-senate-race.html">she said at a September rally</a>. “I am going to be there to stand with President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But her middling poll numbers suggest that at a time of intense dissatisfaction with Congress, national narratives do not dictate statewide elections. Though Tennesseans have wholeheartedly rejected national Democrats, the former Governor has found traction by intentionally distancing himself from the party — he has rightfully framed a statewide election around statewide issues. And as Bredesen gains in the polls, he proves that hypercompetence remains a better political strategy than merely activating partisan identities.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When fall dawns on campus, you’re sure to see two things: first years with lanyards around their necks and upperclassmen in business-casual-but-don’t-worry-I’m-still-chill outfits flocking in hordes to consulting recruiting events. The lanyards fade away with time and wisdom, but on-campus recruitment is here to stay. Consulting companies have spread through Brown like an invasive species, infiltrating our buildings and emails with an incessant drum of events and exhortations. This relentless recruiting is clearly effective, as the students who don’t want to work in consulting (or finance and technology) are becoming a rarer and rarer breed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That doesn’t mean we have to resign ourselves to the limited future that consulting presents. In fact, the ubiquitous presence of consulting companies on campus undermines the spirit of the Open Curriculum. That spirit traces back to 1967, when Ira Magaziner ’69 and Elliot Maxwell ’68 <a href="https://library.brown.edu/libweb/papers/BrownCurriculum.pdf">wrote</a> “Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University,” the report that ignited the curricular revolution that Brunonians still benefit from today. The report details the values that should animate the Open Curriculum, but today, with many students seeing their education as a stepping stone to a lucrative consulting career, those values are under attack. To be responsible stewards of the freedoms that our intellectual predecessors fought for, we should ban consulting companies from recruiting on campus. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown students love to tout their peers’ independence, creativity and dedication to changing the world. These values harken back to a core tenet of the Magaziner-Maxwell report: that “education should be fundamentally an individually oriented process.” It argued that individualism was laudable, and that students would learn better and grow more as people if empowered to make their own choices. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Today, however, it would be nonsensical to suggest that the mobs of students kissing up to recruiters are doing so to foster a deep sense of individuality. Instead of the breadth of careers you’d expect from a purportedly intellectually diverse student body, the paths actually followed are all too similar. Among 2017 Brown graduates, there are as many students working in consulting and finance as there are in the entire nonprofit sector. Forty-two percent of the class of 2017 went into just three industries: consulting, finance and technology. There are <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/class-2015-employment">more consultants</a> than there are people working in environment and sustainability, community service and development, government and public policy and the arts combined.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking at this data, it seems disingenuous to claim Brown students are exercising independent, creative thought in their career choices. Beyond the data, it manifests in the reasons people proffer for wanting to be consultants. Ask your friends (or yourself) why they’re following this path, and many won’t have a thoughtful answer about their values and goals for the world. And I don’t think these people are being evasive, nor do I mean to insult them. Rather, I think the omnipresence of consulting firms on campus inhibits reflection on why a person genuinely would want to be a consultant, or anything else for that matter. The recruiting process transforms the process of finding a vocation into an exercise in following the crowd, normalizing conformity and discouraging critical thinking about the future. Amid the constant inundation of recruiting pitches, what students can see is that consulting is prestigious — a safe next step along the elite path they’ve been on since taking their first SAT prep classes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The mad rush to help rich companies get richer obscures a search for employment animated by an independent quest for meaning and social fulfillment. That’s a grave consequence, one that Brown shouldn’t tolerate if it’s committed more to educating students than to building its future donor base by ensuring its graduates land lucrative careers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This college-to-consulting corridor is another key way recruiting violates the spirit of the Open Curriculum. Magaziner and Maxwell warn of the onset of a “narrow professionalism,” a trend away from a liberal education emphasizing human flourishing and toward a parochial concern with job training. As they wrote, “human relevance is replaced by future practical relevance. For many students this leads to a deadening of the educational process. For many, narrow professionalism removes the possibility that there can be anything valuable in education other than professional training.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If education is reduced to job training, it’s no surprise students flock to the most profitable careers. The admission office loves to tout how the open curriculum means classes are all populated with people passionate about the course material. In reality though, plenty of your classmates are in ECON 0710: “Financial Accounting” because they want to signal to a consulting firm that they know business. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Spending four years at an institution of higher learning only to use it to catapult yourself into the top decile of income earners as a baby-faced 22-year-old is the acme of narrow professionalism. Predetermining your job after a lucrative summer internship is the opposite of exploration — it’s an explicit rejection of the personal and intellectual openness that the open curriculum was designed to foster, that Brown is supposed to protect.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whether by disincentivizing individualism or encouraging narrow professionalism, consulting firms’ presence on campus orients the motivations of students away from the high ideals of the open curriculum. Brown needs to end its complicity in the degradation of the educational atmosphere it claims to foster. To do so will require refusing to host consulting recruiting events on campus and ending the relentless publicization of consulting job opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown shouldn’t dictate to its students what they do after graduating. But Brown is not and does not claim to be a value-neutral institution. The University understands itself as having a public and institutional responsibility, and we should demand it live up to this ideal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown’s values are most clear in its <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/mission">mission statement</a>, which is worth reading: “The mission of Brown University is to serve the community, the nation and the world by discovering, communicating, and preserving knowledge and understanding in a spirit of free inquiry, and by educating and preparing students to discharge the offices of life with usefulness and reputation.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As accomplished close readers, you’ll notice the statement does not say: “The mission of Brown University is to serve the interests of wealthy companies by encouraging its students to sell out in a spirit of greed and cynicism, and by preparing students to discharge the offices of life with fancy sounding jobs that perpetuate inequality and conformity.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I, for one, am happy with the mission the way it is. It’s time Brown reaffirms its founding values by proclaiming that making PowerPoints for Fortune 500 companies is neither a “useful” nor a “reputable” way to lead a life. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The career fair is today. As Brown students weave through a sea of recruiters, they’re likely to see table after table of technology, finance and consulting companies. These large, moneyed corporations have something very attractive to offer students — certainty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> In a 2017 Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ba0c9234-a2d7-11e7-9e4f-7f5e6a7c98a2">piece</a>, senior employees at a handful of management consulting firms described their ideal employees as “insecure overachievers” — workers that are eager to please others by drowning themselves in, and excelling at, their work. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Human resources directors admit that they seek out insecure overachievers and try to “(get) them hooked on the high-status identity of the firm.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> I submit the following to you: If you go to Brown, you are probably an overachiever. In fact, you probably derive a lot of satisfaction from being an overachiever. Otherwise, you probably wouldn’t have spent time in high school studying to ace standardized tests and earning top marks in your classes, all while balancing a smorgasbord of extracurriculars. You’re really good at jumping through hoops. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And, if you’re a graduating senior, you’re probably feeling insecure. I know I am. I worry about leaving the security of an educational institution and jumping headfirst into the job market. Will I find the right job? What if I graduate without finding anything while all my friends get ready to move away and start at a new company? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These companies know that we’re scared and smart, and so they recruit early, scooping up young talent that’s hungry for a start date before they even receive a diploma. I understand that some students choose these roles because they have family to support or massive debt to pay. But for the vast majority of students participating in the recruiting process, this is not the case. Recruiting is appealing because it’s a ticket out of uncertainty and into a high salary and a relocation bonus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The truth is that most organizations are not large or bureaucratic enough to predict their staffing needs almost a year in advance. Positions in arts, education, public service and many other fields don’t start posting their fall openings until graduation season. It’s scary to wait until the spring to start interviewing for positions, but this timeline is completely normal. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The world needs smart and dedicated people working on big problems. I think we can be some of those people. We can do things with our skills that are more socially valuable than coding widgets and making spreadsheets to tell a tire company how to make one percent more each year. We can do more with our degrees than make a ton of money for someone else. (The average employee of a “Big 3” management consulting firm brings in $400,000 to $500,000 in revenue for the company per year.) </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This problem, however, is larger than individual choice. CareerLAB should shift the recruiting landscape for graduating seniors. First, they ought to emphasize that most students do not solidify their post-graduate plans until the spring of their senior year. Second, they could adjust the fee schedule for employers recruiting on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">CareerLAB currently<a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/sites/brown.edu.campus-life.support.careerlab/files/uploads/2018-2019%20Recruiting%20Fees.pdf"> offers a reduced fee</a> to nonprofit companies recruiting at Brown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To incentivize greater entry into the nonprofit sector, CareerLAB ought to lower this fee to zero. Conversely, CareerLAB ought to assess an additional surcharge for technology giants, large financial institutions and high-powered consulting firms. These additional fees can be used to expand the Careers in the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/ccg program">Common Good program</a>, an initiative that aims to help students pursue nonprofit and public interest careers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These giant companies aren’t hurting for cash, and they certainly won’t be dissuaded from recruiting at Brown due to a fee hike. Companies like Bain and McKinsey purposefully hire employees from prestigious universities to shore up their own legitimacy. They sell expertise to their clients — what better way to do that than to start growing talent from a crop of newly minted graduates from ultra-selective schools?</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s up to us to help create the world we want to see. If we want a society where every child can access quality education, where people of color are not subjected to an unfair criminal justice system and where our environment is protected, it’s up to us to choose to work for it, and it’s on Brown to help make that happen.</span>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Ruth Foster ’19 applied to an internship at a hedge fund in a fit of desperation but was deemed “not a good fit” after arguing in her application that Brown should pay higher taxes — in hindsight, this ideological mismatch should have been obvious. She can be reached at ruth_foster@brown.edu. Please send<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>responses to this opinion to </span><span class="s1">letters@browndailyherald.com and op-eds to opinions@browndailyherald.com.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">“The death of one man is a tragedy; the death of millions is a statistic,” Joseph Stalin was reputed to have said. This (likely misattributed) quotation still bears a certain eeriness by its connection to the 20th century dictator, whose regime bore responsibility for millions of deaths by ethnic cleansings, executions and famines — and ultimately, the statement is eerie because it is true. We evaluate issues on the basis of their emotional salience, which more often than not biases our perception of them. This is a well-documented phenomenon in psychology: the <a href="http://heuristics.behaviouralfinance.net/availability/">availability heuristic</a> is the mental shortcut whereby people overestimate the importance of examples that are vivid and readily available to them. Everyone knows the kinds of stories that are guaranteed to make headlines: The deadly terrorist attack and the most recent mass shooting. These stories engender more empathy and more anger than other, more pervasive issues. The media endlessly relates their vivid narratives, their horrific details and their clear-cut bad guys. But this leaves public outrage with a blind spot for the victims of the more commonplace and widespread tragedies. To evaluate issues clearly, we must look beyond the stories and instead at the numbers. We ought to give due weight — alongside our empathic responses­ — to the statistical significance of the stories that make headlines, for the sake of the systemic issues that rarely do so.</p>
<p class="p2">Compare the perceived threat of terrorism with deadlier risks looming incessantly over all of us. Defense against terrorism, according to <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/11/defending-against-terrorism-has-remained-a-top-policy-priority-for-americans-since-9-11/">Pew Research</a>, has remained for most Americans a “top policy priority” every year since 2001 — 73 percent of U.S. adults thought so in 2018, with more agreement on this than on any other policy priority. But the threat of terrorism is comparatively insignificant for Americans. On Sept. 11, 2001, the terrorist attacks killed approximately 3,000 people. During the next 15 years — from then until Dec 31, 2016, according to the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/683984.pdf">U.S. Government Accountability Office</a> — 85 attacks in the U.S. met the criteria for acts of domestic terrorism, and these killed a total of 225 people. In 2016, by contrast, heart disease, the leading cause of death, killed 635,260 people. In that <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812451">year</a> alone, car crashes killed 37,461 people, with an average of 102 deaths per day. To be clear, these are not fair comparisons to make. The issues could not be more disparate and could not require more disparate types of policy interventions — apples to oranges. But terrorists capture the American imagination because they make for catchy headlines and for compelling outgroups. It is beyond the scope of this article to urge a reassessment of the billions spent on fighting and protecting against terrorism. But if one wants to understand the biggest threats to the welfare of the majority of Americans, one ought to resist the flashiness of current headlines and stories in the media and instead ought to put the issues in perspective.</p>
<p class="p2">Also consider the comparison of America’s problem of mass shootings in particular with that of guns in general. Paul Bloom, Yale psychologist and author of the controversial book “Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>made the point in 2013 that mass shootings in the previous 30 years had accounted for only about one-tenth of one percent of homicides in the United States. More recently, the Gun Violence Archive, a joint initiative of the New York Times and Reddit, estimated that 358 mass shootings took place in 2015. While this number is shocking, it is also important to keep in mind that homicides in 2016 accounted for 11,004 deaths. For a decade, guns in these homicides have annually killed between 10,000 and 15,000 people. Moreover, <a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/safety-topics/guns/">in 2016 alone</a>, guns used in suicides killed 22,938 people, after a gradual rise annually over the last decade. Of course, the United States has a huge epidemic of mass shootings, especially in comparison with any other developed nation. It is also important to acknowledge that mass shootings disproportionately affect black Americans, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/mass-shootings-tracker-analysis-us-gun-control-reddit">Guardian</a> reported — a reality that is obscured by looking at death tolls in just numbers. But the media’s disproportionate emphasis on mass shootings when you consider the number of fatalities that result from suicides and homicides skews our understanding of America’s gun problem. It is in the media’s nature to cover the sensational, and I am taking no stance here on the policy interventions that should be drawn from these statistics. I am saying only that to understand the nature and the extent of the problem of guns, we have to look at the numbers.</p>
<p class="p2">It might be argued that emotionally salient events such as terrorist attacks and mass shootings carry with them a psychological burden that cannot be quantified — that people want to feel safe as much as they want actually to be safe, and that those two are not the same. As a result, these threats can loom large and preoccupy our minds. It goes without mention how naive it is to wish that statistics could move people in the way that an emotive story does. But the widespread and growing popularity of movements such as effective altruism — which encourages rational giving so as to help the greatest possible number of people — does give me hope that rational evaluation can indeed influence people on a large scale. By all means, we should follow our hearts or listen to that feeling in our gut; but, as we do, we have to keep the numbers in mind for the sake of perspective.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What do the firing of a former Secretary of State, the hiring of an FBI director, the possibility of an onset of nuclear war with North Korea and the conspiracy against a Russian leaker have in common? They are all announcements that some U.S. citizens cannot access via President Trump’s Twitter feed. For reasons including dislike and distrust, Trump has blocked many U.S. citizens from accessing, replying to and reposting the tweets and retweets on the President’s profile. These actions are not only unacceptable and inappropriate from the man leading our nation, but they are questionably legal. Unfortunately, the framers of our constitution did not foresee the technological revolution that would take place 200 years hence and could not lay the ground rules for discourse on public and Presidential social media profiles. However, they gave important protections to U.S. citizens regarding the freedom of speech and participation in public forums. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This issue may seem cavil; however, it has consequences much wider-ranging than the touch of a finger, crossing into the realm of a constitutional foray. If, for instance, the President blocked every dissident who voiced disapproval, leaving him in a digital echo-chamber of Fox News and “patriots,” would his self-imposed ignorance impinge on the First Amendment rights of citizens to “petition to the government a redress of grievances?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For the President to put his fingers in his ears to block the many contrary voices in contemporary society would at very least fall outside a bevy of institutional norms cemented over 200 years in a democracy prioritizing healthy discourse and debate. But what does the Constitution say if Trump seeks to block expression by only a few dissenters? The Supreme Court has <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/designatedforum.htm">upheld</a> in numerous cases that citizens have a right to participate in and take full advantage of public forums, which does not necessarily have to be a physical space. Trump, through the nature of his tweets, has established his feed as a public forum. The Department of Justice, looking to explain or qualify the President’s rash online statements, <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-02-19/donald-trumps-tweets-are-now-presidential-records">describes</a> the President’s tweets as “official statements of the President of the United States.” Are Trump’s blocking tactics violating the rights of these barred individuals from participating in a designated public forum?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Some see clear constitutional violations and have challenged Trump’s right as “Tweeter in Chief” to block users. The Knight First Amendment Institute sued the President for a violation of the First Amendment on behalf of seven plaintiffs whom Trump had blocked. In May of 2018, a federal judge <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/389021-judge-rules-trump-cant-block-users-on-twitter">ruled</a> in favor of the plaintiffs. After over a week of hesitation, Trump unblocked these specific users. However, he continues to <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/05/media/trump-twitter-block/index.html">block</a> many other users, from ordinary citizens to a Veterans organization with thousands of followers itself. Seeking the last word, Trump’s Department of Justice has <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/04/justice-department-appeals-court-ruling-on-trump-twitter-blocking-case-624160">appealed</a> the case citing “uncharted waters” and dangerous implications for the First Amendment. Obviously, Trump has not respected the judge’s ruling that he cannot both keep his Twitter as a public forum for official statements and block those whom he finds abrasive to his ego.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yes, it is possible for someone to circumvent one of Trump’s digital hurdles by logging out of their account and ghost-auditing Trump-World’s latest tweetstorm. But to Trump, their silence would remain golden. This is the opposite of what our constitution envisioned. Even in this other dimension which Trump has created, citizens have legal rights to access public forums and to engage with their public officials. Trump’s ego-challenged defenses are more than just “Sad!” — they have profound policy implications leading further down the slippery slope of silencing democratic discourse.</span></p>

		<title>Aman &#039;20: Give rising juniors off-campus permission</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/25/aman-20-give-rising-juniors-off-campus-permission/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Complaints about off-campus permissions for rising juniors aren’t new. For example, in 2017, The Herald reported that many students thought the process was a hassle and faced pressure from landlords to sign leases before receiving permission to live off campus. Ultimately, this frustrating process leaves some students locked “into a lease” and “also responsible for living on campus,” according to Kate Tompkins, former associate director of programs for the Office of Residential Life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact that we need to request permission to not pay for on-campus housing — and pay a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/bursar/tuition-and-fees-0/undergraduate-fees">$400 fee</a> if we do live off-campus — has always seemed slightly ridiculous. This situation reached new levels of absurdity this summer, when I realized I had friends both in the summer assignment lottery for on-campus housing — meaning they would be assigned housing and possibly placed with people outside their group because of a lack of available rooms — and in the off-campus permission appeals process. This uncertainty led to extremely stressful summer experiences for several of my close friends, as they waited to find out where they would be living this year. Granting off-campus permission to all juniors who apply would reduce the length of the summer assignment list and allow more students to secure their housing situation earlier in the year without worrying about being forced to pay for both on- and off-campus housing. In short, granting off-campus permission to all juniors would greatly reduce the stress experienced by rising juniors planning to live both on- and off-campus. (Currently, the ResLife website suggests that priority is given to rising seniors who apply for off-campus permission).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s unclear why Brown’s housing policy leaves some students waiting for on-campus housing and others waiting for off-campus permission: Somehow we seem to simultaneously have a surplus and shortage of on-campus housing. Is the University keeping rooms empty for transfer students? Is there a large number of mismatches between housing groups and available room configurations? I don’t know the number of students in summer assignment, but based on the number of students I personally know who waited in the lottery, it seems to be a sizable figure, too large to be explained by these factors. Any reasons that explain the current system certainly aren’t effectively communicated to students. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Some might argue that granting permission to all juniors could result in more empty rooms and lost revenue for the University. Yet no other Ivy League schools require students to live on campus after their first two years. If peer institutions can make their budgets balance without requiring some juniors to live on-campus, so can we. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Furthermore, the University shouldn’t force students to pay for housing they don’t want. Instead of forcing students to live on campus, the University should improve dorm quality and reduce the cost of room and board so students actually want to live there. The University <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/11/facilities-management-renovate-five-dorms-next-two-summers/">renovated</a> Minden Hall and the Vartan Gregorian Quad, created a lounge in Graduate Center E this past summer and plans to improve Hegeman Hall and Machado House next summer. These renovations are a good start, but more work is still needed to make living on campus an attractive option for upperclassmen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the University thoughtfully designs academic policies to limit unnecessary stress in students’ lives, this logic seemingly does not apply to University housing policy, as the current system clearly creates a great deal of stress and uncertainty. If the University truly cares about student well-being, they should consider allowing all juniors who apply to live off-campus.</span></p>

		<title>Clark &#039;19: A reminder of reality to those who judge</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Earlier this week, Aidan Calvelli ’19 wrote a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/24/calvelli-19-bcg-ban-consulting-groups/">column</a> calling to ban consulting firms from campus, arguing that “the mad rush to help rich companies get richer obscures a search for employment animated by an independent quest for meaning and social fulfillment.” But Calvelli’s argument relies on two seriously flawed assumptions. First, students who consider salary as a part of the decision to take a job in consulting do so because of the love of money, rather than the need for it — he implies that students in consulting “sell out in a spirit of greed and cynicism.” Second, self-actualization is a greater end than earning a large salary, and therefore should be prioritized in career decisions. Calvelli concludes that the University should protect us from opportunities that appeal to the desire for money. I want to show that these assumptions are misguided, and that banning consulting groups from campus would only be deleterious to students’ freedom to choose what is best for us. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Calvelli insinuates that students who take consulting jobs are sellouts because consulting is a lucrative career. The implication here is that students choose this job over other pursuits because we want money more than we want to make a positive impact on the world around us. Perhaps, at the age of 21, Calvelli is able to prioritize a job’s fit for his “individuality” over its ability to pay his bills. However, this is not the case for all of us. I took a job in consulting because I have to support myself when I graduate, and so my salary matters to me. Other students I know want consulting jobs because the remuneration would allow them to pay off student loans and support extended family. Calvelli’s suggestion that all students who choose a consulting job because of its salary are motivated by greed comes from the incredibly privileged assumption that students do not need to make practical and financial considerations when choosing a job.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Not only is it privileged to assume that all students can share his same priorities, but it is also intolerant to believe that all students should have these priorities. Choosing a job based on its conduciveness to your self-growth is certainly admirable, but wanting to earn a salary than can support your family, pay off your loans or pay for your continued education is equally praiseworthy. Practical reasons aside, consulting appeals to many students because it can springboard us into positions of influence once we leave our firms, including positions in careers that speak to our passions and goals to help our communities. In fact, many graduates spend only three years at a consulting firm before leaving to pursue graduate school or another career. Thus Calvelli’s cited data, which breaks down graduates’ employment plans only for the year immediately after graduating, is misleading when trying to understand what Brown students end up contributing to the world in the long run. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Brown students are individuals. We have different aspirations and needs, and we are capable of making our own decisions about how to optimize what we value. Arguing that consulting groups should be completely banned from campus implies that individual students aren’t capable of upholding other values when faced with an opportunity to make money, and so the University should protect us from temptations that will lead us to make bad decisions. But we do not need the University to make decisions for us. Students who enter consulting make this choice because it aligns with our goals, and not because interactions with recruiters cause us to lose our powers of independent decision-making. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Of course, the University should make every effort to ensure that all students have the opportunities we need to start careers that fulfill our interests and passions. This requires ensuring that a diversity of organizations recruit on campus, and that students are aware of these opportunities. However, this does not require banning groups that are of interest to a large population of students. The job of the University is neither to prescribe moral hierarchies nor to impose its values on its students, and so Calvelli’s proposal that it paternalistically preempt students from applying to careers of our choice is unwise.</span></p>

		<title>Friedman &#039;19: JUMP bikes are a boon for public transport — for some</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/28/friedman-19-jump-bikes-boon-public-transport/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Monday night, I test drove a JUMP bike on a journey from Wayland Square’s Starbucks to the Rockefeller Library. The bike shattered my expectations, especially after the electric pedal-assist kicked in and made the hill up Angell Street seem like an airport runway. I would classify the experience akin to riding an electric chariot, and the bike feels like a moped at top speeds (around 20 mph). Long gone are the days of walking into class sweaty after a strenuous morning ride. It seems that JUMP bikes are here to stay, which I think is great. Where other cities have failed, Providence has succeeded in its implementation of bike-sharing, but despite JUMP’s success, the lack of equity in distribution of bikes deserves redress.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">JUMP bikes arrived in Providence this September during a turbulent time for the bike-share and electric scooter rental industry. Docked bike-sharing is an established concept in big cities like London and New York, which rolled out their Santander Cycles and Citi Bike programs in 2010 and 2013, respectively. Now, “dockless” bike-sharing, which allows parking of bikes anywhere outside the public right-of-way, has achieved unprecedented scale in an increasing number of cities. As of 2017, “five major dockless bike-share companies reported operating in approximately 25 American cities,” according to the <a href="https://nacto.org/bike-share-statistics-2017/">National Association of City Transportation Officials</a>. As of August 2018, Bird, an electric scooter company with a similar business model, reported operations in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17796068/bird-scooter-govtech-platform-geofence-cities">over 60 U.S. cities</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Providence got its first taste of the transportation “sharing” economy this past summer, when Bird scooters <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180815/bird-scooters-gone-from-providence-for-now">appeared</a> without warning in July. However, Bird’s sudden invasion of Providence’s streets was over as soon as it started, as its scooters vanished just a month later after extensive reactionary regulation, possibly to the disappointment of next year’s Brown pre-college students. Emerging electric scooter entrepreneurs take note: Scooter numbers are now capped at 300, companies must pay the city $1 per day per scooter and the density of scooters may not exceed 100 per square mile.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite creating barriers for unannounced scooter arrivals, Providence officials still believed in the public utility of shared e-vehicles. Providence smartly learned from the mistakes of bigger cities, whose urban landscapes became economic battlegrounds between warring bike companies. Many companies left behind bike graveyards when they retreated from reactive and prohibitively expensive regulation in cities like Dallas, whose bike population decreased by about 16,500 this year. Providence avoided this by awarding JUMP an exclusive five-year contract in 2017. The city partnered with Lifespan and Tufts Health Plan to sponsor a <a href="http://www.providenceri.gov/planning/jump-bike-share/">reduced rate plan</a> for low-income riders, allowing them one hour of ride time per day for a year for $5. The JUMP project in Providence received public assistance as well; it was funded by Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant money that was reallocated from the failed streetcar initiative. The project also <a href="https://www.ecori.org/transportation/2018/9/24/city-says-providence-bike-share-is-for-all-residents">receives</a> $200,000 annually from D.C. nonprofit PeopleForBikes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">So far, the bikes have been a huge success, especially for Mayor Jorge Elorza, who tactfully released a <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180905/electric-bike-sharing-system-starts-hitting-street-in-downtown-providence">statement</a> addressing not only affordability, but also the environment and public health: “The JUMP bike-share program offers Providence residents and visitors an affordable, eco-friendly and healthy way to explore or commute.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">However, for all of JUMP’s success, I think Elorza and the city need to address systematic flaws. Specifically, the distribution of bike docking stations is unfairly skewed toward the College Hill neighborhood. Low-income neighborhoods such as Washington Park and Olneyville, whose residents are most likely to use JUMP bikes to get to work, have few docking stations. I understand that College Hill rides present the best opportunity for JUMP (which is now owned by Uber) to make money, but considering that the program receives significant funding from nonprofits and the government, it is incumbent on either the company or the city to address the geographic disparity in service.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">By granting JUMP exclusive rights to the city, Providence successfully avoided the infighting that doomed the bike-sharing programs of many other American cities. However, a challenge remains: Providence needs to leverage the deal with JUMP to better serve the constituents whom the program stands to help the most.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">He is nine years old, 10 at most. His feet dangle above the ground. His tiny arms rest uncomfortably on the dinner table. He is holding in his miniature hands the newest iPhone, swiping and scrolling as though it were second nature. Conversation swells around him, but he is unaware. Then, minutes later, he carefully places the iPhone on the table and turns to his mother.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’m bored,” he declares. “Give me the Nintendo.”</p>
<p class="p2">Do you recognize this boy? He’s everywhere. He’s a product of the technological age — an age in which children are given iPads when their parents are busy instead of being told to go play outside. Indeed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/the-average-age-for-a-child-getting-their-first-smartphone-is-now-10-3-years/">studies show</a> that on average, an American child receives their first phone at age 10. He is an undeniable fixture of our consumer society. He is fed advertisements with his cereal. He cannot imagine fashioning a fantastical world using only a box and a stick, because he has always had limitless entertainment at his fingertips, prepackaged for his convenience.</p>
<p class="p2">What does this boy convey about our society, about our ability to enjoy the simple pleasures in life, instead of buying our entertainment and exchanging the old model for the new almost immediately? As technology continues to encroach upon our daily lives, should we be adapting or fighting against it?</p>
<p class="p2">Silicon Valley is perhaps the most recognizable technological space in the world. Yet <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-parents-raising-their-kids-tech-free-red-flag-2018-2">according to Business Insider</a>, Silicon Valley parents are raising their children in a relatively tech-free way, because they’re fully exposed to the potentially harmful effects of socializing their children in an environment dominated by technology. Indeed, a <a href="https://www.siliconvalleycf.org/sites/default/files/publications/cel-tech-report-2017.pdf">recent survey</a> of the Silicon Valley community uncovered common concerns that excessive technological use is shortening attention spans and creating a culture of dependency. The potential benefits of technology are innumerable, as the Silicon Valley community can certainly attest to. But that doesn’t mean that there are no associated risks. It is important to understand that technology changes the way we think, behave and interact with others. Excessive exposure from a young age has detrimental effects on our mental health, our ability to make close friendships and our capacity to maintain focus.</p>
<p class="p2">As college students, it’s probably too early to start thinking about parenting techniques for our future Apple-obsessed offspring, but it isn’t too early to think about the ways in which the technological age has impacted our own ability to enjoy the simple pleasures in life.</p>
<p class="p2">That child that I described at the dinner table will grow up to be a young adult who is similar to me. As a senior, I was born on the cusp of the 21st century. That means that I actually got to go play outside and that my first cell phone had an antenna. But by the time I was a preteen, social media and gadgets were very much a part of my daily life, and as a young adult technology monopolizes most of my time. <a href="https://qz.com/1202888/are-kids-actually-addicted-to-technology/">According to Robert Lustig</a>, professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California, technology has effects on our brains similar to those caused by drugs, ultimately leading to addiction. When exposed to technology at an age before the prefrontal cortex is fully developed, we are more susceptible to these addictive effects and more likely to feel withdrawal symptoms when we are without our phones.</p>
<p class="p2">Think about it. When is the last time you went a full day without tech? When’s the last time you played a board game instead of a video game, or read a paperback instead of a PDF file? We may like to think that we are independent from our technology, and we may scoff at the young boy unable to put down his phone. We’re not like that, we think to ourselves. We were born before the 2000s. But the truth is we may be just as addicted to our tech and just as restless.</p>
<p class="p2">Don’t get me wrong. I’m not arguing that we renounce technology altogether and return to ancient times. Instead, I am proposing a return to the simple pleasures in life, if only occasionally. I am proposing a tech-free Sunday, one spent with friends and family, with a good book or a board game. I am asking for a little bit of imagination — for us to find the fantastical in everyday objects and realities instead of finding our entertainment in tech.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In a post-9/11 world, in pursuit of its mission to thwart terrorism in the United States and ensure national security, U.S. intelligence agencies have become larger, more complex and, if possible, even more secretive. There has been no concomitant change in oversight, however, allowing almost imperial power to a community whose operations bear and potentially infringe upon some of our most precious constitutional freedoms. The absence of new checks on these agencies makes daunting the task of determining whether they are crossing crucial lines or taking actions of which the public, were it aware, would disapprove.</p>
<p class="p2">In 2010, Washington Post journalists published an investigative series called “Top Secret America” in an attempt to examine this huge and powerful network and concluded that it was inefficient and opaque to both those entrusted with oversight of funding and the people it is meant to protect. While national security and government secrecy should be preeminent, the impact of the “war on terror” may be so intrusive upon our individual liberties as to make its operations unconscionable in a free and democratic society. Finding the correct balance, where to draw the line, is one of the most pressing issues we face.</p>
<p class="p2">The evanescence of the enemy at large makes it much more difficult to assess the effectiveness of a project of this scope. Seventeen years after the horrific attacks of 9/11, the most pressing threats are more often portrayed as coming from small cells or lone wolves than from an army of terrorists, hardly comparing to the two-headed menace of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Yet taxpayers’ money is now being consumed at a rate it never had been before: The U.S. Intelligence Budget is up to <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america">$57.7 billion</a>, over twice the size it was Sept. 10, 2001. With more and more taxpayer money on the line, it is imperative that this system be tailored to a real threat and then managed transparently and effectually.</p>
<p class="p2">Not only have concerns over secrecy caused many intelligence organizations to become ever more clandestine, the lack of shared data has increased redundancy, reduced effectiveness and, in many instances, potentially impacted civil liberties. As just one example, <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/">51 federal organizations and military commands</a> are tasked with tracking the paper trail to and from terrorist networks, and often do not divide the work, but rather produce similar and often overlapping products.</p>
<p class="p2">Furthermore, our government has increased its commitment to remaining as secretive as possible. A large study found that “for every dollar the government spent declassifying documents in 2009, it spent <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/2010/09/government_keeps_national_secu.html.">$196 million</a> maintaining the secrets already on the books.” Also in 2009, “the U.S. government imposed secrecy orders on 103 new patents,” “the number of closed-door meetings rose to 7,221” and “classified programs accounted for <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/2010/09/government_keeps_national_secu.html.">$35 billion</a>, or 16 percent of the Pentagon’s acquisition funding.”</p>
<p class="p2">Many government officials see institutional secrecy as necessary, and media projects like “Top Secret America” are considered a destabilizing force. Former Acting Director of National Intelligence <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/2010/07/washington_reacts_to_top_secre.html.">David C. Gompert said</a>, “We accept that we operate in an environment that limits the amount of information we can share. However, the fact is, the men and women of the Intelligence Community have improved our operations, thwarted attacks and are achieving untold successes every day.” The reason why the government keeps so much of its intelligence clandestine is because it has to. To counterbalance current risks caused in part by international interventions that some believe to be necessary, we have increased the size, scope and complexity of our surveillance system. But the real question remains: What is the cost to our freedom, reputation, efficiency and budget?</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To fix the system, there must be more transparency in our government. Congress, which allocates billions of dollars a year to these networks, could begin sharing information that does not risk national security. In response to Top Secret America, Congress began to act. As <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/2010/07/washington_reacts_to_top_secre.html">former Sen. Kit Bond said</a>: “We can do more to keep our nation safe, and improving Congressional oversight and ensuring the top spy chief has the authority needed to streamline our intelligence community are the first steps.” However, with a deadlocked and inefficient Congress, often too timid to confront internal security issues, it is unlikely we will see the desired change anytime soon. Thus, it falls to the media to continue to push the boundaries and demand positive change.</span></p>

		<title>Fernandez &#039;21: Critiquing attitudes toward abortion in the U.S. and beyond</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Women’s reproductive rights are once more at the center of the political discourse in the United States. As the Senate moves to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a decision that will affect nationwide legislation for decades to come, people around the country are yet again compelled to come out to defend a woman’s basic right to agency over her body. Setting aside the allegations of sexual assault that are by themselves enough to condemn the confirmation as completely unacceptable, Kavanaugh’s political opinions will threaten many of the victories made in the last decades to ensure the rights of traditionally marginalized groups. The right to a safe and accessible abortion is at the forefront of the discussion.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In light of these recent events, it has become evident that the United States is in serious danger of falling behind the rest of the world in the movement to protect a woman’s right to choose. I would like to focus this discussion on the comparison between the development of legislation in the United States and in Latin America, for I believe U.S. literature on women’s issues in Latin American societies highlights some of the fundamental conflicts the United States is facing. Latin America is a region that continues to have some of the most restrictive and oppressive reproductive laws in the world. Only two countries in the region, Uruguay and Cuba, have legalized abortion independent of justification. In some countries like El Salvador, abortion continues to be highly criminalized. However, Latin America has recently experienced a push toward liberalizing abortion laws. There have been large social movements, like those in Argentina, and even actual legislative change, such as in Chile, where abortion became legal in certain circumstances in 2017. While it is undeniable that the United States continues to have more liberal abortion laws than most countries in Latin America, the latter is quite clearly moving forward, while the first is experiencing a standstill, if not a <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-worldwide-2017">step backwards</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Writers in the United States have written a lot about reproductive rights in Latin America. However, U.S. writers have addressed the issue in the same way they have traditionally written about the region — with problematic oversimplifications and a presumption of moral authority.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the New York Times opinion piece “From Uruguay, a Model for Making Abortion Safer,” the author speaks to the process by which Uruguay first made abortions safe for all woman and later won the struggle to legalize the procedure in all cases. The author begins by noting that Uruguay is “one of the most democratic countries in Latin America,” a clarification any American writer has to make before praising any country in the Global South. For example, this qualification would not have been made in an article about abortion rights in a Western European country, despite the fact that Uruguay ranks better than France in the very study on corruption perceptions that the author sites. Furthermore, this Uruguayan model is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/opinion/from-uruguay-a-model-for-making-abortion-safer.html">presented as an example</a> only for other Latin American and African countries, suggesting the United States has resolved the issue and can learn nothing from the model. A more drastic example is found in examining the literature on Cuba, where American publications very rarely seem to frame the discourse around the fact that Cuba has historically had one of the most progressive reproductive legislations in the world. Instead, writers have focused on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/world/americas/in-cuba-an-abundance-of-love-but-a-lack-of-babies.html">high abortion rates in Cuba</a>, noting that many Cuban women decide to abort their pregnancies because of economic instability or lack of support. No mention, of course, is made that these same situations exist in the United States as well, and that perhaps part of the reason abortion rates are lower here than they are in Cuba is that Americans, especially in more conservative states, do not have the same access to affordable abortions that Cuban women do. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I would like to reiterate that I am not arguing that reproductive rights are, in general, better in Latin America than they are in the United States. The region continues to be highly restrictive, and even the most liberal countries face some of the same issues the United States faces as well as others more specific to their nation’s circumstance. However, I argue that these examples call into question the moral and critical standing that writers from the United States have on the issue. It strikes me as yet another instance in which the neocolonial perspective distorts the ways we perceive the complicated realities that exist in Latin America by translating these realities into our culturally specific framework and thereby oversimplifying them. Furthermore, this distortion serves to give us a false sense of security that we have resolved certain issues. The reality is that, while I am hopeful about the future of reproductive rights in Latin America, I am highly threatened by the recent decisions made in the United States and am wary of what is to come in the future. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the United States seeks to hold any of the moral and critical standing it claims<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— which, while highly problematic, is nonetheless widely accepted by most Americans — it needs to actively address its own recurring issues surrounding reproductive rights. The threat to these rights is one that we are experiencing in our very communities right now. This is not the case of some far away injustice affecting people we do not see every day. Critiquing Latin America and other regions while ignoring the deteriorating situation within our own borders is one the most dangerous things we could do. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">By any metric, the past few years have not been good to liberal democracy. As Larry Diamond, a Stanford University professor of sociology who specializes in democracy, <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/facing-democratic-recession">famously noted</a>, we may be in the midst of a global “democracy recession.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Populists with autocratic tendencies have enjoyed electoral success in the past few years, and it appears that this trend is only intensifying — since just last year, over half of the countries assessed in <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/01/31/democracy-continues-its-disturbing-retreat">an Economist report</a> saw their Democracy Index rating fall.</p>
<p class="p2">Perhaps no country, though, is as close to the void as Brazil. On Oct. 7, Brazilians are posed to decide among a diverse pool of candidates for president, but polling suggests it will be a competition between Fernando Haddad, an academic and former center-left mayor of São Paulo hand-picked by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Jair Bolsonaro, a hitherto marginalized extreme right-wing congressman, famously sympathetic toward Brazil’s former military dictatorship. While Bolsonaro will almost certainly win the first round, it’s unlikely he will garner a majority at that point. But disturbingly, in a run-off, Bolsonaro and Haddad are locked in a <a href="https://observador.pt/2018/09/30/eleicoes-no-brasil-sondagem-indica-empate-tecnico-entre-bolsonaro-e-haddad/">statistical dead heat</a>.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated. Brazil — the world’s eighth largest economy and home to half the population of South America — is in immediate danger of doing irreparable damage to its democratic institutions. No other democracy of Brazil’s size and influence has faced as dire a threat to its institutions in recent years. Though it is easy to read claims of dictatorships and oppression as platitudinal or hysterical — especially considering how commonplace rhetoric of autocracy and illiberalism has become in the United States — we must resist that temptation. After contextualizing the situation historically and within Brazil’s contemporary political framework, we will be able to see what makes Brazil’s choice this Sunday so dire.</span></p>
<p class="p2">First, it is important to assess the nature of the threat. Bolsonaro has been serving as a federal deputy in the lower chamber of Brazil’s legislature since 1991. For most of that period, he was a fringe politician, notable mostly for his <a href="http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/bolsonaro-quotprefiro-filho-morto-em-acidente-a-um-homossexualquot,cf89cc00a90ea310VgnCLD200000bbcceb0aRCRD.html">extreme homophobia</a> (he once claimed he would be incapable of loving a gay son, and would prefer for him to die in an accident), <a href="http://time.com/3630922/brazil-politics-congresswoman-rape-comments/">sexism</a> (he once told a female deputy that she was not worthy of being raped by him) and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/14/world/americas/brazil-president-candidate-hate.html">racism</a> (just this year he was charged with inciting racial hatred as a result of a lengthy catalog of hate speech). It was not until he entered the presidential race this cycle that he gained a national following. His success is in large part due to a confluence of factors beyond his control, but the sprawling Lava Jato corruption scandal, which has implicated the vast majority of Brazil’s political class, is perhaps what contributed most to the creation of fertile ground for a disruptive reactionary candidate. And indeed, Bolsonaro is campaigning primarily on a platform of anti-corruption and stability.</p>
<p class="p2">But it is Bolsonaro’s brand of so-called stability at this particular political moment in Brazil that makes his threat to Brazilian democracy so dire. Bolsonaro, a former captain in the military during the dictatorship period, is a notorious apologist for the regime, and has chosen as his running mate a former general, Antonio Hamilton Mourão, who just last year said that a <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/05/general-repudia-acao-militar-contra-governo-e-diz-que-populacao-se-torna-refem-da-greve.shtml">military coup was possible</a> in Brazil. At the same time, support for democracy as an institution in Brazil is declining in response to the sheer magnitude of the Lava Jato corruption scandal, which has penetrated all aspects of the country’s politics. In 2016, as details of the scandal came to light, popular support for democracy fell by 22 percent, from 54 percent in 2015. Fifty-five percent of Brazilians <a href="https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2017/9/19/16333360/brazilians-losing-faith-democracy">now claim</a> they would support a non-democratic form of government if it “solved problems.” Of course, it is one thing to see an emerging nostalgic mythology form around the dictatorship era, and an entirely different thing to reify that nostalgia into a real-life government. But Bolsonaro’s electoral viability provides exactly this opportunity.</p>
<p class="p2">Some sanguine commentators have tried to minimize the threat to Brazil’s democracy by <a href="http://time.com/5415039/jair-bolsonaro-brazil/">pointing out</a> that its “strong” democratic institutions will not allow a return to autocracy. This is simply not the reality. As the famous Brazilian academic Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027631">once noted</a>, “Despite democratic constitutionalism, there exists an evident legacy in state apparatuses, left by the authoritarian regime.” Just last year, for instance, when Brazil’s supreme court was deciding on whether to grant former president Lula’s request for a writ of habeas corpus while he was appealing his corruption conviction, the military’s chief of staff, Eduardo Dias da Costa Villas Bôas, ominously reminded the court and the public that “the military repudiates impunity” — a not-so-thinly-veiled attempt at threatening the court to essentially disqualify Lula, who was at the time the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-poll/brazils-lula-bolsonaro-well-positioned-for-2018-elections-poll-idUSKBN1CY0TF">most popular candidate</a> in the race by far. Shortly thereafter, Lula’s request was denied, and following his appeal, his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/brazil-on-edge-as-appeals-decision-nears-in-ex-president-lula-corruption-case/2018/01/24/e34ecccc-ff9b-11e7-86b9-8908743c79dd_story.html?utm_term=.dc72f87e1c60">sentence was increased</a> to 12 years and one month.</p>
<p class="p2">What’s more, Brazil’s elected government has itself shown very little ability to protect the regular functioning of democratic government. The 2016 impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff for budgetary manipulation has been <a href="https://www.financierworldwide.com/recent-corruption-scandals-in-brazil-and-anti-corruption-compliance-trends-for-2015/#.W7a1_xNKhBx">widely criticized</a> as an attempt by federal representatives implicated in the Lava Jato corruption scandal — <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-brazil-impeach-20160328-story.html">303 out of 513</a> in the Chamber of Deputies and 49 out of 81 members in the Senate — to replace Rousseff, who was not implicated in the scandal, with her vice president, Michel Temer, who was also under investigation for corruption and, surreally, barred at that time from running for president due to previous corruption charges. Ultimately, of the 65 members on the impeachment commission in the Chamber of Deputies, 38 voted to impeach Rousseff, and of those, 37 were <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-brazil-impeach-20160328-story.html">under investigation</a> for charges related to the Lava Jato scandal. Incidentally, when Bolsonaro voted for Rousseff’s impeachment, he dedicated his vote to Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, an infamous torturer during the military regime who died the <a href="https://blogs.ne10.uol.com.br/jamildo/2018/07/31/bolsonaro-cita-livro-de-ustra-acusado-de-tortura-como-de-cabeceira/">previous year</a>. Rousseff was<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/world/americas/president-rousseffs-decades-old-torture-detailed.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=CE6B0870554971925A52919BC0F5AA15&amp;gwt=pay"> tortured for dissident activity</a> by the military in 1970.</p>
<p class="p2">This is not to say federal deputies support a military coup — they were, by and large, looking out for themselves rather than staking out any ideological position. But the impeachment of Rousseff, the frankness of military officials in threatening the judiciary and the <a href="http://theconversation.com/presidential-corruption-verdict-shows-just-how-flawed-brazils-justice-system-is-90794">politicization of the judiciary itself</a> (which we have seen most clearly in the recent conviction of Lula) all seem to suggest that there is insufficient institutional strength to protect the country’s democracy.</p>
<p class="p2">In hindsight, it’s easy to see that Brazil has been careening toward disaster for the past few years. In fact, I have <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/cardoso-19-precarious-state-brazilian-democracy/">previously written about</a> the many threats and challenges<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/24/cardoso-19-brazils-democracy-woes/">Brazil’s democracy</a> has faced in recent years. But Brazil’s choice Sunday is a critical juncture — either another large step toward illiberalism and autocracy or a rejection of this trend, a much needed course correction. Brazil’s descent into the abyss is by no means a fait accompli. Brazil’s success during the late 1990s and 2000s has been a model for post-dictatorship countries in Latin America and throughout the world. The Brazilian people have the power to embrace that legacy. Hopefully, come this Sunday, they will be a model for saving democracy, too.</p>

		<title>Simshauser &#039;20: Can progressive values flip Texas?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the 2018 midterm elections less than a month away, much of the optimism for Democrats has been focused on the House of Representatives. This is for good reason — a “Blue Wave” is more likely to manifest in the larger sample of 435 House races, in which 432 have a Democratic candidate. Moreover, both polling and fundraising augur success for Democrats in the House; FiveThirtyEight’s forecast gives Democrats a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/?ex_cid=rrpromo">74 percent chance</a> of winning a majority of representatives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Senate, however, Democrats’ ambitions are comparatively dampened. Democratic incumbents are running in ten states won by President Trump in the 2016 election. For Democrats to seize control of the Senate, they must hold all ten races, while also gaining two seats in Sun Belt states — Tennessee, Arizona, Nevada or Texas. This geographic area is vital for the Democratic Party in the near-term, but also in terms of the broader, macro-level trends of national politics. As demographic changes rapidly alter the national electorate, Democrats can no longer rely on the predominantly white, older voter in the traditional Midwestern swing states. Instead, the most pivotal question facing Democrats — for both the midterms and beyond — is whether they can overturn the decades-long Republican hold in the Sun Belt.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Senate race in Texas, between Rep. Beto O’Rourke and incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), represents the first race in the new electoral battleground. Nowhere has the electoral landscape shifted as rapidly as it has in the Lone Star state. Once the emblem of Sun Belt conservatism, Texas’ transformation into a purple state was codified in the 2016 presidential election; Hillary Clinton<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/president"> came closer to winning in Texas</a> than she did in the apocryphal “swing state” of Iowa. For its part, the Democratic Party has invested substantially in O’Rourke’s campaign, and the campaign itself has generated enthusiasm from progressive Democrats and independents alike, thus building on his fundraising advantage. This caused the Cook Political Report to revise its forecast of Texas from “lean Republican” to “toss-up,” further concretizing the notion of Texas as a <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">battleground state</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unlike other Democratic candidates in Sun Belt states — Tennessee’s <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/23/simshauser-20-deeply-red-state-blueprint-democrats/">Phil Bredesen comes to mind</a> — O’Rourke has not branded himself as a centrist Democrat. Instead, he uncompromisingly promotes tenets of the progressive agenda. At freewheeling town halls, he advocates for gun control. He stresses the need for a single-payer health care system. And he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/aug/22/beto-orourke-nfl-protests-texas-video">praises</a> the fortitude of NFL players who knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality. But above all, his campaign’s keystone issue is immigration. Throughout his campaign, he has emphasized the need to embrace all immigrants, irrespective of their status; “The right thing to do is to legalize America,” O’Rourke has said, emphasizing that amnesty is fundamental to his message. While incumbent Democrats in red states gave ambiguous responses to Trump’s deplorable positions on immigration, O’Rourke <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/14/joe-manchin-trump-immigration-plan-408981">solidified</a> his progressive stance. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">O’Rourke’s background makes him uniquely suited to champion sweeping immigration reform. He grew up in El Paso and returned in 2005 to serve on the City Council. In 2012, he ran for Congress in the majority-Hispanic or Latino 16th district, easily winning with over 65 percent of the vote. His nickname — a Spanglish title, short for Robert — reflects the resonance of his experience growing up along the border. Indeed, Texas is an ideal state for his ambitious immigration platform. The Hispanic or Latino population, as identified by the U.S. Census, constitutes <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/tx/POP010210">39 percent of Texas</a>, almost equivalent to the 42 percent mark of non-Hispanic whites. Historically, these populations have been disproportionately represented in Texas’ electorate — white voters contributed 62 percent of votes in the 2016 presidential election. But for Beto optimists, there is a sense that the 2018 electorate will more closely resemble the actual population — by staking an admirable position of inclusion, O’Rourke will energize turnout among these underrepresented voters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The stakes of the Texas race, then, are not merely a vital seat in a closely contested Senate. Rather, it could mark an inflection point in national politics. As Republicans solidify their hold in the heartland, Democrats can run on immigration to unseat the GOP in Sun Belt states — the region where Barry Goldwater birthed modern conservatism in the 1960s. There is certainly an impetus to push for success in these states. “If Texas went blue,” Lawrence Wright <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/books/review-god-save-texas-lawrence-wright.html">espouses</a> in his recent book God Save Texas, “there would be a Democratic electoral lock on the presidency.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But reasons for a Democratic expansion into the Southwest extend beyond the political realm. While much of the country shares O’Rourke’s warm view of immigration, the Trumpified GOP has widened its attacks on immigrants and the very idea that the United States should embrace ethnic diversity. In August, Fox News host Laura Ingraham delimited the stakes for Trump supporters. “The America we know and love doesn’t exist anymore,” she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/08/09/laura-ingrahams-demographic-changes-monologue-is-rallying-cry-trumps-base/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9e9f1255187f">opined</a> in a nakedly white nationalist monologue. “Massive demographic changes have been foisted on the American people ... related to both illegal and legal immigration.” In the face of virulently nativist rhetoric, an O’Rourke victory would not only portend future success for Democrats in traditionally conservative states. It would — more importantly — signal that even in what is ostensibly “Trump country,” voters do not agree with the President’s hardline policies against immigration.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last week, Amazon announced a wage hike for all its employees — everyone, even temporary employees, would make at least $15 an hour. This is great news — more money in the pockets of workers isn’t something to dismiss. But we should be clear about one thing: It was the power of people, not the invisible hand or a sudden act of “Bezos benevolence” that made this happen. It's reasonable to expect wages to rise because the labor market in the United States is tightening. Unemployment is low, which means we ought to expect firms to offer better pay in order to attract workers. This is especially important for companies like Amazon that hire a large number of temporary workers during the holiday season.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But when Bezos announced the hike, he didn’t mention anything about competitive wages or labor market shifts. In a company blog post, Bezos <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/amazon-raises-minimum-wage-to-15-for-all-us-employees">wrote</a> this: “We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead.” The blog post also promised that Amazon would push policymakers to raise the federal minimum wage. This decision comes after months of headlines skewering the online retailer for <a href="https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/life-and-death-amazon-temp/">hellish</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-workers-share-their-horror-stories-2018-4">working conditions</a> and bad pay for warehouse employees. An Economist <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/01/20/what-amazon-does-to-wages">article</a> from January reported that when new Amazon warehouses open, they underpay their workers. This also leads to the depression of wages for employees at non-Amazon warehouses in the same area. This summer, Amazon workers in Spain, Poland, Germany, Italy and France <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/16/17577614/amazon-prime-day-strike-boycotts">went on a strike</a> to protest poor conditions. And the employees of Whole Foods, a new Amazon subsidiary, are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/whole-foods-employees-want-to-unionize-under-amazon-ownership.html">currently moving</a> to unionize. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Suppose we assume the wage hike was purely a response to a tight labor market. If this is the case, how are we to explain Amazon’s newfound position that the federal minimum wage is too low? I submit the following to you: Amazon was feeling the heat for their bad behavior and decided it was time to make different choices.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Real wages have been <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/">stagnant</a> for decades and labor unions, one of the primary avenues through which workers have fought for better pay and better working conditions, have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/23/385843576/50-years-of-shrinking-union-membership-in-one-map">slowly eroded</a> over the last 50 years. Changes in hiring practices are making it much more difficult to collectivize. Rather than hiring, training and maintaining their own workforce, companies are increasingly relying on third party contractors and temporary workers to function. According to Alan Kreuger, a professor of economics at Princeton and researcher for the National Bureau of Economic Research, this <a href="https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2018/papersandhandouts/824180824kruegerremarks.pdf?la=en">erosion of collective bargaining</a> goes a long way in explaining why wage growth has been empirically weak even when unemployment is low.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Amazon’s recent bow to pressure from workers, media and the public signals something important. If people are loud enough together, we can make a difference. My hope is that the Amazon wage hike is the beginning of something bigger — a renewed reminder that workers don’t have to be powerless against even the largest of corporations. Bezos, like the CEOs of many other corporations, <a href="http://time.com/956/how-amazon-crushed-the-union-movement/">has tried</a> (and continues to try, as the case is with Whole Foods) to push back against unionization efforts. But when workers organize, workers win. Union employees <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2013/04/art2full.pdf">make more money and have access to more benefits</a> than their non-union counterparts. If we want the world to be a better place for working people, we can help make it that way by supporting unions and helping workers demand better from corporate giants.</span></p>

		<title>Steinman &#039;19: When writing a thesis, learn from your peers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For many incoming students, the first tangible links to Brown are advisors, people who will be guiding and looking out for us from the moment we reach campus and begin to pick classes. In addition to our academic advisors, first-years are surrounded by all forms of student-led guidance: Meiklejohns, Residential Peer Leaders, Minority and Women Peer Counselors and Writing Center Fellows, to name a few. As we move through our college years, we learn to better navigate our own paths and get our assignments done, and so the relative importance of those advisors begins to fade away. We find our rhythms, self-sufficient Brown students that we are, and figure things out on our own.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And then we hit senior year and are confronted with a question of almost mythic import: to write a thesis or not? And, if we are to undertake the task, where to begin? What to write about? How long does it have to be, and when is it due? What is original research, anyway?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I didn’t know the answer to a single one of these questions when my friends and classmates started throwing their own ideas and outlines around. I met with advisors in my concentration to gain answers to the logistical questions, as well as some moral support. But I still felt, and continue to feel, that I was lacking the perspective of someone who had actually been through the process. That is the major gap in the University’s otherwise comprehensive advising network: a thesis peer advisor, a recent grad from the same concentration who has written a thesis and made it out alive.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The advising system will always work better for some than others. Some students mesh well with their assigned advisors (whether they are peers or professors), some are more inclined to seek out informal mentors of their own and some prefer to forego the advising process entirely and make it up as they go. For students who have close friends who graduated recently and were in the same concentration, this system may well be unnecessary. But a dedicated resource, particularly one who volunteered for the role, can be useful in ways that friends sometimes cannot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The program need not be complicated. At the end of the spring semester, faculty (or even Department Undergraduate Group leaders) in each concentration would reach out to graduating seniors who wrote theses and ask if they would be willing to give a rising senior their phone number. For a handful of hours a month, that alum would make themselves available to check in and answer questions. (Whether or not to respond to late-night panic sessions would be at the peer advisor’s discretion.) Research and writing, though independent in nature, can always benefit from a listening ear. A thesis peer advisor could share insight about where they were this time last year, discussing times when they wanted to quit or felt like they had backed themselves into a corner. They can suggest new sources or citation tools and provide a type of motivation and counseling that can be hard to find from professors, no matter how accessible they make themselves. It would help recent grads keep their ties to Brown, and seniors would have access to a role model not just for their thesis, but for navigating those first terrifying postgrad years in their chosen field.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the most disorienting things about becoming a senior is the lack of institutional memory passed down to us. In clubs and on teams, it’s up to us to maintain traditions and knowledge and to lead in the best way we know how. In most facets of our college lives, from classes to extracurriculars, we’re ready for this; we’ve been learning how to take the reins for the past three and a half years. But the thesis process is entirely new, and everyone who has been through it has left College Hill behind, leaving no one to offer their hard-earned wisdom. A peer advisor program would make the wall between senior year and postgrad life somewhat less impermeable, while rendering one of the biggest challenges we undertake in our college years more manageable. The thesis is an exciting opportunity for seniors to delve deep into their interests and create a work of independent scholarship — but that doesn’t mean we have to do it all on our own.</span></p>

		<title>Calvelli &#039;19: Exploration/No Credit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Oct. 2, the Sastifactory/No Credit deadline passed without much fanfare. Forty-nine years after its inception, the S/NC option is so ingrained in the Brown experience that it doesn’t stand out as abnormal. That’s a problem. S/NC is truly unique; Brown is one of just a handful of schools that allows its students to take all of their classes without letter grades. By doing so, Brown is making the argument — simple, but radical to us students who got here in large part due to our transcripts — that a liberal education can be measured by more than letters.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This noble possibility is often muddled amid the practical realities of being a student. It’s time we resuscitate an ideal of S/NC focused on encouraging students to learn freely and follow their academic passions without regard for how they’ll be graded. To promote the idea that S/NC lets us focus more on the learning journey than the end result, I propose we give it a new name: Exploration/No Credit. The label attributed to success in S/NC courses — “Satisfactory” — invokes no high ideal of learning. But I want my education to be more than that! In an ideal world, I would be more motivated by the prospect of intellectual growth and discovery than by having someone tell me I did OK. Of course, S/NC has pragmatic value as well, allowing students to prioritize coursework and stress less about assignments. Yet I think we miss out on S/NC’s important philosophical purpose when these pragmatic concerns form the dominant S/NC narrative. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sure, just changing the name won’t tangibly affect the grading option, and a new moniker won’t require students to take a new approach to their education. But that doesn’t mean we can’t help realize the ideals of S/NC by giving it a rhetorical update that explicitly promotes a non-grade-oriented approach to learning. Having “Satisfactory” as the current benchmark conveys that the goal of a class is to simply to perform adequately. “Satisfactory” does get out of the letter grade framework, but in reality, “S” is just a stand-in grade, a perfect substitute for an A, B or C.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Exploration,” however corny it may sound, instead conveys the idea that when freed from the shackles of grades, learning can be an exploratory, individualized and empowering endeavor. “Exploration” is an aspiration, a reminder that the personal growth from our classes is incommensurable with the information ingested while cramming for Midterm 2. An “E” on a transcript would signify more than just a milquetoast, satisfactory performance; it would gesture at how the course inspired you to think differently and reimagine your approach to learning.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To be clear, changing the name to Exploration/No Credit would not be intended to stigmatize or denigrate a more practical approach to E/NC. Students can legitimately use the option to, for example, prioritize certain classes, reduce their stress about grades, do assignments on their own timelines or free their schedules for important extracurricular pursuits. That’s the privilege of the freedom Brown’s curriculum offers; students are entrusted to make of their educations what they wish.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">However, it’s also consistent with Brown’s curriculum to try to inspire idealism in the way we think about grades and learning. Maybe calling it Exploration/No Credit won’t radically change our approach to education, but if reframing the option as E/NC inspires one person to work hard in a class for reasons unattached to A’s, I think it would be a success.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I certainly would benefit from that nudge. When I chose to take BIOL 0030: “Principles of Nutrition” S/NC, I told myself I did so because I cared more about cultivating my interest in food than about getting any grade. But after failing the first test, my idealism for learning quickly transformed into a desperate rush for an S. Had the grade option instead been “Exploration,” I at least would have had a constant reminder to stay true to the reasons originally motivating my learning, rather than feeling like I had to meet a satisfactory threshold of memorization.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The more we can do to normalize E/NC as a tool for intellectual growth and exploration, the better. When students get to Brown, they’ve just emerged from a pressure cooker high school in which a single bad grade seemed like the gap between themselves and the Ivy League. If we work early on to disentangle education from grading, we’ll remind students — who inevitably will receive some grades they’ve never seen before in college — that growth is a healthier goal than perfection.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Though students here are independent, we are all shaped by the opinions and attitudes of those around us. Characterizing S/NC as a way to avoid bad grades is unproductive because that gives grades a power and importance that S/NC aspires to move beyond. When it’s standard practice for Meiklejohn Peer Advisors to tell first-years to take their hard classes S/NC, I’m worried that students’ first introduction to the option will crowd out its idealistic purpose and make it seem like just a value-neutral pass/fail option. Calling the successful completion of that option “Exploration” signals that E/NC can stand for more than a workload-management tool.</span></p>
<p class="p3">I remember how inspiring it was to hear former Dean of the College Maud Mandel tell our class during orientation about the possibilities the Open Curriculum afforded us and how S/NC was one of the many tools at our disposal to shape our learning experience. We may not have Mandel anymore (side note: please come back. I miss you). But we can rename S/NC to Exploration/No Credit to remind us that despite the ubiquity of grades and the stress they induce, at Brown we have the privilege of learning beyond letters. Let’s not forget to explore that opportunity.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most undergrads who have applied to an organization outside of Brown — virtually everyone — have had to take the annoying step of calculating their GPA. In the spirit of its unique educational philosophy, Brown refuses to calculate GPA; but other organizations, obviously, do not share this philosophy. Whether applying to study-abroad, to law school or to a plethora of internships, one can usually count on the organization to request a GPA from its applicants. Brown’s denial of GPA is ideological but impractical, romantic but inefficient. For the sake of efficiency and accuracy, Brown ought to include GPA in undergraduate transcripts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of the various idiosyncrasies of the Open Curriculum, the denial of GPA is unique in that it has an exclusively ideological purpose. The lack of requirements outside a concentration, the grading without plusses and minuses and the option for S/NC all have real effects on an undergrad’s education. They allow undergrads to take whatever courses they wish, with reduced pressure to succeed and with more room to experiment. The denial of GPA, like the rest of these, is supposed to symbolize Brown’s commitment to its distinctive liberal education. But in practice it has no effect on the education, for the simple reason that undergrads still worry just as much about their GPA as they otherwise would, knowing that the outside world will probably evaluate them by such a metric.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anecdotally, many undergrads at Brown are as conscious of their GPA as undergrads elsewhere. They may be more willing to take academic risks, but they still check their grades anxiously. They are excited to explore a new class or two, but they still feel the pain when a new class ends ups desecrating an otherwise pristine transcript. For they know that GPA will, indeed, matter for them upon graduation, even if it does not matter now. Whether or not Brown calculates GPA, many undergrads themselves will still fret over them. Brown therefore seems to be deluding itself by denying the weight that undergrads actually give to GPA.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">CareerLAB, too, understands the practical necessity of GPA. It gives the following instructions to those using Handshake, a career placement tool: “Some employers in Handshake (about 10 percent) have a strict cutoff when it comes to GPA. If you don’t meet that threshold, you are likely not to be chosen for an interview. For that reason, we recommend all students include their GPA (self-calculated) in their profile. The vast majority of employers look at a combination of factors and do not weigh GPA so heavily.” Also, 13 of the 17 sample resumes on CareerLAB’s website contain a GPA. Since more often than not undergrads will eventually need to calculate their GPA anyway, why can’t Brown just do so for them?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The main problem with Brown’s denial of GPA, if I am to be honest, is the nuisance that it imposes on undergrads, who must go through the trouble themselves of calculating their GPA. But beyond the mere nuisance, GPA calculated by students also lends itself to unintentional or even deliberate errors. Calculating together the myriad classes, one could err in properly weighting a course or could deliberately write a higher number. Without an official GPA on the transcript, an employer who does not want to spend the time calculating a GPA would simply believe the number written on the top of the resume. An official verification would prevent the possibility of such errors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown needs to accept the reality of the GPA. To pretend that it does not exist does not make them vanish. By putting aside its lofty principles, in this case, for more practical concerns, Brown could do its undergrads a small but convenient favor.</span></p>

		<title>Friedman &#039;19: Edge College Hill is not perfect — just pragmatic</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">If you’re a sophomore or a junior, you’re probably already in the process of looking for a place to live next year. The current state of apartment hunting in Providence is reminiscent of the recruiting cycle — it happens earlier and earlier every year, and chances are that all of your friends signed last week. It’s time for you to pick up the pieces, but all of your options are overpriced and involve walls with <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/22/savello-18-reslife-fails-upperclassmen/">peeling paint</a>. Luckily, there is <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/12/student-luxury-housing-developers-save-19-million-20-years/">Edge College Hill II</a>, that new luxury apartment tower going up near the Rhode Island School of Design — if you’re breaking the bank on this apartment, it might as well be worth it, right? Well, according to multiple prominent local advocacy groups, two city councilors-elect and an incumbent city councilwoman, by doing so, you would be implicated in a morally degenerate operation that prioritizes rich students <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/live/dare-steeple-street-tsa-opposition">over low-income residents</a>. Wow, having principles sucks sometimes, doesn’t it? Guess the stuffy, reclaimed attic unit with no windows just won your housing lottery, whether you like it or not.</p>
<p class="p3">Forgive my sarcasm, but I believe the scenario I described is somewhat accurate. Student housing is a perennial problem for multiple parties — the University, the City of Providence, community groups and, of course, students. For the University (specifically, the Office of Residential Life), student housing is a lose-lose situation. The University is required to provide housing, yet doing so is unprofitable and a frequent point of criticism — taking the proverbial dump on ResLife has been a rite of passage for Herald opinions writers for a while. The City of Providence attempts to balance multiple interests, such as providing affordable housing as dictated by its Comprehensive Plan, providing legal housing for students, promoting investment in the city and making money from taxes. It’s hard to satisfy one interest without <a href="https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Planning-ProvidenceTomorrowFinal_November2014.pdf">compromising another</a>. Community groups, namely Direct Action for Rights and Equality, want city funds to be repurposed for low-income housing. And students want a nice place to live that doesn’t break the bank. The city, whose regulations determine what actually happens, is stuck between a rock and a hard place, and its decision to provide Edge College Hill’s developers a tax break does not deserve the criticism it has received.</p>
<p class="p3">The Providence City Council recently approved a tax agreement that saves the developer of the 163-unit apartment building $19 million over 20 years. Evidently, the city council decided to solve the city investment, student housing and tax revenue problems at the expense of the affordable housing one. Its logic makes sense. According to City Council Majority Leader, John Igliozzi, the building’s tax revenue — even with the tax agreement — far exceeds the $40,000 per year the city was receiving from the parking lot currently there. In all seriousness, the developers would likely not have constructed Edge College Hill II without a <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20181004/providence-city-council-oks-tax-agreement-for-apartment-project">tax incentive</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Given the alternatives the city faced — likely, overcrowded student housing or new Brown and RISD student housing buildings that are <a href="http://realestate.boston.com/news/2018/07/24/providence-considers-student-housing-cap/">exempt from property taxes</a> — the City Council’s decision doesn’t seem so bad. If anything, the Edge apartments may siphon business from the 257 Thayer<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>complex and similar offerings in the area, lowering the overall price for student housing by introducing competitive new supply. The city clearly has a lot to gain from the deal.</p>
<p class="p3">What the city has to lose is its reputation, which is currently being challenged by DARE. In a letter written to the City Council after the tax agreement vote, DARE criticized the city for diverting funds from public works (such as repairs to roadways and schools, recreational programs) and negotiating a bad deal with the developers, and instead suggests that City Council implement “real” affordable housing, inclusionary zoning laws and local hiring. This criticism is flawed because it is near-sighted. First of all, by negotiating a deal with the developers, the city acquired a new source of revenue that it will then be able to repurpose for public works. The $40,000 collected per year from the current parking lot — though it may not “take resources away from our communities” — cannot compare with the millions the city will gain per year from the Edge building. Why have less money when you can have more? It’s not like this approach to development in the city is without precedent: The Providence Place Mall is still reaping the benefits of a 30-year property tax abatement negotiated after its construction. It seems that a 20-year agreement is simply the <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160611/providence-place-malls-tax-deal-saves-owners-bundle">going rate</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">On the other hand, the letter’s policy suggestions are compelling, and this building will probably introduce gentrification-related problems. The city currently does not have an inclusionary zoning clause in its zoning ordinance despite professing its commitment to affordable housing at multiple points in its current<a href="http://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/18-07-27OfficialZoningOrdinance.pdf"> Comprehensive Plan</a>. The building may also raise overall prices in the Canal Street area to a level that will price-out some existing residents, an equity issue that the city will have a tough time addressing. Either it will have to intervene through <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/how-public-housing-harms-cities-12410.html">rent control</a> or public housing — both of which<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html"> fail often</a> since landlords and the government have little financial incentive to maintain their properties, and public housing often isolates its residents financially and socially. Though nonprofit intervention could also remediate the problem, the city has little control over deciding whether an altruist ultimately intervenes. Providence may not have the right answer here, but I don’t think any U.S. city does either.</p>
<p class="p3">In short, the city is doing the best it can with the tools at its disposal. Though the current solution isn’t perfect, it is the best one out a short list of options. Students should not have to feel bad about themselves for choosing to live in Edge, and the city should not feel bad for allowing it to happen either.</p>

		<title>Fernandez &#039;21: The language of Latinx</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A discussion I have been particularly interested in and that I have seen arise constantly among students and faculty at Brown is the discussion on the intricacies of language, especially in regard to its essential role in framing the way we view and interact with our circumstances. Recently, these questions about language have been reflected in the widespread and heated issue of the label of “Latinx” to refer to people living in the United States who have Latin American heritage. It is a term that has become extremely popular, especially among college students, and one that has, nevertheless, been a major point of controversy across several fields. The term Latinx and its associated discourse raise questions about identity, authority and privilege that are complicated and reliant on a vast and varying knowledge of distinct cultural realities that very few people possess. However, while the answer to exactly how we should react to a label like Latinx is uncertain, one thing becomes exceedingly clear: The language we use affects the ways certain peoples are perceived and treated. Furthermore, an active consciousness about this fact is essential in order to responsibly participate in any discussion about the implications of the language of Latinx.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Americans have always possessed a strong desire for an umbrella term for immigrants from Latin American countries. The appropriateness of a term of this nature has been under scrutiny for decades. It is not specific to the new label of Latinx, but was discussed for previously popular labels such as Latino and Hispanic. I will exclude this discussion for the time being for two primary reasons. First, I think there exists some degree of solidarity among immigrants from different Latin American countries that might warrant this kind of term. Take the existence of the Latin-American Students Organization at Brown, for example. Second, I would prefer to focus instead on the more recent arguments that have emerged in specific reference to the language of Latinx.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The term Latinx appeared in the academic world to promote gender inclusivity as an alternative to the limiting “Latino” or “Latina” that imply male or female gender, respectively. This effort not only stems from good intentions, but has also sparked a productive discussion about the problems associated with heteronormativity. However, Latin Americans across the United States have expressed concern over other implications the Latinx label denotes that are worth mentioning. The primary critics understand and respect the push toward inclusivity, but highlight the potentially exclusionary exercise of the term. Opponents point out that Spanish is an inherently gendered language that provides a gender to all nouns. Changing from Latina to Latinx involves the imposition of English syntax onto a Spanish word. Furthermore, such a change is inaccessible to native Spanish speakers with little access to English, a characteristic of a significant portion of the demographic that would themselves be expected to identify as Latinx. In addition, while the term has become very popular, it was originally developed in the elite, academic sphere and disseminated in a top-down fashion. Such a process always entails implications about power over identity. Very few people in Latin America use this language, for they, of course, predominantly use Spanish or Portuguese. While it is not a particularly inaccessible word, it continues to be most frequently employed by highly educated youth in the United States who are not necessarily representative of what the “Latinx community” is understood to be.</span></p>
<p class="p2">It is interesting to consider the term Latinx in comparison to the ways in which Latin Americans refer to people in the United States. The word in Spanish for person from the United States is “estadounidense.” There is no such word in English, where a person from the United States is referred to as simply “American.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For Latin Americans, the term “American” or “americano” encompasses all people from the Americas, including themselves. I argue that this seemingly trivial difference reflects a very serious historical legacy about the relationship between the United States and the rest of the American continents. This legacy is manifested in the fact that the United States asserts itself as the default “American,” while this position — and the claim to authority behind it — is challenged in Spanish. If we recognize this possibility, we must also recognize how the term Latinx might reinforce this power dynamic in addition to the ways it mediates the relationship between Latin Americans living in Latin America and those living in the United States.</p>
<p class="p2">This relationship is extremely complicated and controversial, involving too many intricate and varying perspectives to responsibly deconstruct in this space. However, I will say that a strong argument that the imposition of not only the English tradition, but also the accompanying U.S.-centric intellectual agenda, onto the word “Latino” may serve to reflect a legacy of privileging certain Latin American voices over others. It has traditionally been the voices of upper class, highly educated and predominantly white Latin Americans who have seen the most development in their influence on U.S. discourse. It becomes important to question how emerging popular language privileges the Latinx over the Latin American.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have personally employed the language of Latinx in my colloquial speech as well as in my previous articles for this very publication, primarily due to the fact that there exist so few alternatives when speaking or writing in English. Furthermore, I do not make the claim that Latinx is an inherently problematic term. I only seek to suggest that we should be conscious of the power dynamics reflected in our language and how we might unknowingly perpetuate them.</span></p>

		<title>Thomas &#039;21: Brown must keep alive the legacy of the 1968 walkout — and act on it</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A few weeks ago, the University hosted the 2018 edition of the Black Alumni Reunion weekend.<a href="https://brunonia.brown.edu/alumni/article/black-alumni-reunion-2018"> This reunion</a> was particularly special as the year 2018 marks 50 years since the 1968 student walkout by black students from Brown and Pembroke College. The weekend was filled with events celebrating black alums of the University. The energy on campus was tangible. But, when the weekend came to an end, everything went back to normal. These three days — filled with so much joy and appreciation for the history of black students and, especially, black student activists — were but a moment in time. This shouldn’t be the case. While every day can’t be Black Alumni Reunion weekend, the acknowledgement and appreciation of black students at Brown — along with the pursuit of the goals laid out by student protests in 1968 — should be ongoing, rather than packed into one weekend that happens every so often.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the main events during the BAR Weekend was the First Annual Black Convocation. The event served to welcome black first-year students to Brown. Manning Chapel was packed with first-years, upperclassmen and alums. It was a beautiful event; welcoming black first-year students to Brown in this manner each year is a true commitment to ensuring a positive experience for black students. But the impetus for this event came from students. The Black Student Union <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1955844984479738/">spearheaded the initiative</a> and received support from various groups and offices to make the event run smoothly. Students on campus are constantly spearheading initiatives and planning events that don’t get the same kind of exposure that the First Annual Black Convocation did. A weekend isn’t enough time to adequately acknowledge black student activism at Brown. What’s more is that the University administration often receives the praise for such initiatives while the work of students may go unnoticed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recognition of black students, the enduring legacy of black alums and the work they’ve done to make the University what it is today should be a normal, ongoing part of campus life. Rather than trying to cover all these bases in one weekend, Brown should be more proactive and consistent in showing that it cherishes the rich history and contributions of its black students and black student activism. As stated earlier, it’s been 50 years since the 1968 walkout and Brown has made the moment a part of its <a href="https://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/articles/2018-07-15/a-diversity-milestone">institutional self-image.</a> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">However, if the University wants to show that it cares about the walkout in the present, its leaders might consider looking at the demands made by the student protestors in 1968, and seeing which of them have not yet been met. To meet the demands of the students that Brown so greatly appreciated during the BAR Weekend would be a great way for the University to show how much it actually values its black student population. For example, Brown might next consider looking at its proportion of black students in relation to its Ivy League peers and increase that number like the 1968 demands stipulated. While black students constitute 15 percent of college-aged Americans, the University’s freshman class in 2015 was only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/24/us/affirmative-action.html">8 percent black</a>. In comparison, the students who walked out in 1968 <a href="http://blogs.brown.edu/ethn-0790d-s01/2014/12/07/the-1968-black-student-walkout-setting-the-stage/">demanded</a> that the incoming class of 1973 be at least 11 percent black. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the point of Brown being more proactive, earlier this year racist flyers were posted around campus, which resulted in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/22/university-releases-statement-regarding-racist-flyers/">two press conferences</a>. These press conferences were not organized by the administration, and an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/28/editorial-universitys-response-racist-flyers-came-late/">official statement</a> from the University came more than two weeks after the fliers were first discovered. Brown students shouldn’t have to force the University to care about them and wait two weeks for the administration to take a stand against displays of racism and prejudice in the community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A major step in the right direction was taken during BAR Weekend this year with the renaming of the J. Walter Wilson building to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/23/black-alumni-connect-celebrate-reunion/">Page-Robinson Hall</a>. To have a building on campus that memorializes two black graduates of Brown is a real, conspicuous way for the University to integrate the history of black students on College Hill into campus conversations and dialogue. Yet there’s still work that remains to be done in fulfilling the aspirations of earlier generations of Brunonians who fought to make Brown a more inclusive, more just place. All Brown students should have an experience here that fosters nothing less the maximization of our potential. Walking around campus with the knowledge that your university cares about you is critical to feeling empowered and being able to learn. Creating events and renaming buildings is a great start in the process of making black students at Brown feel seen and supported — but we cannot afford to be complacent. We must make the pursuit of justice and the acknowledgement of Brown’s history a living, dynamic and continual part of campus life. As <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2009/03/02/group-recalls-68-walkout-past-of-student-activism/">Ido Jamar ’69</a> ScM ’74 PhD’77, one of the students who walked out in 1968, said, “We realized something was not right here. It either had to be made right or we could no longer be here.” </span></p>

		<title>Aman &#039;20: Elizabeth Warren’s DNA test misses the mark</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) released a series of videos discussing her Native American heritage, as well a DNA test that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/politics/elizabeth-warren-dna-test-native-american/index.html">concluded she had a Native American ancestor six to ten generations back</a>. Though Warren took this DNA test in response to racist taunts from President Trump and others on the right, using a DNA test as proof of identity ultimately reinforces harmful ideas that ground race in biological differences.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fraught relationship between genetics and race is not new: Genetics has been used to <a href="http://theconversation.com/how-science-has-been-abused-through-the-ages-to-promote-racism-50629">justify racist ideologies</a> essentially since it has existed as a field. Though scientists and anthropologists now agree that race is a <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/science-genetics-reshaping-race-debate-21st-century/">social, rather than biological, construct</a>, the rising popularity of genetic testing services is bringing old ideas about race and biology back to the forefront. To be clear, genetic tests cannot tell anyone that their genome is a specific percent of any race or ethnicity, because there aren’t any genes that all black people share, for example. Rather, some genetic markers are significantly more common in some races and ethnicities than others, which genetic testing companies use to make estimates. Unfortunately, this nuance has been lost in translation. For instance, one man recently sued the federal government, claiming his small business should be classified as minority-owned because a DNA test estimated his ancestry was four percent sub-Saharan African and six percent indigenous American. More worryingly, white supremacists are using the language of genetics to further their cause. In 2017, for example, a group of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/us/white-supremacists-science-dna.html">white supremacists posted a video of members chugging milk</a>, highlighting the gene that allows adults to digest lactose, which is more common in white people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By submitting to a DNA test, Warren legitimized this discourse connecting race and genetics. Though she did not claim to have any particular percentage of Native American “blood,” and DNA isn’t passed down equally from all ancestors, that didn’t stop the Boston Globe and the Republican National Committee from attempting to calculate percentages. As Masha Gessen argued in an <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/elizabeth-warren-falls-for-trumps-trap-and-promotes-insidious-ideas-about-race-and-dna?mbid=social_facebook">opinion</a> for the New Yorker, by releasing a DNA test,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Warren is “reinforcing one of the most insidious ways in which Americans talk about race: as though it were a measurable biological category, one that, in some cases, can be determined by a single drop of blood."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many Native Americans are angry about Warren’s actions, and the Cherokee Nation publicly condemned her use of the DNA test, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-dna-test.html">explaining</a> that by emphasizing ancestry rather than tribal membership, DNA testing is “privileging nonindigenous definitions of being indigenous.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some might argue that Warren is not at fault, as she was simply responding to Trump, who called her racist names and promised to donate $1 million to charity if she got a DNA test (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/411414-trump-denies-offering-1-million-for-warren-dna-test-even-though-he">a promise he abandoned</a>) . And to be clear, we should absolutely criticize Trump for this despicable, racist behavior. Yet Warren amplified the situation by releasing the genetic test; the fact that Trump “started it” doesn’t excuse her actions. Ultimately, taking a DNA test as “proof” of Native American heritage is bad for Americans’ understanding of both race and genetics. By giving racial discrimination a basis in “science,” this misunderstanding has tangible and sometimes tragic consequences.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Now in my fourth (and final) year at Brown, I thought nothing could surprise me. Naked people with donuts? Sure. Neil deGrasse Tyson chilling on Simmons Quad? Boring. Yet on a recent dreary mid-October day, I was proven wrong when I saw not one, but two first-years with lanyards around their necks.</p>
<p class="p2">That’s right. We’re more than a month into school, and the lanyards haven’t all been relegated to the pockets of history. Yes, there are still first-years strutting across Pembroke Green, unaware of the silent ridicule they are subjecting themselves to.</p>
<p class="p2">But a couple days ago, it hit me. Maybe these lanyard-wearing first-years aren’t the mockable ones. Maybe it’s me. Yes, I, a wise senior, steeped for four years in our lanyards-are-a-weird-orientation-week-freshman-fad culture, had it wrong. I now see that lanyard-wearers are unapologetically themselves, undeterred by a campus of hegemonically anti-lanyard conformity. Lanyard-critiquers like myself, however, have been stripped of our innocence and openness.</p>
<p class="p2">You might, dear reader, think that I’m overemphasizing the decision to place a goofy-looking necklace around one’s neck. Think again. The lanyard is a form of symbolic self-expression, revealing both the character of the one wearing it and the condescension of those judging it. On the surface, the campus is divided into the lanyard-wearing minority and the lanyard-averse majority; on the inside, we’re split into those freely expressing their purity and those pushed into insecure, jaded conformity by paralyzing perceptions of popularity.</p>
<p class="p2">Clearly, my fixation on lanyard-wearers indicates I have some repressed feelings worth exploring. When I judge them with some vague insult of ridiculousness, it’s possible (read: definitely true) that I’m projecting an insecurity that they have something I’ve lost.</p>
<p class="p2">To figure out what that is, I thought back to the last time I wore a lanyard: first-year orientation week. I have no recollection of why I wore the lanyard then. Perhaps, after moving away from my parents, the soft fabric against my neck was a comforting reminder of a motherly embrace. Perhaps in my fear of social isolation, I copied the superficial appearance of my peers who had yet to abandon their own lanyards.</p>
<p class="p2">It’s likely that I can’t remember exactly why I wore the lanyard because I didn’t have a conscious reason. Caught up in the thrill of being at Brown, too unaware of aesthetic norms to realize I looked silly, wearing the lanyard was just something I did.</p>
<p class="p2">In those first few days on campus, we occupy a liminal space between our past selves and the people we will become at Brown. Unschooled in Brown’s culture, unthinking of much beyond “adjusting,” in the early lanyard days, we have a beautifully authentic naivete. It is not the self-possessed authenticity we gain as we grow as individuals in college. Rather, it’s a blank-slate authenticity, where we enter a new world unsure of what to make of ourselves and our surroundings and in that uncertainty, we are forced simply to be.</p>
<p class="p2">Soon we grow out of the lanyard, and over time we transform from wide-eyed first-years into quasi-adult, fully-fledged Brunonians. That transformation is mostly good: We learn about ourselves and the world, meet lifelong friends and integrate into this special college community. Seniors, in general, don’t wish they were first-years.</p>
<p class="p2">Still, I think something important is lost as Brown culture infuses itself into our identities. No longer are our college lives mysteries waiting to be unfurled. The possibilities of what Brown could be become memories of what it was, the dreamscape entered by walking through the Van Wickle Gates punctured by late nights in the library, broken hearts and that one November morning two years ago.</p>
<p class="p2">Today, I barely recognize that nervous, hopeful Aidan with a ratty Brown lanyard. Yet as my brain is occupied now with thesis research instead of the Sharpe Refectory lunch menu, I’m struck by how rare that first week was. We join a new community, excited and terrified to together embark on a journey of self-discovery with contours we genuinely cannot predict. And though we might not have known it then, our lanyards were a critical step on that journey, a symbol of a simpler time, one imbued with seemingly infinite possibility, unmarred by practical tribulations, embodying a beautiful innocence.</p>
<p class="p2">So, when we see first-years bearing lanyards, we would do well not to judge, for they share a spirit that time has stolen from our grasp. To all the lanyard-wearing first-years I’ve pitied in my head, I’m sorry. You, in some inexpressible way, know yourself better than I do. Maybe it’s you who should be sorry for me.</p>

		<title>Allums &#039;21: MPC Workshop “Are You Problematic?” is for all of us</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A few weeks ago, a group of Minority Peer Counselors hosted one of several planned workshops designed to address issues facing racial and ethnic minorities at Brown. The workshop, entitled “Are You Problematic?”, came in the wake of the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/23/black-alumni-connect-celebrate-reunion/">Black Alumni Reunion</a> that had taken place two weeks prior. This reunion was particularly significant, as 2018 marks 50 years since the 1968 walkout staged by black students from Brown and Pembroke College to pressure the University to increase the admission of black applicants. The MPCs who organized the workshop highlighted that there is more work to be done to build upon this legacy, half a century later, and engaged the attendees in brainstorming efforts that Brown ought to pursue to make amends for its racist history.</p>
<p class="p2">Apparently, not everyone approved of the topic of the workshop. On the day the event was to take place, an anonymous student taped a note reading “It’s okay to be white” on an advertisement for the workshop posted under Wayland Arch. It is important to note that nowhere in the ad were white students addressed specifically. The workshop was not meant to impress upon students that it is not okay to be white. It seems that the anonymous author made the misguided assumption that the term “problematic” in the title must inherently mean “white.” Given that there was nothing in the ad that explicitly mentioned white people, one should wonder how and why this anonymous student managed to arrive at this conclusion.</p>
<p class="p2">We have seen others make similar false equivalencies on a larger scale. When Colin Kaepernick first took a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black people, opponents exploded on social media with criticisms because they saw a protest against America itself. Similar conflations have also been made regarding gender. With the rise of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>#MeToo and the increasing awareness of sexual assault against women, a number of men have felt unfairly targeted and even endangered by the movement, thus prompting the hashtag #NotAllMen. This “not all ___”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sentiment is apparent in race relations in broader society and locally on Brown’s campus.</p>
<p class="p2">The message taped to the MPC ad reflects the misguided view that by using “white people” as an umbrella term in discussions about racism, white students are being unfairly lumped together with those who participate in very explicit, dangerous forms of racism such as white nationalism. There are those who feel as if they are being guilt-tripped into accepting responsibility for problems that they do not actively contribute to. It is important to recognize, however, that racism does not always manifest in extreme ways. Yes, there are institutional demonstrations of racism such as mass incarceration and discriminatory voting laws in certain states, but racism is also present in daily interpersonal habits, such as dating “preferences” based on race and arguing that people of color have an advantage in college admission processes by virtue of being minorities.</p>
<p class="p2">There is currently debate over whether or not everyone, not just white people, can be racist. The question is whether racism is a systemic phenomenon, or if it consists of any instance of insulting or discriminating against another person based on their racial identity. I argue that while all forms of racism are discriminatory, not all forms of discrimination represent racism. Racism is a system which depends on the power to undermine the status of another race in society. For example, racialized name-calling toward a white person by a person of color does not qualify as racism since people of color do not stand in a position of power where this action can promote their superior status in a larger systemic hierarchy.</p>
<p class="p2">Both white people and people of color can, however, be problematic. The term problematic in this context encompasses any behavior that reflects prejudiced stereotypes and beliefs one holds about another person based on their race. Unlike racism, this prejudice is not contingent on coming from a position of power. The title of the MPC workshop is an invitation to students of all backgrounds to examine ways in which they may unknowingly exercise problematic habits. Rather than take the topic of the MPC workshop personally as an attack against white students, it would be far more productive to utilize the workshop for its intended purpose of improving one’s self-awareness and getting comfortable with confronting and correcting problematic behavior.</p>

		<title>Foster &#039;19: Don’t paywall local election information</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/23/foster-19-dont-paywall-local-election-information/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Compared to other countries, voter turnout in the United States is dismal. Of all age groups in this country, millenials are the worst at showing up to vote. Clearly voting isn’t the only kind of civic engagement available to us, but it’s one option among many that is important to participate in. But bombarding people with reminders to vote isn’t enough to increase turnout — we should also make sure that the barriers to being an informed member of the electorate are as low as possible for everyone.</p>
<p class="p2">When I was filling out my absentee ballot this weekend, I didn’t recognize either of the names under the sheriff’s race, so I took to the internet and googled both names. The first few results were news articles about the race from a local paper’s website, but when I clicked to read, the information was locked behind a paywall.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Free, widely accessible candidate information is especially important in races that are non-partisan, and it’s impossible to know what a candidate’s ideological bent might be without doing your research. Perhaps state and local government websites could ask each candidate to fill out a standardized questionnaire, and then make the results public. (This is what the Minnesota State Bar Association does — for each contested judicial race, candidates reply to a questionnaire and then the Association posts the results on their website.) But this still seems insufficient to me: It’s easy for a candidate to make themselves look good when they’re filling out a survey about themselves. It’s not enough to just take what candidates say at face value. We need people fact-checking and evaluating election claims and faithfully presenting them to the electorate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Margins at local newspapers are narrow —I get that — but it seems unlikely to me that newspapers would lose out in any meaningful capacity by making candidate profiles free to access for everyone. Providing people the information they need to choose the candidate that most closely aligns with their values is vitally important. It’s the job of the press to make this information easy to access, not just for those who can afford a subscription. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I admire the Guardian’s approach — they’re a journalism organization that has chosen not to hide their work behind a paywall. Instead, they ask readers to make either a recurring or one-time donation if they are able. Their strategy points out something important — reporting isn’t free to do, so if you value the work the Guardian does, you ought to contribute to their coffers. It’s also the job of those who can afford it to chip in, since this helps keep information accessible for all. Independent journalism is a valuable, powerful source for information, but it’s useless if would-be readers can’t access it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Local newspapers have a unique role to play in informing communities about who’s on the ballot. Finding information about high-profile U.S. House or Senate races is much easier than learning about the ins and outs of your State Auditor or Secretary of State race. But it’s important to be informed about each race on your ballot — even the ones that seem small in comparison to congressional positions. Sheriffs set local law enforcement priorities, while state Supreme Court judges and Appeals Court judges shape how the law is administered and auditors make sure the state’s books are being run honestly. If information about these state-level races isn’t easy to find, voters are much less likely to make informed choices. I’m a reliable voter, even in off-year elections, but I find the process of researching candidates cumbersome, especially when I have a pile of homework to attend to.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Obviously, the responsibility of being an informed voter doesn’t just lie with newspapers and other sources of information — it also lies with you. Please do your homework about the candidates that are running for office. Please vote. If you already have done both of those things, bother your friends to do them too. And don’t just vote this time — local election turnout in off years is even worse than turnout in midterm elections. The choices that you make can help shape what your community looks like this year and in the years to come. (Personally, the school board elections are my favorite.)</span></p>

		<title>Schmidt &#039;21: TWTP rightfully asks tough questions of students</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/23/schmidt-21-twtp-rightfully-asks-tough-questions-students/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To prepare for the drastic change in social climate between my previous schooling experiences and Brown, I applied to the Third World Transition Program, a four-day pre-orientation program dedicated to talking about systems of oppression and fostering an environment of open discussion. I figured I would like to understand my own identity better and learn about the resources available to me, as well as get a sense of open discussion Brown is known for. The program did its job 10 times over, and then some.</span></p>
<p class="p2">In my high school, you just didn’t discuss issues of race. Even asking what race meant was taboo. As a biracial student, I was lost and straddling two worlds, and the lack of discussion in school provided no assistance. What came from this lack of communication and understanding was microaggressions, those insidiously misguided ideas and beliefs that taint our perceptions. I often recall how, in response to my complaint about a low score on an exam, a former classmate expressed surprise that black people cared about their grades. I cringe at the memory, shocked by how the classmate was genuinely under that impression, but more so by how the culture of my school allowed these thoughts and perceptions to form unaddressed and unquestioned.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown and its TWTP program encouraged me to ask questions relating to my identity for the first time. I was plucked from the sheltered microcosm of my high school and transplanted into a university where discussion of social issues is not only on the table but welcomed and encouraged. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A discussion in TWTP stuck with me as I struggled to come to terms with the phrase “white privilege.” Me? Have white privilege? I can’t have white privilege! I’m black — well, I’m also white. Coming from a background in which I had been the target of microaggressions, I had not considered that I may have been benefiting from similar systems of racial stratification.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These were some of the hard questions TWTP had me confront — and I was horribly unprepared for how uncomfortable being faced with some ugly truths about my identity would be. The TWTP program not only helped me foster discussions about the microaggressions I had faced in years prior, it also made me realize a lot of dark truths, many of which I didn’t want to admit to myself. I too was complicit in the system that had worked against me in high school. Being treated more fairly when not disclosing my race — also known as white-passing — is a privilege I was afforded that other students in the program were not. I just never realized it until that moment, and I detested the thought that I had experienced advantages in life that I hadn’t even recognized until 18 years into it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">I noticed how uncomfortable my peers around me were as they went through the program as well. No one wants to admit they benefit from an unjust system, and even worse, no one wants their fellow students to be harmed by one. But TWTP also reminded us of something I had almost forgotten in my quest to figure out what my racial identity meant to me: Race is only one identity. Through the variety of discussions such as the sexism, classism, heterosexism and ableism workshops, we learned that it’s important to be mindful of microaggressions not only when it comes to race, but also for a multitude of other identities. Brown students come from all walks of life and are shaped by more than just the color of their skin. I walked away from the TWTP workshops knowing race is an essential aspect of identity, yes, but that it is not the whole picture. It’s important to be mindful of what you say regarding other identities too.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As I work toward understanding what race is, I am developing a better understanding of what my own racial identity is, how much it means to me and what other labels I might give myself should I choose to use them. Getting uncomfortable means you are asking the tough questions, the ones that need to be discussed in order to foster productive dialogue and interpersonal relationships with people from a myriad of backgrounds. I don’t think I would be thinking in this context and at this level of understanding if I were at any other school other than Brown. Had I never attended TWTP, I probably would have never thought of these questions in the first place.</span></p>

		<title>Simshauser &#039;20: A virtuous cycle</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">An empty road. No, not empty. A metallic flash of red whirs by, unabated by kinetic friction, gone in an instant. The landscape’s hues begin to desaturate. That is, until another radiant vehicle inevitably zips past. Indeed, the fall semester has ushered in these splendidly vivid, effortlessly quick, electrified JUMP bikes. Fast becoming a fixture of campus life, JUMP bikes are revolutionizing student transportation.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, bicycles have long been used to compress travel times across the rolling inclines of College Hill. But the fixed costs deterred many students from keeping a bicycle on campus. Beyond the financial commitment of purchasing a bike, there is also the responsibility of keeping track of it. From ensuring the bike is locked at all times, maintaining it throughout stormy weather and simply finding a place to keep it, bicycle ownership seems daunting. With the debut of citywide JUMP bikes, however, Brown students can now enjoy the pleasures of riding a bicycle without the steep costs or responsibilities of ownership.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The JUMP bike-share program began in San Francisco in 2017. Nurtured in the entrepreneurial crucible of Silicon Valley, the startup found immediate traction in the Bay Area. It soon expanded to Washington, D.C., before it was bought by Uber in April 2018. JUMP bikes subsequently proliferated into four other cities, including Providence in July, as Uber ambitiously invested in its bike-sharing venture. Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza welcomed the program. “Experiencing all that Providence’s neighborhoods have to offer,” Elorza said in a <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180719/providence-to-launch-bike-share-rentals-in-august--video">statement</a> to the Providence Journal, “is an experience that should not be missed.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Elorza’s belief that bike sharing would facilitate exploration of Providence has been manifest on Brown’s campus this year. The vast majority of students do not own cars, thus constraining any tour of the city to one within walking distance. With JUMP bikes, the city has been effectively compressed, with far more of Providence’s attractions suddenly within reach. Traveling between classes has also been streamlined; the dreaded walks from Barus and Holley to Pembroke campus have been reduced to short jaunts with a JUMP bike.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The advantages of increased bicycle usage reach beyond the scope of transportation. There are material environmental benefits as students and locals alike ditch ride-sharing for bike-sharing programs. The battery-powered JUMP bikes are ecologically friendly on their own; moreover, by increasing the visibility of bicycles in general, they can precipitate a cultural shift toward sustainable transportation methods. Elorza <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180924/with-bicycling-on-roll-in-ri-its-harder-to-keep-riders---especially-children---safe--poll">described</a> a new vision for Providence as the city moves away from cars as the dominant mode of transport: “We made a conscious effort to plan our city around people,” Elorza said to the Journal, “not around cars.” Those who work in public transportation have also been excited by bike-sharing programs; they envision a cooperation between publicly shared bikes and public buses as a replacement for single-use automobile travel. “The JUMP bike service will provide Rhode Islanders with one more way to leave their cars at home,” Rhode Island Public Transit Authority CEO Scott Avedisian said in a <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180719/providence-to-launch-bike-share-rentals-in-august--video">statement</a> to the Journal. Instead of cars, Avedisian hopes more Rhode Islanders “will use a bus-bike combination for their commutes.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And while it is easy to analyze the positive impact of JUMP bikes through tangible metrics (commute time, emission reductions, etc.), the immaterial benefits of biking are equally important. The ubiquity of JUMP bikes allows for impromptu exercise, which has been shown to aid memory and mental health. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/well/move/exercise-brain-memory-fitness-cognitive.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBicycles%20and%20Bicycling">recent study</a> of 36 college students who lightly rode a stationary bike for 10 minutes found that “even light exercise can change people’s brains and minds right away.” The students who rode the bike remembered images more clearly than the control group of students who did not and exhibited calmer heart rates in subsequent hours. As bike-sharing programs grow in popularity around Brown, they increase the physical health of students, and in turn, perhaps their mental well-being. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is all to say: Bring more JUMP bikes to campus. While they already seem omnipresent, there remains room for growth. The finite supply of bicycles can seem restrictive, especially when facing one of Brown’s many uphill walks that veer into calf workouts. The integrated motor of JUMP bikes make them particularly satisfying on inclines. When you climb a hill, you pedal with more force, and the motor funnels in more power to help you reach the summit with ease. A rider in New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/nyregion/are-electric-bikes-about-to-take-over-new-york.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBicycles%20and%2Bicycling">explained</a>, “It doesn’t feel like cheating — it gets the rider to think, ‘Hey, I’m much stronger than I thought.’”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The introduction of JUMP bikes has already been a boon for the Brown community, with the campus becoming more connected internally and the city beyond College Hill growing more accessible. An influx of bikes would only amplify these benefits and further concretize the shift away from cars as the normative form of transportation. As JUMP bikes streamline connections around Brown’s physical campus, so too is the sense of community bolstered.</span></p>

		<title>Flynn &#039;20: An open letter to Sen. Warren before her Brown lecture</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a time of stark polarization, when America is more divided than ever and when the left and the right are unable to find any kind of common ground, both sides of the political divide seem at last to express agreement on one particular matter: It is wrong to exploit racial ancestry to serve a political purpose. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, — who succumbed to President Trump’s puerile mockery by releasing her DNA test to the public in order to prove her Native American ancestry — has taught us this lesson.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The criticism is not, of course, identical on both sides of the political aisle. The left is upset, among other reasons, because she <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/elizabeth-warren-falls-for-trumps-trap-and-promotes-insidious-ideas-about-race-and-dna">conflated</a> small traces of genetic ancestry with inclusion in an ethnic group to which she had no connection other than some family stories. The Cherokee Nation even issued an <a href="https://www.cherokee.org/News/Stories/20181015_Cherokee-Nation-responds-to-Senator-Warrens-DNA-test">official statement</a> explaining to Warren the irrelevance of DNA to tribal citizenship: “Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.” The right is upset, among many other reasons, because she seems to have used her family stories to claim the status as a “Native American” professor at Penn and as the first woman-of-color professor at Harvard Law. But Ross Douthat at the New York Times expresses well the annoyance felt by both sides: “From the identitarian left to the anti-affirmative-action right, I defy you to find a single person invested in these debates who believes that someone who might be one-64th or even one-32nd Indian and whose Cherokee experience consists of old family stories should qualify as a first ‘minority’ hire in anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Furthermore, Warren’s pandering to Trump’s shenanigans serves to degrade political discourse into a farce. Michelle Obama famously proclaimed the proper response to these tactics: “Our motto is, when they go low, we go high.” Warren did not heed this advice. By internalizing and taking seriously Trump’s mockery, Warren descended to his level and legitimized it, with the bonus effect of offending the very people for whom she had claimed to speak. And in spite of — from what I can tell — nearly unanimous disapproval, she is nevertheless <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-dna-test-senator-says-she-wanted-to-help-rebuild-trust-in-government/">doubling down</a> on her DNA test, now saying that she released it for the sake of restoring “trust in government.” More likely, she wants to appear confident and strong against Trump in anticipation of a possible presidential bid in 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A week from now, as it happens, Warren will address the Brown community at the Governor Frank Licht ’38 Lecture. This is a great opportunity for her to speak on the controversy surrounding her decision to release the results of her DNA test and the dubious backing they provide to her claim of Native American ancestry. I, therefore, address this open letter to Warren in anticipation of next Thursday’s lecture:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dear Sen. Warren,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With all due respect, might you just acknowledge your mistake? Everyone else acknowledges it. If the goal of the Democratic party is — as it ought to be — to mend the sorry state of political discourse into which the country has fallen, then the best way of forwarding that goal is to acknowledge that DNA tests play no role in it. Brown itself grapples with issues of diversity. To claim minority status on the basis of some family stories and a few strands of DNA — without a more substantial connection to that group­­ — does not help institutions of higher education that seek to diversify themselves, and it does not help to voice the grievances of underrepresented groups. You have also dignified the rhetorical bafoonery and the ad hominem attacks that characterize Trumpian politics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I, with utmost cordiality, request of you at least to address this controversy. It is your decision whether you should reconsider your position. But if you do stick to your position, as you have thus far done, I do hope that you are doing so on the basis of your principles and not for a political purpose, and that you will discuss those principles with us on Thursday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thank you!</span></p>

		<title>Fernandez &#039;21: Reconsidering capitalism as the only option</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/30/fernandez-21-reconsidering-capitalism-option/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Political Theory Project hosted a Janus Forum called “Urban Policy in the 21st Century” Oct. 25 to discuss the future of economic policy in the United States. The two lecturers, representing a conservative and a liberal perspective on economic policy, discussed the practicality of specific economic measures — such as user-fee systems and investment in education — that might function within the hyper-capitalist framework of the United States and address as-yet unmet social needs.</p>
<p class="p1">As I left the Forum, I was not so much concerned with the specifics of the policies discussed as I was disappointed in the unquestioning acceptance of the underlying capitalist framework of our economic system. Perhaps this was simply not the scope of the Forum, but nevertheless I was prompted to think back to my experience in economics and political science courses and was faced with a similar absence of self-critical questioning. It becomes clear that in the field of U.S. economics there is a consensus that considers capitalism the only viable framework within which advanced society can exist. Even in the dominant discourse of political philosophy in elite institutions across the United States, we presume the infeasibility of alternative economic systems as discussion is centered on their nominal value rather than their practicality. Are these consensuses or presumptions justified, and what are the consequences of holding them if they are not sufficiently so?</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The answer to at least the first part of this question seems to be quite certainly no, for there are functioning alternatives active today. Let us consider the example of Bolivia, which defined itself as a “social economy” in 2009. This serves as a real and current challenge to the rhetoric of capitalism as the only viable option. The social economy is understood to be a third-sector system that bridges the gap between the traditional two-sector public and private in order to most efficiently and fairly meet social needs. The Bolivian “plural (social) economy is made up of Community, State, private and social cooperative forms of economic organization.” In this way, the social economy recognizes both private and public interests and values both efficiency of production and fairness of distribution in ways inaccessible to either modern capitalism or socialism. The Bolivian model of the social economy is centered around the small-scale production of the commercial along with the non-commercial, linked to indigenous and traditional forms of communal organization. These economic measures are not only founded in the values of cohesion and equality, but also in larger political agendas of overcoming the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2017/01/05/as-socialist-venezuela-collapses-socialist-bolivia-thrives-heres-why/?utm_term=.5792f109dd95">legacies of the neoliberal and colonial models</a> that governed until the election of Evo Morales in 2006. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">U.S. theorists cannot even conceptualize the social economy outside of the framework of capitalism. For the American economist, the social entrepreneur is at the center of the U.S. approximation of the social economy. The social entrepreneur is the owner of the nonprofit social enterprise, and is explained by the capitalist framework as having individualistic motivations similar to those of the business entrepreneur, differing only in that social entrepreneurs focus on maximizing social impact rather than maximizing profit. In this way, the U.S. conceptualization of the social economy is still subject to the mechanism of self-interest and is reliant on the exceptionalism of certain individuals. However, in Bolivia, the state’s social or economic mechanisms are not reliant on the individual’s benevolent intentions; these individuals are seen as participants of the private sector. Instead, the responsibility for acting in the public interest lies primarily with state and community actors. In the United States, the social economy is seen not as a genuine alternative to capitalism, but rather as a means to correct the gaps left by the existing market system. As a result, the United States employs many of these means in the forms of social safety nets, for it is distinctly not organized under a purely market driven institution. However, the Bolivian social economy is substantively different, as it is not merely a correcting mechanism, but instead an overarching framework that places profit-seeking interests squarely below community interests. The Bolivian conceptualization understands that there is no space in which the private sector can be allowed to act independently from the community decision making process, and therefore the private sector only acts as one of many means by which the economy works toward collective goals. In this way, the private sector is only one contributing factor that works to achieve sustainability alongside the community, state and social cooperatives that do the bulk of the heavy lifting.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And the Bolivian system of a social economy has had many successes. Bolivia has seen some of the highest GDP growth rates in all of Latin America in the last decade. The country has reduced the levels of moderate poverty from 59 percent to <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bolivia/overview">39 percent</a> and inequality has also fallen significantly. Bolivia was even running budget surpluses from 2006 to 2014, setting its economy up for sustainability. Bolivia’s social economy is unquestionably an organization that is fundamentally different from U.S. capitalism, proving at least the potential for a successful alternative. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">My intention is not to say that the United States should adopt the Bolivian constitution; if economic theorists can agree on anything, it is that the social economy depends on the society it is meant to serve. Instead, I hope to invite the thinkers in this field to imagine, for a moment, an alternative to our forms of economic organization. I’d like to question why we are so quick to accept the presumptions on which we build discussions about economic policy. At the very least, the Bolivian model urges us to include these challenges in theoretical spaces of courses and forums at institutions like Brown. If there is anyone with the privilege of imagining a reality outside of our entrenched capitalist tradition, one we might potentially be more excited to live in, it is participants in these spaces. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As the leaves transform from green to shades of gold and red and the days get noticeably shorter, it’s evident that the seasons are changing. The temperature dropping not only signals the arrival of autumn, but also the arrival of cuffing season. Cuffing season is defined as a period during the fall and winter months when many people find themselves wanting to be in a relationship or “cuffed” with someone. There will be people looking for dating prospects from their classes and their extracurriculars, but plenty of students at Brown will find their matches on dating applications. With dating apps, students have more opportunities to meet people who are more compatible with them, even outside the Brown and Rhode Island School of Design bubble. Unfortunately, students’ usual close-mindedness in looking for partners results in self-segregation and untold missed connections.</p>
<p class="p1">Online dating is becoming more and more <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/10/21/online-dating-relationships/">popular and socially acceptable</a>, especially among young people. Dating apps are mostly infamous for featuring strange people and facilitating<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>hookup culture, but data show that dating apps can create connections between people otherwise separated by race, class, etc. In their paper, “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609091/first-evidence-that-online-dating-is-changing-the-nature-of-society/">The Strength of Absent Ties: Social Integration via Online Dating</a>,” Josue Ortega and Philipp Hergovich investigated how dating apps have impacted interracial marriage within our society. People are <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/10/21/online-dating-relationships/">more likely</a> to date within their group of friends and tend to form friendships with others that live near them; people who occupy the same social positions; and people who share the same attitudes and behaviors. Since friendships and social networks are largely structured by race and ethnicity, interracial couples and marriages still aren’t very common — though they are <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/12/key-facts-about-race-and-marriage-50-years-after-loving-v-virginia/">on the rise</a>. To study how dating apps overcome historical barriers, the researchers designed a social network consisting of men and women from different races. Randomly distributed links between individuals were devised<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to mimic social connections. When the researchers added links between people from different ethnic groups, the number of interracial marriages increased dramatically. The researchers concluded that online dating, with its ability to overcome barriers and make connections, leads to dramatic racial integration.</p>
<p class="p1">As dating apps have the potential to create connections, students at Brown should do more to take advantage of these opportunities. Anecdotally, when students use these dating apps, they often swipe left on, or reject, students who do not attend Brown or RISD. Many of them might say that this is because of proximity or safety reasons, which are fair points. On the other hand, Brown and RISD students should be more open to forming connections with students who do not attend our institutions, since it will increase their chances of building a relationship with someone who is compatible with them, despite external differences.</p>
<p class="p1">Young adults may also harbor a false sense of security when they meet people online based on proximity alone. Professor of Sociology at the University of Houston Pamela Anne Quiroz discovered in her <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0160597613481727">research</a> that the popularity of dating applications stems from the illusion of “thin trust”— defined as the assumption that if an anonymous person appears similar to you and shares your extended social circle, they are trustworthy. Many individuals on these dating applications believe that this “thin trust” can lead to “thick trust” and ultimately a meaningful relationship.</p>
<p class="p1">When Brown students in the Providence area swipe through profiles that say “Brown” or “RISD,” there is a notion of thin trust since they most likely share an extended social circle. This false sense of security can be tricky since it doesn’t necessarily mean a meaningful connection can develop due to surface-level traits. Furthermore, this type of thinking can prevent students from meeting people who attend schools that they aren’t too familiar with, since they do not, at first glance, resemble them.</p>
<p class="p1">This mindset that many Brown and RISD students have about dating also stems from a phenomenon called assortative mating, the tendency for individuals to marry people resembling themselves. Educationally assortative mating rose for decades after World War II — when more people began to attend college and more good jobs were reserved for college graduates — and is still <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/29/upshot/college-marriage-class-differences.html">in play today</a>. Many Brown students look for romantic partners who, like themselves, are planning on entering a well-paid career, have a family financial situation that resembles theirs and attend a high-status college. It’s worth noting that most elite colleges have certain characteristics that are associated with the students: in the case of Brown, being well-rounded, passionate, intelligent, etc. By swiping right on students at Brown and other elite colleges, they, subconciously or not, associate these characteristics — perhaps exclusively — with these people, too.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s important to note that while it’s not bad to want to date someone who resembles you in some ways, educationally assortative mating can be particularly damaging. In the short term, it can limit people to only surrounding themselves with similar perspectives and not being able to grow and be challenged by someone with a different experience. In the long term, educationally assortative mating exacerbates income inequality and social divides. It has been found in studies that through this phenomenon, well-paid college graduates tend to marry each other while poorly paid high school dropouts do the same, which only deepens the gap of income inequality.</p>
<p class="p1">While dating apps can give Brown students more chances to meet different people, educationally assortative mating and the false sense of security based on proximity can restrict students in doing this. These biases that are prevalent on campus may be subconsciously affecting these students. If students are looking for a connection of any commitment level, they should consider two things. First, where are they looking for these connections? And secondly, why are they looking for these connections in these places? Thorough reflection on these questions will help address these biases.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>Editor's Note: Due a technical error, a draft version of this column was posted at 11:34 p.m., Oct. 31, 2018 and appeared in the Nov. 1 print edition. The final version was posted at 9:44 a.m., Nov. 1, 2018. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em>
<p class="p1">The <a href="http://files.constantcontact.com/b73a840a001/00ac65be-3843-4d5f-8d79-098f396329c7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dean of the College recently released a report</a> that synthesized the work of a committee created last semester to review the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs and its three undergraduate concentrations — development studies, international relations and public policy. The report provided a detailed analysis of the structures, curricula, faculty advising and overall “strengths and opportunities” across the three concentrations. The report concluded, somewhat abruptly, that the three concentrations should be merged into a single “global studies” concentration with two tracks — governance, focused on comparative policy, and development, based on the current development studies program.</p>
<p class="p1">To start, this specific committee was comprised of students who graduated with degrees in development studies, public policy and history, according to their respective LinkedIn profiles. No student on the committee graduated with a degree in international relations. At the very least, the study was not conducted with a fair representation of the international relations concentration from the perspective of someone who had completed the requirements. In the class of 2018 alone, there were 62 possible such candidates to join the committee.</p>
<p class="p1">The report specifically criticizes the term international relations for being somewhat outdated, mentioning that several schools, including Yale, the University of Chicago and the University of California, Berkeley, have moved away from “international relations, with its roots in the Cold War-era.” Yes, Watson was founded in 1979, at the height of the Cold War. But it is a naive assertion that interactions between nations were born out of the 1970s ideological battle between the United States and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, why should Brown have to follow the pied piper of its academic peer institutions and consolidate its concentrations when it can chart its own path that caters to the needs of its student body? These other universities do not have the same commitment to an open curriculum, wherein students may tailor their paths to their individual likings. Choice is a hallmark of Brown, mentioned over and over again by administration, faculty and students in admission materials.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike some of its peers, Watson is not an institute lacking funding in its coffers, searching for economic consolidation. UC Berkeley, by contrast, combined development studies and peace and conflict studies into a nebulous “global studies” in order to increase the resources these majors would receive once incorporated into a larger framework — <a href="https://petitions.moveon.org/sign/chancellor-dirks-save" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite student protest</a>. Watson has received a $50 million gift with the express purpose of constructing a new building and hiring new faculty, which proves it is in no way short of money — yet it is the students who will be <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/11/03/watson-institute-receives-50-million-gift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortchanged</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Most importantly, this Watson merger will flatten the nuances of politically and diplomatically relevant areas of study, homogenize an incoming group of students and strip each concentration of its scholastic distinction. The report bemoans the lack of international perspective in the public policy concentration, particularly the fact that the concentration has no language requirement at present. Their proposed remedy: Students would now be required to take the equivalent of six semesters of a language and four regional classes corresponding to the language. (The report includes a throwaway line — “Further discuss language requirement for students focusing on ‘U.S.’ region”— that might limit the regional or language requirements for students looking to focus on U.S. policy. This has not yet been fleshed out, so I will avoid discussing its vague implications for such students.) A facility for language can be helpful in any major, but language learning should not compromise public policy’s focus on the policymaking and implementation process. And what about students who really just want to focus on the nitty-gritty, statelevel of U.S. politics? Will fluency in French or Russian give further insight into Iowa politics? Why would a student policy wonk looking for further insight into the workings of our government at the state or federal legislative level gain depth via 10 mandated courses of, for example, Italian or Italian history?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The addition of a language requirement takes the place of six other classes that could facilitate exploration of other interests. Plus, imagine applying to a job in domestic politics as a self-contradictory<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“global studies concentrator with a focus on the U.S.”</p>
<p class="p1">Development studies remains mainly unchanged in the global studies development track; the report waxes lyrical about the concentration’s distinct atmosphere. This boutique major, usually of 15 concentrators, would most likely receive a new influx of students as a result of the proposal. But with this growth, its spirit may be lost, as the number of new concentrators could disrupt the tightknit community established between students and faculty.</p>
<p class="p1">International relations —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by far the largest concentration of the three — suffers the most from these proposed changes. While the core five classes and language requirements are retained with slight modifications, both tracks of the existing concentration have been folded into the global studies concentration, which focuses on either development studies or public policy. International relations currently offers two tracks — political economy and society and security and society — each of which offer five courses, with many different options available each semester. These broad opportunities will be confined to the margins, and students will have to either focus on development or public policy. Students looking to specialize as international diplomacy and governance experts, or political economy whizzes, will almost completely lose an opportunity for in-depth study in their chosen field. It is almost unfathomable to me that Brown, a school committed to academic exploration and nuance, is considering stripping students of valued and popular options.</p>
<p class="p1">The open curriculum already provides students an opportunity to further their concentration with electives in any department, including language and language-related coursework. As a public policy major, you may take classes in international relations or pick up a new language if you are looking for a global perspective. As an international relations concentrator, you are welcome to take development classes or public policy courses in order to get a better understanding of the ways in which we govern ourselves and the impact governance has on others. By design, the University already affords students these opportunities for exploration, making these mandates unnecessary. Isn’t the purpose of Brown’s open curriculum to enrich student academic options both within and outside a single concentration?</p>
<p class="p1">There are opportunities for increased synergies and cross-pollinization among the Watson concentrations — a major concern of the committee — but stripping them down and mandating only two paths is not the proper solution if the desire is to foster creative scholarship in a field.</p>
<p class="p1">This report should not be treated as gospel. It can be changed, and the leaders of Watson, including Director Edward Steinfeld and Associate Director Steven Bloomfield, have dutifully listened to students in three town hall meetings in order to gauge responses to such a drastic change. This is yet another opinion and suggestion. I respectfully urge the assembled Watson faculty committee to view the concentration consolidation suggestion from the Dean of the College report as a tarnish on the Brown open curriculum model. Doing otherwise would strip nuance from three popular and distinct concentrations and severely limit students who came to Brown specifically to find their own niche. While there is room for improvement within all three concentrations, this does not mean Watson should melt down their essences and sculpt Frankenstein’s monster with bits and pieces from each. Watson has the funds to continue to grow all three concentrations while leaving them substantively intact and recognizing their distinct purposes on campus. Brown should be creating more opportunities for students to craft their concentrations and chart their own paths rather than leaving them with fewer options to pursue their goals. It is the quintessence of what makes Brown the Brown to which we came.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">In <span class="s1">an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/19/kent-daggett-19-city-prioritize-low-income-residents/">Oct. 19 op-ed</a>, Colin Kent-Daggett ’19 made a simplistic and misguided argument against Edge College Hill II — the new luxury student housing development on Canal Street — in a rebuttal to my column published earlier that week. I have to thank Kent-Daggett for his harsh and highly personal criticism, as it encouraged me to re-examine my argument from a new perspective and reformulate some of the points I had originally made. However, that is the extent of the praise I can offer Kent-Daggett. His analysis doesn’t “dredge much deeper” than a cursory review of slum clearance, a not-so-slick-math comparison of median household incomes and a simple claim that I am part of a “much larger problem.” I was, and still am, highly cognizant of these issues, yet their existence alone does not justify the total shutdown of all real estate development other than affordable housing. Building on the points I made in my Oct. 15 column, I believe Providence i</span>s still justified in granting the $19 million property tax relief to student housing (a relevant public issue), but going forward, the City should set up a direct funding program to local public housing authorities and should reduce the amount of tax relief it grants to future developments.</p>
<p class="p3">First, the warped framework connecting federal and local government institutions to the lives of low-income Providence residents has created a system of perverse incentives that allows the City to grant tax breaks with little consequence. Kent-Daggett did not mention this, but the City of Providence <a href="https://data.providenceri.gov/Finance/Budgeted-Expense-Explorer/f85c-gn8t">does not directly fund or subsidize low-income housing</a> out of its own budget.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, it <a href="http://www.providenceri.gov/planning/community-development/">repurposes federal money</a>, usually allocated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through programs like the Community Development Block Grant system or the Home Investment Partnership Program for affordable housing development. There are also local public housing authorities, such as Rhode Island Housing, that sponsor public housing projects; these entities are “self-sustaining” and usually generate their own operating income without state funding. This means that Providence can approve tax breaks that bolster city coffers and precipitate gentrification without compensating Rhode Island Housing and the Providence Community Development Department, who are then left to grapple with the inequitable side-effects of said tax breaks. The system, as it stands, encourages the City to hand out tax reduction frivolously — a practice that started with Providence Place Mall’s payment-in-lieu-of-taxes program and has more recently made possible a potential $18.5 million public subsidy to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/16/n-y-developer-proposes-constructing-tallest-building-providence/">Hope Point Tower</a>. To address this miscalibration of incentives, I believe the City should voluntarily carve out a portion of its annual budget toward financing affordable housing in Providence, so that it is forced to exercise a level of discipline when deciding on tax agreements.</p>
<p class="p3">Second, I think that the City should gradually ramp down its well-established policy of granting tax stabilization agreements over time, as it is ultimately not the role of the City to make the financing of projects easier for developers. The city has granted 69 tax breaks to development projects since 1996, according to <a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/dan-mcgowan/report-calls-providence-tax-breaks-a-powerful-economic-development-tool/1082457031">WPRI</a>. That is ludicrous — equivalent to at least three tax breaks a year. These tax breaks artificially boost a development’s financials to achieve a market-rate return on cost, essentially the financial hurdle that determines whether a project is constructed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Many developers (cough, cough, Jason Fane) play a game of chicken with the City, complaining about <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170721/study-substantial-subsidy-probably-needed-for-proposed-providence-high-rise">low return on cost and project feasibility</a> until the City caves with a tax agreement. The City needs to realize that this practice is self-reinforcing and that if it is serious about saving money, it needs to be okay letting developers walk away from a few projects. So what if Fane doesn’t like the risk-return profile of Hope Point Tower without a tax break? The real estate market will find someone else who does. It ultimately is not up to the City to step in and make Fane’s life easier. The same should follow for any real estate developer in Providence.</p>
<p class="p3">That being said, I believe student housing projects, because they address an urgent public need, unlike most other development projects, deserve a tax agreement. The fact that the average Brown student household income is significantly higher than the average Providence household income does not immediately subordinate student problems to low-income problems in some sort of hierarchy. I don’t see the point in creating a totem pole of whose problems are more important; this does not need to be zero-sum game. Student housing is a major issue in Providence. Student-rented houses on the East Side are usually overcrowded with students, usually stuffed in converted-attic units that often do not comply with zoning or fire code occupancy standards. Many of these houses also present a nuisance to long-time neighbors because of noise complaints. This is a problem, not only for students, but for East Side residents. Edge College Hill II would introduce competitive new supply into a supply-starved market — there is clearly more to be gained than lost on a tax agreement.</p>
<p class="p3">Yes, slum clearance happened in Providence. Yes, Brown students are wealthier than most residents of Providence. The City’s decision to grant Edge College Hill II a tax break is still justified. There are some things the City needs to change about its current approach toward development.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Over my first three years at Brown, semester after semester, the times I’ve felt the best were always when I was the busiest. I packed my schedule with activity after activity, and my days would take on a rhythm to which I’m sure many of you can relate: wake up at 8 a.m. and shower, maybe get breakfast before you run out the door. Head to class, then finish some last-minute work in a coffee shop before you head back to class. Eat lunch while doing work in a library, then head to a few meetings, work at Jo’s and go back to the library. If you finish everything on time, head back home at 2 a.m. and fall asleep, ready to do the same the next day. With so much on my plate, I barely had time to scroll through Facebook, let alone be introspective in any healthy capacity. But despite my best efforts to mindlessly go about my day-to-day, I’ve come to an epiphany. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While I was grumpily washing dishes, thinking that I was at least learning a good skill for real life, I experienced the bizarre sensation of discovering that the way I envisioned my life didn’t align with the way I was actually living it. All of a sudden I realized: As a college student, I’m not preparing for my “real life.” I’m living it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If there’s one thing Brown students do well, it’s committing to the grind. (If you don’t believe me, go to the SciLi basement pretty much any weeknight during midterms and again in the morning, and count the number of people who are still there). It’s incredibly easy to become a workaholic here — everywhere you turn, there are people you can look up to who seem to be juggling 10 leadership positions, sleep and a thriving social life with ease. Of course that’s not really true of anyone, but it contributes to a culture of feeling like you should always be doing more. Fortunately, enough people sustain this illusion that we’ve developed something of a support network, and people feeling totally overburdened by their work often have a variety of resources that can serve as a lifeline. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When it comes to just getting by, I’m often my own worst enemy. For better or worse, life as a Brown student can be unbelievably busy, but for a long time, I honestly preferred it that way. Don’t get me wrong, I hate the frequent feeling that I’m running on a log in water, just one misstep away from flying off in spectacular fashion. But it was actually those times when my routine afforded me some free time that I began to compare myself to my friends here and to think that I wasn’t doing enough to succeed. (Friends: You are amazing, I love you, but please for the love of God stop being so good at everything). So I kept myself busy, and tried desperately to find a way to love the things I thought I was supposed to be doing. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That constant frenetic pace of life is so common here that I never really questioned it, but it’s also 100 percent responsible for the fact that I somehow never stepped back enough to realize that I need to make the most of the present. This is what we get. It’s not like this is an extraordinary or even original idea, but it is one that I thought I knew and at least in some way lived by. Unfortunately, by and large, I haven’t — that much has been made clear by the changes I’ve had to make while trying to remedy the dissonance. I’ve given up resume-building positions for the chance to just sit and write, and I’ve committed myself to spending more time with my friends and pursuing things I enjoy at the (unfortunately) intentional expense of my grades. And while I’m still far from having a great or easy time, I find myself with two things I previously didn’t think could coexist: free time and contentment with my semester. It’s just a shame it took me so long to get here. </span></p>

		<title>Simshauser ’20: The fantasy of voter fraud, the reality of voter suppression</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When polls for the midterm elections close tomorrow, the significance of the results will be placed within the parameters of national politics. “Will the House accelerate the Russia investigations?” “Has the Republican hold on the Senate come to an end?” “Can Democrats halt the Trump agenda?” These are, of course, vital issues. But fixing the scope of coverage to the national level restricts the importance of statewide elections to the states themselves, failing to capture the broader implications of local races. In the Kansas gubernatorial race, between Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach and Democratic State Sen. Laura Kelly, the electoral consequences extend far beyond the state’s budget or control of the redistricting process in 2020. If Kobach, for whom FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/kansas/">currently projects</a> a 59 percent chance of winning, takes home the governorship, the most basic right — the ability to vote in elections — will be at risk in Kansas. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Kobach’s political career began in 1999, when he won a seat on the city council of Overland Park, Kansas. He burnished his conservative reputation from there; as chairman of the Kansas GOP between 2007 and 2009, he instituted a “loyalty committee” to punish Republican candidates that had the nerve to assist Democratic candidates in any capacity. He captured public attention with fiery rhetoric in speeches, such as when he compared Planned Parenthood to the infamous Nazi doctor <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article36718005.html">Josef Mengele</a>. And he hosted a conservative talk radio show until January 2016, introducing himself <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/magazine/the-man-behind-trumps-voter-fraud-obsession.html">before each broadcast</a> as the “the A.C.L.U.’s worst nightmare.”</p>
<p class="p2">But above all, Kobach is an immigration hawk, with fearful and racially-motivated views of widespread voter fraud that inform his extremely restrictive voting laws. As secretary of state, Kobach implemented a proof-of-citizenship law in 2013 that drew immediate scrutiny from civil liberties groups. This new requirement applied only to voters registering after 2013, a population that is far younger and more ethnically diverse than Kansas as a whole — and almost certainly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates. The ACLU <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/magazine/the-man-behind-trumps-voter-fraud-obsession.html">attested</a> that the new law prevented “tens of thousands of Kansans from registering to vote” — one in seven new registrants.</p>
<p class="p2">While Kobach views these laws as a necessary countermeasure to pervasive voter fraud, organizations like the ACLU argue that the law’s true purpose is to halt demographic shifts in the electorate by suppressing the vote of young people and people of color. Indeed, voter ID laws that make it harder for new voters to register favor the status quo; in Kansas, that means Republican control in every branch of government.</p>
<p class="p2">However, Kobach’s restrictive voter laws are not merely born out of a motivation to preserve partisan influence. His obsession with voter fraud is indelibly linked to maintaining a white electoral majority. In 2014, Kobach <a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article4047969.html">agreed with a caller</a> to his radio show that a further increase in immigration from countries in Central America would result in the “ethnic cleansing” of white Americans. Under Kobach, the only polling center in majority-Hispanic Dodge City <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/us/dodge-city-kansas-voting.html?module=inline">was moved</a> outside of city limits. And he was an early supporter of President Trump, fixated by the president’s hardline stance against immigration. When Trump asserted — with zero evidence — that he would have won the popular vote, “if (not for) the millions of people who voted illegally,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Kobach was there to agree</a>. “I think the president-elect is absolutely correct,” Kobach <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article117957143.html">trumpeted</a>, “when he says the number of illegal votes cast exceeds the popular-vote margin.”</p>
<p class="p2">In August, with an endorsement from Trump, Kobach won a primary challenge against incumbent Jeff Colyer, running from the right of the sitting governor. In a race that saw over 300,000 votes cast, Kobach won by the narrowest of margins —<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/kansas-governor-primary-election"> just 110 votes</a>. On the campaign trail, Kobach has made voting rights a platform issue — he maintains that he wants Kansas’ proof-of-citizenship law to become a “model for the country.” As governor, Kobach would surely continue the expansion of voter ID laws that has characterized his tenure as secretary of state, thus bolstering the Republican hold on the already-conservative state.</p>
<p class="p2">Luckily — at least for those who favor basic civil rights — Kobach’s opponent has garnered substantial support from both parties. Laura Kelly, the assistant minority leader in the Kansas Senate, has run a pragmatic campaign against her ideologue opponent. In a state that Trump won by 20 percentage points, and in which Republicans currently hold a 32-8 seat advantage in the state senate, Kelly does not affix her campaign to common tenets of national Democrats. Instead, she focuses on Kobach’s support of tax cuts under former Gov. Sam Brownback, which devastated the state’s budget to the tune of a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/10/25/560040131/as-trump-proposes-tax-cuts-kansas-deals-with-aftermath-of-experiment">$600 million deficit</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Her rhetoric similarly paints her as a nonpartisan public worker. “Kansans are a lot like me,” she says. “They’re common-sense, they’re very pragmatic and they’re extraordinarily <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/10/kobach-trump-democrats-kansas-governor-race/572428/">moderate</a>.” Rather than lambaste Kobach for his draconian voting reforms, she expends her political energy on finding ways to fund education and health care in the wake of enormous mismanagement. Her strategy has worked; former Republican Gov. Bill Graves came out in support of Kelly, and 40 percent of Republicans in the state legislature <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/09/kris-kobach-resistance-from-kansas-republicans-spreads.html">refused to respond</a> when asked whether they support Kobach.</p>
<p class="p2">And while the Sunflower State has a generations-long tradition of supporting Republican candidates in national politics — they have not elected a Democratic senator since 1930 — their gubernatorial preferences are far more cyclical. Three of the last six governors have been Democrats, and the most recent polling in Kansas has Kelly ahead by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/kansas/">two points</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">In an electoral cycle that has seen attempted voter suppression by multiple GOP candidates across the nation, the results in Kansas will portend the fate of voting rights at large. Kobach wants the power to create “the absolute best legal framework” for sweeping voter ID laws, hoping to set a precedent for the rest of the country to follow. In Georgia, Secretary of State and Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp has preemptively begun investigating the Georgia Democratic Party for voter fraud, setting the stage for a flood of restrictive laws <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/us/politics/georgia-elections-kemp-voters-hack.html">should he win</a>. And in North Dakota, the state’s Supreme Court recently upheld a new ID law that prevented 70,000 people from voting in 2012. Indeed, in Kansas and in states throughout the country, the right to vote is on Tuesday’s ballot.</p>

		<title>Aman &#039;20: It’s time to rethink the wage gap</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I had 80 cents for every time I saw an infographic with a drawing of a partial dollar bill proclaiming, “Women earn 80 cents for every dollar a man makes!” I would be decently rich. And if I earned a dollar for every time I saw a snarky comment on Facebook arguing that “the wage gap is a myth” because women work fewer hours and choose lower-paying professions, I’d have at least a thousand dollars. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Arguing over this statistic is missing the point, though; we’re stuck in an endless debate over the existence of a wage gap without considering the true root causes or finding solutions. In order to have a productive debate about wage inequality, it’s time we move past the “cents for every dollar” statistics and toward more nuanced explanations and descriptions of gender-based pay disparity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To clarify, these “cents on the dollar” statistics are average full-time year-round wages for men and women. And yes, it is true, much of the gap between men and women (without accounting for race) can be explained by factors such as occupation and position within a given company. For example, when <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2017/10/07/the-gender-pay-gap">researchers</a> looked at employees doing the same job for the same employer in 25 developed countries, factors other than gender explained most of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the wage gap. (That is, controlling for a variety of attributes such as occupation and experience, women earn 98 cents for every dollar men earn.) In the United States, according to research conducted by Glassdoor, women earn 94.6 cents for every dollar earned by men. While getting paid less to do the exact same work is blatantly unfair, this outright discrimination in pay for men and women in similar positions accounts for only a small portion of wage disparities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The purpose of wage gap statistics is to bring attention to the problem of wage disparities in a concise way, but using the wage gap as proof of inequality is problematic. Firstly, as I’ve established, these statistics are misleading; without context, they imply that women are paid significantly less than men to perform the same jobs. Even when political actors use misleading statistics, or even flat-out lies, we should hold ourselves to a higher standard. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Secondly, and more importantly, focusing on the wage gap leads us only to partial solutions, as statistics like “women earn 80 cents for every dollar men make” suggest that forcing employers to pay women equally will solve gender wage inequality. In the United States, many have focused on legislative fixes, such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibits unequal pay for equal work based on sex, and the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/the-current-state-of-equal-pay-laws.aspx">Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009</a>, which extends the amount of time women have to file a complaint. Furthermore, some legislators have pushed for the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would add procedural protections to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (though it has failed to pass Congress three times, most recently in 2014). Some states and municipalities have begun to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/places-where-salary-question-banned-us-2017-10">prohibit employers</a> from asking potential employees about previous pay, as this may reinforce past inequalities. These legislative fixes, aimed to ensure equal pay for equal work, are important, but only address a small portion of wage inequality.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rather than only focusing on equal pay for equal work, it’s time to address the unexplained portion of the wage gap. Why don’t men and women do the same types of jobs, and why are male-dominated jobs higher-paying than female-dominated jobs? Why are women less likely to be promoted? These questions are more complicated and much harder to address, but are essential to solving gendered wage inequalities. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The largest factor is likely occupation: One study by Cornell researchers attributed 51 percent of the wage gap to occupational pay differences. Occupations dominated by women tend to have lower status and pay. For example, primary school teachers in high-income countries earn <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2017/10/07/the-gender-pay-gap">81 percent</a> of the average salary for jobs requiring a college degree. Moreover, when men enter occupations previously dominated by women, like computer programming, wages rise, but when women enter fields dominated by men, like biology, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html">wages tend to fall</a>. Childcare is also a large factor, as women are more likely to do the lion’s share of child-rearing and the opportunity for a critical first promotion often coincides with the time at which families begin to have children. <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2017/10/07/the-gender-pay-gap">Data from Britain and the United States</a> show that in both countries, women’s pay falls behind men’s at the age when women typically have their first child.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Going forward, policymakers must go beyond legislation focused simply on equal pay and enact laws that help women overcome systemic obstacles as they seek fair pay. But when we attempt to communicate gender inequality in terms of cents on the dollar, all this nuance is lost. Gender inequality is real and we must find more nuanced and productive ways to talk about inequality to move toward the most effective solutions.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">College dining halls don’t often make the news. However, as this semester commenced, a nickname controversy catapulted the Sharpe Refectory into the headlines. Should it be the Ratty? (Sure.) The Rodent? (I will not entertain this.) The Sharpe Refectory? (Preach!) The outpouring of feeling and meme-ery generated by this debate indicated that Brown students care about their biggest eating establishment.</p>
<p class="p3">Soon, though, debate died down, and the name of the Ratty faded from the spotlight. Though it’s good we’ve moved past debating a name, we shouldn’t take the Ratty for granted, underappreciating its crucial role on campus. The Ratty is a beacon of consistency, a foil to self-importance and an integral part of a healthy campus life. It deserves our recognition and respect.</p>
<p class="p3">There’s a wide range of opinions about the actual food from the Ratty. I, for one, am a loyal devotee. Cajun pasta, sauteed broccoli and lentil soup are all worth the price of admission. (And cream cheese brownies. Mmmm. I once had five in one sitting, and still wasn’t sated.) But regardless of where on the Ratty food appreciation spectrum you fall, we should all agree on one thing: The Ratty is remarkably consistent. Three meals a day, seven days a week, the Ratty is churning out copious amounts of food to feed all sorts of palates and diets. Its dependability is a breath of fresh air. While it might not have any Michelin stars, it humbly and readily takes on the necessary but unsexy task of putting food on the table.</p>
<p class="p3">The Ratty’s institutional humility contrasts with the attitudes of the students who patronize it. Students at Brown — myself very much included — have a reputation for self-importance, with attending an Ivy League university and presumably having been the best at everything since being the first kid in their neighborhood to recite the alphabet backwards. What better antidote to that alluring self-importance than regularly eating at an establishment whose nickname is endearingly self-deprecating.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I don’t know about you, but it’s hard for me to sustain a view of myself as a future member of the secret global leadership cabal while circling the Ratty’s tables in vain for a friend to sit with at a dining hall explicitly evocative of a rodent. More seriously, dining at the Ratty can remind us that no matter who you are or what you do, everyone’s gotta eat, and we are incredibly privileged to have the Ratty there to provide for us. Taking the time to appreciate Ratty meals as valuable parts of the day, not just as pit stops between more “important” endeavors is an elixir to elitism, a puncturer of the pretension of the college bubble. Reflecting on the Ratty’s symbolic role can make us more thoughtful, appreciative people. But the Ratty’s most important role is its practical one that I’ve only passingly mentioned: feeding the population of Brown University. Possibly never again in our lives will we have such abundant and diverse food available to us at a moment’s notice, without even having to turn on a stove. Producing food is incredibly hard work, and the cooks at the Ratty put in an enormous amount of behind-the-scenes labor that is too easily taken for granted. For instance, up until now Ratty employees have endured the summer months with no central air. Thankfully, the administration has promised to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/16/ratty-receive-c-summer-2019/">install air conditioning into the Ratty by summer 2019</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p3">And the Ratty does more than just serve any kind of food. It provides a dazzling array of healthy choices, with vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins abounding. Of course, it also serves its fair share of unhealthy options, (hello again, cream cheese brownies), but ultimately how nutritiously you eat is your choice. You might want to grumble that you had steamed snow peas the last two weeks, but try cooking for yourself every day and see how long you go before a bowl of cereal and days-old leftovers feel like a gourmet dinner. Having such reliable access to nutritious meals is a situation we would do well to appreciate before it’s gone. Just imagine explaining to someone elsewhere in the world that Brown provides its students with functionally unlimited access to food, and you’ll begin to see how unique and incredible the Ratty is.</p>
<p class="p3">Yet instead of taking time to appreciate the Ratty, we are quick to belittle or poke fun at it. When I go on my Aidan-loves-Ratty-broccoli rants, I often get blank stares. And even in the course of writing this column, I had to edit out some of my unnecessarily harsh jabs at Ratty food that overlooked the labor of the talented people who work there. Perhaps because we feel too important for dining hall food or are too caught up in our own daily pursuits, the Ratty just becomes another part of our college lives that we take for granted.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Still, no matter what insults we unthinkingly throw at the Ratty, it doesn’t let that criticism get in the way of its mission. You can complain all you want about the lack of potatoes au gratin on the Sunday brunch menu, but the Ratty isn’t going to let our unreasonable expectations keep it from serving up perfectly good food. You may laugh at a dining hall that calls itself<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The Ratty,” but it’s self-confident enough to withstand mockeries of its moniker. You may want to drop off meal plan altogether, but the Ratty will be there for you to crawl back to when you tire of instant ramen and Baja’s takeout. No matter what barbs you throw at it, the Ratty will still be there, ready and willing to serve you fresh, thoughtfully-prepared food.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The practice of “cancelling” is becoming increasingly common. By cancelling, I mean the process by which people mark someone as problematic and withdraw any and all prior support to ignore and exclude this person. To a lesser degree, when I talk about “cancel culture” I’m also referring to the broader habit our society has of simply doing away with those it finds undesirable. One way this manifests is when celebrities’ old, problematic tweets resurface and people decide to cancel them in retaliation. It is important to remember that actions do have consequences, and folks absolutely should be held accountable for disrespectful or mean-spirited behavior. However, we should also think about what it means for us to immediately close someone off. I believe it’s worth thinking about what accountability looks like beyond simply exiling someone. In doing so, we can position ourselves more firmly within the values of social justice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">One reason worth giving cancel culture a hard examination is that it doesn’t seem to be working. If cancel culture is meant to be a tool for social justice, cancelling people and not paying them any mind would compel them look at their actions and take the time to understand why what they’ve done or said might not be in good taste. While the idea of cancelling someone might be well-intentioned and intended to inspire some introspection and critical thought on the part of the individual being cancelled, rarely does this learning manifest on its own. For example, this past summer Roseanne Barr had the reboot of her show cancelled by ABC following a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/roseanne-barr-tearfully-apologizes-racist-tweet-ive-made/story?id=56126034">racist tweet</a> she made about Valerie Jarrett, a former adviser to former president Barack Obama. As a result, Barr was forced to apologize in hopes of reacquiring a spot in the public’s good graces. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">However, in her apologies to Jarrett, it was clear that Barr had not really grasped an understanding of why she had warranted criticism. Further, her apology doesn’t show her raising her critical consciousness or being more mindful with her language. In other words, nowhere in her apology did Barr say that this fiasco prompted a change in her politics, a hard look in the mirror, an interrogation of the ways in which she perpetuated racism or a lifelong commitment to unlearning racial privilege on her part. This is not to question the validity of Barr’s facing consequences for her actions. Rather, I’m arguing that effectively shutting Barr out might provide an immediate band-aid solution to the problem, but it also provides no real impetus for Barr to critically examine and think about why, exactly, her tweet was problematic, why she was criticized and why her show was cancelled.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Recognizing that cancel culture is not resulting in the learning and changed behavior of cancelled individuals is precisely why I propose a shift in how we deal with people who have said or done irresponsible things. Thinking through what it means to hold people accountable is more in line with the social justice ideals that cancel culture is — at its most basic level — rooted in. That cancel culture may simply be brushing aside those individuals who don’t fit into a collective vision of the future is troubling, and may actually be serving as a direct antithesis to the mission of social justice at the end of the day. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">I’ll try to flesh this out more. In some ways, cancel culture is exemplified by our prison system. We send people away to prison after they’ve committed a crime. It is somewhat implied that the time individuals spend in prison will turn them into good citizens, the kinds of people who don’t commit crimes. Yet, over a nine-year time period, <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=6266">released prisoners averaged five arrests</a>. Like cancel culture, the prison system punishes people, but doesn’t really provide space for behavioral change. What’s more is that the prison population is <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2018.html">disproportionately representative</a> of the black and Latinx population in the United States. Obviously there’s absolutely no moral equivalence between mass incarceration and the efforts by social justice activists to cancel those responsible for bigoted behaviors or statements, and it’s important to recognize that there’s a power disparity between the actors in these situations. But for those of us who seek to uphold social justice ideals, it behooves us to think about what it means for one of the mechanisms we access in the name of social justice — cancelling — to so closely resemble a system that produces negative life outcomes disproportionately for people of color.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Engaging in this thought process and envisioning accountability beyond models evocative of oppressive structures are worthwhile exercises if we seek to live out social justice ideals and frameworks. This is not to say that accountability can’t, in part, look like cancelling. Sometimes, people commit crimes and engage in behavior so harmful and so galling that they don’t deserve a second chance — especially to keep the people around them safe from further harm. But for those who’ve behaved in ways that can be reasonably unlearned, I believe it’s also worth thinking about accountability in terms of restorative justice. In totality, accountability might look like going further than punitive measures to ensure that individuals take active steps to understand the harm they may have perpetuated and develop ways to lead a life in which they’ve given up harmful notions and tendencies. To do this would be to truly commit ourselves to a socially just society.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the midst of countless Brown students eagerly mailing their absentee ballots to their home states, the energy surrounding the midterm elections these past few weeks has been palpable. Indeed, this election cycle was distinctive. Since June 2015, when President Trump first announced his presidential campaign, his careless conduct and demagogic rhetoric have fueled political resistance among a number of groups, including but not limited to Latinx immigrants, Native Americans and women. As the idea of “President Trump” became more and more realistic over the course of the 2016 campaign, many were shocked and appalled that a celebrity-turned-politician whose inflammatory statements constantly made headlines could stand a legitimate chance in the race. With a unified Republican Congress, Trump has continued to incite progressives to actively resist his administration following the shocking 2016 election. In just the last month, Trump has threatened the protection of civil rights for transgender Americans, proposed the end of birthright citizenship and succeeded in confirming Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. On Election Day, those of us who have vehemently opposed the administration finally had an opportunity to channel our dissatisfaction by tangibly changing the composition of Congress.</p>
<p class="p2">Many get-out-the-vote movements during this election cycle have targeted young people, a demographic which generally tends to possess liberal ideals and could therefore make a major contribution to changing Congress. We have seen movements to increase voter turnout both nationwide and locally on Brown’s campus. A number of celebrities, like Taylor Swift, Travis Scott, Yara Shahidi, Meryl Streep, Oprah Winfrey and Brown alum Tracee Ellis Ross ’94 have stepped onto the political scene to encourage more eligible voters to get to the polls on Nov. 6. On campus, the student group ThoughtsPrayersAction<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and the Brown Progressive Action Committee hosted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/547456222748330/">phone-banking event</a> last Monday to support black gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams, Ben Jealous and Mayor Andrew Gillum. ThoughtsPrayersAction also hosted an event titled “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/255043891861748/">Enough is Enough: Why I’m Voting</a>”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>where participants shared the reasons why they would be voting in this midterm election and made posters sharing their messages.</p>
<p class="p2">Exercising the right to vote is fundamental to the proper functioning of our democracy, which is why these efforts to inspire higher turnout are absolutely necessary. According to an analysis by the Atlantic, the number of early voters ages 18 to 29 rose 188 percent in this year’s midterms compared to the 2014 midterms. However, while I, too, am grateful for the “blue wave” into the House of Representatives, I am also frustrated by the reactive nature of our outpouring of political enthusiasm. Following the presidential election in 2008, census data showed an increase in youth voter turnout, possibly as a repercussion of the overwhelmingly low approval rating of former President George W. Bush which reinforced the push to elect a Democrat. In 2012, however, just 38 percent of 18 to 24 year-olds voted in the presidential election. Furthermore, data from The Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement show that a record low of just 20 percent of 18 to 29 year olds voted in the 2014 midterm election, which is perhaps a consequence of feeling insulated from adversity by a Democratic president. In 2016, Hillary Clinton suffered defeat partly because people of color and young people were not galvanized to vote in the same way that they were in the case of former president Barack Obama. It is clear that the youth population had been disengaged from the political process until recently. Today’s movement to be more involved reveals one step of a vicious cycle in which young people neglect to vote, government officials <span class="s1">are elected who do not reflect their preferences and these same politicians consequently enact either unfavorable policies or none at all. We then unite in protest against a callous government until we manage to elect candidates whose views align with ours. Finally, we settle into a false sense of security, once again disengaged from political process, and the cycle repeats. </span></p>
<p class="p2">On Tuesday night, Democrats celebrated achieving a majority in the House of Representatives. However, given the widened Republican majority in the Senate, perhaps young people will continue to stay engaged until a blue wave takes this half of Congress. Nevertheless, our motivation to pay attention to politics should not be contingent on unseating our opponents. If we college students truly want our voices to be heard, it is not enough to merely resist only once things spiral out of control. If we rally together to advocate for our ideals only when they face an explicit threat, it is already too late. No matter who is in power, we must take proactive rather than reactive measures toward ensuring that our preferences are acted upon. What will we do now that we have succeeded in electing a Democratic majority to the House of Representatives? Looking to the future, how will we act if a progressive candidate replaces Trump in 2020? Either we submit to comfort and complacency or continue to be vigilant. The choice is ours.</p>

		<title>Cardoso &#039;19: Don’t let the discussion of legacy admission die</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In a recent community-wide email, Undergraduate Council of Students’ President Shanzé Tahir ’19 announced the creation of a University working group to “critically assess the ways in which Brown admissions can decrease barriers for first-gen and low-income students.” According to the email, the decision to form the working group was, at least in part, a response to the #FullDisclosure campaign, which, as The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/14/students-scrutinize-legacy-based-admission/?fbclid=IwAR08ju5FlXc0yKYgVcN0bMB5-0JcQwpCTPTYkdnu725H1CySK7H6Tx1jC8E">previously reported</a>, scrutinized the University’s legacy admission policies and pushed for greater transparency in how these policies function. But while all efforts to facilitate the conversation on accessibility and diversity in admission are welcome, we as a community must continue to press the University to move beyond its discriminatory practice of giving preference to legacy students. The University’s commitment to (and growing success in) expanding access for low-income and first-generation applicants and creating a more diverse class is laudable; but if it truly hopes to craft an admission policy that prioritizes equal access for underrepresented groups, it must begin working toward the abolition of legacy admission altogether. Any working group that seeks to address the concerns of the #FullDisclosure campaign must make explicit its commitment to investigating the use of legacy status and must not let the conversation on legacy admission get lost in the broader discourse.</p>
<p class="p2">There is a temptation to de-emphasize discussions of legacy admission in favor of some broader conversation about access, but any justification ultimately falls short. First, there is the claim that legacy status is only used as a tie-breaker among equally talented applicants, and therefore is of marginal importance in increasing access for low-income and first-generation students. This tie-breaker policy is justified by its proponents who believe that legacy students contribute to campus life in ways that other students do not. Some may also raise the point that we do not automatically become more socioeconomically diverse simply by abolishing legacy admission, and that this fixation on legacy status is disproportionate. When one digs deeper, neither of these arguments offers a compelling justification for sidelining the legacy debate. No matter how one slices it, abolishing legacy admission is a necessary condition for cultivating genuine socioeconomic diversity in the student body.</p>
<p class="p2">The most common refrain <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/05/powell-dispelling-legacy-myths-help-focus-access/">offered by the University</a> in defense of its legacy admission policy is that it reserves consideration of legacy status for breaking ties between otherwise equally qualified applicants. This is unlikely. As I’ve previously written, legacy status at elite universities actually carries with it significant additional advantages. According to one <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204653604577249230164868846?ns=prod/accounts-wsj&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj">Princeton study</a>, legacy status was equal to an additional 160 points on the SAT. Another <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/04/07/why-do-colleges-still-give-preference-to-children-of-alumni/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9385a1f7edec">similar study</a> in 2011 of approximately 30 top-ranking universities in the United States found that legacy status at the time increased an applicant’s chances of admission by 45 percent. Unless Brown is exceptional in its approach toward legacy applicants, it is, at the end of the day, creating space for legacy students at the expense of low-income and first-generation students because there are only a finite number of spaces. Trying to disentangle the University’s legacy admission policy from the broader discussion of equal access in admissions is impossible, and the University working group should resist this urge.</p>
<p class="p2">Yet even if one assumes that legacy status serves purely as a tie-breaker, there is still no clear reason why legacy applicants should be prioritized at all in the first place. Perhaps the most pervasive (but least compelling) defense offered by the University is that legacy applicants are capable of contributing exceptionally to the Brown community on account of their connection to the school. In his <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/05/powell-dispelling-legacy-myths-help-focus-access/">op-ed</a> to The Herald last March, Dean of Admission Logan Powell wrote that “Many (legacy applicants) grew up immersed in the values of Brown” and could therefore serve as “mentors and guides to other students in navigating the University.” While this argument appears plausible on paper, one can never seem to pinpoint exactly how it operates in the real world. Are we expected to believe that alums put special effort into inculcating their children with “Brown values”? Do parents teach their children about the Ratty and the Open Curriculum? And should we accept the implication that through some transgenerational process of cultural osmosis, the children of alums are naturally more capable of acting as leaders and mentors? Is there empirical evidence to substantiate this argument, or are we meant to take this glib explanation at face value? The deeper one digs, the less this argument seems like a sincere defense of legacy admission and the more it seems like a pretext for maintaining the practice after the fact.</p>
<p class="p2">But regardless of whether the University is theoretically capable of simultaneously maintaining legacy admission and engaging in a broader effort to increase access for low-income and first-generation applicants, these two practices are actually irreconcilable. This contradictory approach — where the University extols the value of equitable access on the one hand and defends the seemingly arbitrary preference it gives to the children of its alums on the other — calls into question its level of commitment to a truly inclusive admission policy in the first place.</p>
<p class="p2">It goes without saying that abolishing legacy admission is not a panacea. Ending it will not, by itself, lead to an increase in socioeconomic diversity on campus. Truly crafting an admission policy that prioritizes merit and equal access requires a constellation of interacting policies that the University working group will, hopefully, have an opportunity to flesh out. But ending the consideration of legacy status in admission should be among them.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve never been a patient person. I often feel myself rushing: through tests in order to finish faster, through friendships by oversharing very early on, through books to get to the end. This impatience has permeated and defined several aspects of my life, especially my transition to college. I applied early decision to Brown, so I’ve been impatient about coming to Providence since December.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Waiting for Aug. 31 made summer long and short. Most of my friends headed to college earlier than me, some several weeks before. Parties and new faces sprung up on their Snapchat stories right away. Little did I know that these first few months of my transition to Brown were going to put my impatience to the test.</p>
<p class="p2">After flying to Boston, driving to Providence, spending an anxious night in an Airbnb, running to Target, rearranging all the furniture in the dorm, hanging up photos on the wall with Command tape, dining in a nice restaurant for the last time in a while and saying goodbye to my parents, I sizzled with dissatisfaction once orientation began when my roommate and I were just chilling in our dorm, day after day.</p>
<p class="p2">Freshman orientation was very good at overwhelming me and pretty bad at making me feel included. Intense individualism and a lack of effective icebreakers made making friends immediately a little tougher than I had expected. I was jealous of the people who went to A Day on College Hill and pre-orientation programs because they had found a niche and narrowed down the pool of people already. I was jealous of the people who knew seven-plus kids from their graduating class. I was especially jealous of people who could go home for a weekend.</p>
<p class="p2">“What now?” my impatience seemed to ask me, wondering where all my lifelong friends, my laundry list of activities, my cool new internship and my hot college bae(s) were. As I finished the first few weeks of college without checking these boxes, my impatience got louder and louder.</p>
<p class="p2">Examining what made settling into Brown take longer than I expected has been kind of hard. Brown is incredibly decentralized, even past orientation. Students are expected to self-govern in all ways, from the open curriculum to ResLife’s rules to weekend nights. This adjustment from complete structure to almost none at all took more initiative than I thought it would. The school is big enough that it’s hard to randomly run into certain people. (And small enough that you see the same randos everywhere.) I began to feel foolish for comparing myself to my other friends from home. No college experiences are comparable, across campuses or within them.</p>
<p class="p2">Somewhere between orientation week and now, my impatience got busy. It had me join a club or two and do hours of homework and get a job. I had been waiting for my college experience to happen automatically. But I realized Brown isn’t like me. It doesn’t overshare or bare its soul at the beginning to get you in. Instead, Brown is kind of shy. You’ve got to do a little work to make its real heart show — the one the tour guides gush about.</p>
<p class="p2">I always considered my impatience something that held me back, something that kept me from living in the moment. I’m thankful now, as first semester comes to a slippery close, that I wasn’t satisfied with being a passive recipient of a prepackaged college experience. Brown’s self-governance is overall extremely positive, and I’m incredibly grateful for the academic, personal and institutional freedom. Creating my own structure has been a necessary and slow trial-and-error process involving lots of Ratty takeout boxes eaten hurriedly on the way to class.</p>
<p class="p2">If you’ve found that Brown hasn’t immediately welcomed you, don’t be scared off from its first semester impression. One needs to narrow everything here down to a manageable size. To get through the day I try to schedule in time with new friends. To get through the week I make complex to-do lists. To get through the semester I just worry about each day.</p>
<p class="p2">My impatience is finally satisfied by keeping busy. I know this school is perfect for me, and that I belong here. I feel this when I climb the stairs of the Granoff Center to nestle into the geometric cozy chairs to study, procrastinate by flipping through Courses@Brown for the millionth time and attend events like Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere’s eviction talk in the very same auditorium where I attended an info session while visiting. I’m still figuring this whole thing out, but these experiences each signal I’m on the right track.</p>

		<title>Miller &#039;19: The burden of winning a House majority</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Democrats achieved a resounding victory in the 2018 midterm elections, which will allow them to seat enough party members to assume control of the U.S. House of Representatives in January. These seats should provide a powerful check on President Trump and Republicans, whose control of both the House and the Senate had allowed them to advance their own legislative agenda. Now Democrats will again have a voice in governing, but the party is at a crossroads on how to use this power effectively and responsibly in an increasingly polarized and erratic political climate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some Democrats have already made plans for how they believe the next two years should look — inundating Trump and executive branch officials with House hearings, investigations and subpoenas. Yes, there is a wide range of alarming possibilities for potential investigations that could even lay the groundwork for impeachment — Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia, his violation of election laws, his refusal to make public his tax returns and his disaffinity for the truth quickly come to mind. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These investigations could have positive consequences — bringing to light unknowns about Trump and his stalwarts, squaring public opinion with reality, re-enforcing the rule of law and halting and potentially punishing any illegal practices by Trump and those in his administration. Yet I believe Democratic leaders of the House should exercise extreme caution when bringing about House investigations or utilizing other tactics which may stymie legislative progress. It is manifest that an onslaught of investigations will lead to the hardening of party divisions and the creation of fodder for Republicans to censure Democrats. It is not the proper function of either political party to cause stagnation. For the good of the United States, the new House should assume the moral high ground, avoid indulgent retribution and instead act constructively. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most pertinently, the House mechanisms for accountability do not promise Democrats’ desired outcome but would further exacerbate partisanship in and beyond Washington. To begin, the subpoena of executive branch officials — ordering someone to attend a House Committee hearing or produce information — is the beginning of an arduous process with no guarantees. A president can specifically assert “executive privilege” and refuse to comply with the subpoena on national security grounds. Others without such sweeping privilege can simply refuse to comply, which begins a long legal battle rather than a swift avenue of recourse. Congress can have the House Sergeant At Arms physically arrest the offender, put them on trial in front of the House and detain them in a quaint jail on the Capitol property. But this is not the goal, and while this idea may seem tempting, it has today become taboo and politically lamentable to resort to such an extreme measure. The House may also attempt to enforce the subpoena in the federal courts under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. This may seem like a victory. However, defense tactics will be geared toward tying up cases while awaiting the expiration of House members’ two-year terms in the hopes of a more favorable House climate or an agenda shifted away from investigations. If the lower courts rule that the subpoena is enforceable, the case could even go to the U.S. Supreme Court, whose current conservative majority might expand the executive branch’s immunity from congressional oversight. And time goes on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All the while, Trump will be able to stoke the fire against Democrats. He has already attacked the idea of investigations, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/in-new-oversight-role-cummings-pledges-aggressive-scrutiny-of-trump/2018/11/07/12a12db4-e2a7-11e8-8f5f-a55347f48762_story.html?utm_term=.c9fe5acc2653">tweeting</a>, “If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!” While Trump does not have a complete grasp of the capabilities of the executive branch, he can utilize his veto power to make it harder for the House to pass legislation. He will demonize Democrats in the eyes of his supporters by crying “witch hunt.” A drawn-out process will only give Trump years of material to make Democrats look like weak power-grabbers and pull those tired of politics into his camp. Again, news cycle after news cycle will be focused on Trump, while meaningful legislative change, if attained at all, will be buried in the back sections. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lastly, Trump, never an ideologue, has proved himself a capricious politician willing to switch opinions or radically alter his alliances at the drop of a hat. He has already made a nod to passing bipartisan legislation on a number of common grounds — health care, pharmaceutical drug prices, trade, the environment and infrastructure. Passage of these bills would be valuable to the country, not just to Democrats looking to make progressive change in an increasingly deadlocked Congress. However, with Trump taking a “warlike posture” stoked by House investigations, he will view Democrats as the enemy he must destroy rather than a potential ally. This could be a missed opportunity for Democrats who could put their distaste aside to make a meaningful impact on citizens’ lives. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I do not think we should ignore past and future woes and potential crimes committed by Trump and his ilk. At the same time, I do not believe House investigations are the way to unite our country or effectively hold Trump accountable. Democrats need to think about the consequences of inundating an erratic and already-challenged president with congressional investigations. Who knows what he might do or fail to do? Tit for tat is not a reason, nor is juicy news. The only legitimate reason is producing benefits that exceed the costs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The cost of overwhelming the administration with investigations will be high. The process is cumbersome and the result is by no means settled. But it is assured that time and energy of every legislator on both sides of the aisle will be co-opted for at least the next two years. The Trump knot of illogic and lack of productivity will continue and many Democrats will be painted with the same brush. This is an opportunity for Democrats to show that they recognize their responsibility; that they are focused on the future of the United States and not just their political affiliation or political self-interest; that they know how and why the American system works and will make it do so again. The country is watching. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the Democrats’ long-expected reclamation of the House of Representatives last week, President Trump and his allies certainly anticipate the beginning of a fierce Democratic backlash. Why else fire former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who in the president’s own depiction has failed to adequately “protect” him and his family from the Mueller investigation, the day after the midterm elections? And yet despite the White House’s own defensive maneuvers, the supposed threat, both to Trump himself and to the Republican movement as a whole, could well be overblown. All indications from Nancy Pelosi, the expected new Speaker of the House, suggest the party will <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nancy-pelosi-house-minority-leader-news-conference-democrats-win-house-of-representatives-today-2018-11-07/">meet Republicans in a center</a> that has shifted dramatically to the right. When compared to the rise of the Tea Party in 2010, the incoming Democrats lack a unifying message and strategy to provide the first meaningful checks on Trumpism since 2016. They need to find one, and soon.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why? California is burning, voter suppression is widespread, journalists are being demonized, mass shootings turn places of joy and community into war zones and Trump’s authoritarian, xenophobic populism continues to isolate the United States from its closest allies. And that’s just in the week since the midterm elections. If elected Democrats can’t find a cause to rally around, whether from that list or from any of the myriad breakdowns our political institutions and our planet are suffering, Trump and his allies really can get away with anything. If they need help picking, let me offer two: the dual degradations of our political system and our climate, both of which are in dire need of rescue.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s now time for Democrats to turn up the heat on this fundamentally abnormal presidency. Moderates elected by slim margins in conservative states may protest that their base will object to their involvement in petty politicking, but Trump’s recent actions — the firing of Sessions, his disregard for veterans and the American role in international leadership, his treatment of journalists and attempts to subvert the voting process — represent violations of the Constitution and of core American values. “Moderates” who can’t get behind rebukes of actions like these aren’t really moderates; remember that it was not so long ago that Senator Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/09/lindsey-graham-holy-hell-pay-if-sessions-is-fired-when-was-that-what-year/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.7da59487d93c">said</a> there would be “holy hell to pay” for the firing of Sessions. Standing up to Trump when it comes to the norms of law and governance — which, yes, may involve impeachment if his actions come to that — should be the first thing disparate Democrats can agree on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While reining in Trump’s worst excesses may be Democrats’ best chance to unite and build a firewall, it is not a substitute for positive action, particularly not on issues where time is of the essence. Climate change has progressed to a point where waiting for the next president to come into power is no longer a viable solution. Things have changed since 2010, when concerted action by right-wing groups made support for climate legislation, particularly the cap-and-trade bill that was on the floor at the time, an effective death sentence for moderate Republicans and vulnerable Democrats. Today, far more Americans (unfortunately, more and more each day) have had personal experiences with climate change or have family members who have. The percentage of Americans who support more government action on climate change is at its <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/232007/americans-want-government-more-environment.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&amp;g_medium=TOPIC&amp;g_campaign=item_&amp;g_content=Americans%2520Want%2520Government%2520to%2520Do%2520More%2520on%2520Environment">highest since 2006</a>, before it became a politicized issue in the form it is today, and a majority support environmental legislation even at the expense of economic growth. The political (and economic, thanks to the falling price of renewable energy) costs of fighting climate change are lower than they have been in over a decade, while the costs of inaction climb every day. With time running out, Democrats should make as much noise as possible on this existential issue.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It has never been more important for Democrats to zero in on an agenda with the modicum of power they now possess. The two issues presented here are the two for which inaction would bear the gravest consequences, for which future generations will look back and wonder why we didn’t do more when we had the chance. Of course, there are other causes where life is on the line: health care, gun violence, police brutality and economic inequality, just to name a few. But these two stand alone in the threats they pose not just to our own country but to the rest of the world. American leadership has dissolved, as the world saw this weekend from a rainy battlefield in France, memorializing the same war that catapulted our nation into global leadership in the first place. Democrats have a chance to salvage the values of our nation, but only with a clear-minded attitude of focus, determination and a willingness to fight hard. Their responsibility on this matter cannot be overstated, and history will remember if they choose capitulation over change.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">An amazing opportunity for Brown students is the exposure to people from a variety of cultures and backgrounds and getting to learn from their experiences. But there’s a group of students that is often overlooked, with not many people understanding the burdens upon them: those coming from single-parent households — who have only one parent in their lives. These students and their plights often go unnoticed at Brown and in the Ivy League community at large.</p>
<p class="p1">The psychological and communal impact of a single-parent household goes beyond having only one parent come for Family Weekend or watching friends an<span class="s1">d peers show both of their parents around campus. Having one parent’s income to fall back on and working to pay off loans can be an overwhelming burden. Yet these struggles extend beyond economic factors and can have a significant impact on mental health. According to a 2006 U.K. study on childhood mental illness and divorce <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/21/mentalhealth.childrensservices">conducted by the Office for National Statistics</a>, 13 percent of girls who had a divorced or widowed parent had a mental disorder, compared to 5 percent of girls whose parents were still together. The statistics for boys in the study echoed a similar trend: Almost 20 percent of boys living with a single parent had similar experiences with mental illness, compared to 8 percent of boys coming from a two-parent household. In addition, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/08/29/study-children-divorce-less-likely-earn-degree">numerous studies</a> have shown how students from divorced families are educationally disadvantaged and less likely to </span>pursue higher education.</p>
<p class="p1">Students from single-parent households face specific challenges in the college application process. If they have big dreams of attending a top university, like an Ivy League school, to further their education, the odds are stacked even further against them. A study conducted by researchers at Cornell in 1996 showed that children whose parents are divorced are only half a<span class="s1">s likely to attend a top, selective school compared to those coming from a two-parent background. <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/1996/05/children-divorced-families-only-half-likely-go-top-college-cornell-research-shows">The same study</a> also showed that in a class at Cornell, only 10 percent of the student body was from a single-parent household, compared to the national divorce rate at the time of roughly 50 percent</span>. There are a variety of factors that help explain the disproportiona<span class="s1">tely low number of students from divorced families who attain college degrees — from lower average test scores to a decr</span>eased likelihood of participating in extracurriculars.</p>
<p class="p1">Given so many socioeconomic factors that students from single-parent households face, it is astounding these students, myself included, were able to attend elite universities. I remember when I first came to Brown, I grazed my palm over the Gate and all of its gilded years, in awe that despite all I had faced in my childhood, I was still graced with the opportunity to attend one of the top institutions in the world. My mother always reminded me of where I came from — an only child from a household that was torn apart when I was just nine years old. I was supposed to “become a statistic,” as she put it, and never go as far as I, and my peers who have come from a similar background, have gone.</p>
<p class="p1">And yet, it seems as though not many people in the Brown community talk about this struggle. Chil<span class="s1">d support and parental income are factored into financial aid packages, but awareness and understanding of the plight of those who have made it here despite all odds are lacking. Because of the small proportion of students from divorced households coming into the Ivy League and into the Brown community, thinking about the struggles these students face can be out of sight and out of mind for the majority of the community. B</span>ut, especially in a community in which students from the top 1 percent outnumber those from the bottom 60, acknowledging the adversity faced by students who have only one parent in their lives is essential to erase the isolation students from single-parent households may feel. Their struggles should not be invisible, and they should be proud that in spite of everything, they are still standing and thriving at a top university.</p>

		<title>Meszaros GS: Better pedestrian signals for a safer Providence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On my short walk to campus, I cross intersections with pedestrian traffic signals where the light has burnt out, where the light never changes and where the whole light pole has been turned to face away from the intersection. While much of pedestrian safety is beyond the power of these little lighted signs, their presence stands stalwart in the fight to ensure the safety of walking traffic. Why, then, are so many in such a state of disrepair?</p>
<p class="p2">Providence should pay attention to pedestrian traffic signals to ensure the safety of pedestrians, taking action to fix the ones we have while also changing how they function and how we, as a society, interact with them. The campus organization Safety at Brown offers little advice on dealing with pedestrian signals. “Pay attention,” <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/safety/resources/pedestrian-safety">they write</a>, “to traffic lights and signals at crosswalks,” places where traffic flow is predictable and steady. Their link to the U.S. Department of <span class="s1">Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is broken, but the intrepid internet user can find on this website pedestrian safety statistics from 2016 — the most recent year available — that indicate a 9-percent increase nationwide in pedestrian fatalities over the previous year, marking the highest number since 1990. Increasing the safety of walking traffic is critical and should be a focus for a college city with a young population and limited parking opportunities. Pedestrian signal lights that are broken should be fixed. Signs that are missing or tilted should be replaced. But more than that, we as a community need to understand the role these signals play and how to interact with them as pedestrians and as drivers.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Many issues with pedestrian signals can be addressed through physical repairs. Taking stock of lights that are burnt out, broken or otherwise damaged would allow the city to restore them to functioning order. Repair is critical because the presence of pedestrian signals at intersections suggests to those walking and driving alike that there is a pattern that should be followed. It leads drivers to assume, however correctly, that pedestrians will only be found in the intersection when the signal indicates that this is okay. Without a functioning traffic light, pedestrians will cross not necessarily unsafely or against the flow of traffic but certainly against typical traffic light patterns, placing them in potential danger from drivers who don’t expect them to be there.</p>
<p class="p2">Educating drivers on how to interpret pedestrian signals is also important. A few weeks ago, I had begun crossing an intersection with a “walk” signal, which transitioned to the blinking “don’t walk” signal to indicate I could finish crossing but shouldn’t start. A car turned left into my crosswalk and nearly ran into me. He gestured angrily out his window at the blinking “don’t walk” sign as if to suggest that he had the right-of-way and the near-incident was my own fault. Ensuring pedestrian safety in situations like this is less the fault of the traffic signal than it is of how drivers are taught to interpret it. But a sign is only meaningful in its interpretation; if a blinking “don’t walk” sign is assigned different meanings by pedestrians and automobile traffic, then it can’t ensure safety — it can’t do its job.</p>
<p class="p2">There are more difficult actions that must be taken regarding these traffic signals, however, focused on more entrenched issues. Many pedestrian traffic signals operate in a mode where they remain illuminating the “don’t walk” hand unless a button is pressed, even when the traffic light in the direction of travel is green. Sometimes pressing this button affects traffic patterns, stopping or altering traffic to provide safe crossing opportunities. Other times, this button just alerts the light to signal a safe time to walk when traffic is flowing in the same direction as the pedestrian. In either case, the pedestrian often has to wait a full cycle or more in order to cross safely. Many pedestrians know this and, rather than waiting, will take opportunities of pauses in traffic flow to cross the street against the traffic sign.</p>
<p class="p2">While this may be illegal action, it is not necessarily unsafe action. Crossing with the flow of traffic and at a designated crosswalk is exactly the correct, safe practice for cases where activating the pedestrian signal doesn’t change traffic patterns either quickly or at all. It becomes problematic, however, if drivers assume that the pedestrian signal means the crosswalk will be empty. Additionally, a green traffic light doesn’t always guarantee a pedestrian enough time to cross the street safely, while pedestrian signals give an indication of how much time is left. The dysfunction of pedestrian signals may therefore turn a safe crossing into an illegal action and make it unsafe.</p>
<p class="p2">For lights that don’t impact traffic patterns, where pushing the button for a pedestrian signal doesn’t change the traffic lights for automobiles: Automate the walk signals to change with traffic. Simply ensuring that the pedestrian traffic signal is aligned with the traffic light (instead of defaulting to “don’t walk”) will certainly increase the frequency with which the signal is obeyed. Simple changes like this can encourage pedestrians to cross with the signal, increasing visibility and predictability for drivers and making it easier to tell whether they can finish crossing before the flow of traffic changes.</p>
<p class="p2">For a community, school and city with a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2010/09/03/michelle-uhrick-11-danger-students-crossing/">sufficient history of pedestrian accidents</a>, taking small actions to encourage continued pedestrian safety should be an easy choice. Replacing lights and fixing broken signals should be a priority. Re-evaluating how pedestrian traffic interacts with crosswalks, signals and traffic lights is an even more important step in improving how this campus and the city of Providence can be navigable and safe.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A week ago, Edward Steinfeld, director of the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, emailed development studies, international relations and public policy concentrators with an update on the proposed restructuring of Watson’s concentrations. For those who have not kept up with the drama, the Dean of the College assembled a committee in April to re-evaluate the Watson’s undergraduate programs, as The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/29/report-suggests-combining-watson-concentrations/">previously reported</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In its report, the committee made the awful recommendation of combining elements from the three disparate concentrations into a single concentration called “global studies.” Fortunately, Friday’s update reassured us that this recommendation was “in no way the final plan,” though Watson is still “determined to address” the same issues that inspired the original plan and will draft a proposal for the direction of its concentrations by December. We therefore want to offer advice for future changes — primarily to save the public policy concentration from losing some of its interdisciplinary appeal to double concentrators.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Public policy, as it currently stands, is especially attractive to double concentrators since it has only 11 requirements. According to the report, half of all public policy students double concentrate, whereas only approximately 20 percent of Brown students do so. Public policy also allows for its concentrators to engage in other interdisciplinary pursuits, including the engaged scholars program — which adds four requirements — and the semester-long Brown in Washington program. In a 2015 review of the concentration, Watson opted to keep the small number of requirements, possibly in order to satisfy the interests of double concentrators. And public policy’s popularity is on the rise: Watson expects the number of concentrators to grow by 20 percent within the next year, according to the report. Clearly, public policy lends itself well to interdisciplinarily-minded students.</p>
<p class="p2">We are worried that the potential changes to Watson will sacrifice the virtues of public policy to the vices of a conglomerate of different disciplines. The recommendation in April proposed 20 or 21 requirements, with study abroad also “strongly recommended.” Some of those requirements include language requirements, which could be especially disastrous to public policy concentrators because learning a language is guaranteed to take up at least six semesters. Though last Friday’s update said that the language requirement is not confirmed and merely in discussion, it is clear that increasing the number of requirements for public policy concentrators is at the least being considered. Double concentrating would be practically impossible with the proposed changes to the Watson curriculum: Students would have to take almost every class during their four years for either of the two concentrations. That would probably deter most of them.</p>
<p class="p2">One of Watson’s goals for the proposed changes is to “ensure that offerings are meeting the urgency of our current global moment.” But this rhetoric is inconsistent with the substance of the changes. The increasing complexity of the world clearly requires interdisciplinary modes of thinking. One subset of students that stands to lose from a change to public policy are STEM students: According to department data, STEM students are double concentrating in public policy in increasingly large numbers. For instance, it is not uncommon to pair a public policy concentration with cognitive neuroscience, computer science or the pre-med track. These STEM students can use the public policy degree to apply their hard-hearted disciplines to a social context. Brown, moreover, prides itself on the freedom to design individualized and specific courses of study. The public policy concentration, as it currently stands, facilitates such freedom well. An amalgam of disparate fields and an addition of concentration requirements would stifle such freedom.</p>
<p class="p2">In an ideal world, the public policy concentration would stay as is. But if it has to change, then we implore Watson to add no extraneous requirements — and especially no language requirement — in order to preserve the great opportunity of interdisciplinary study.</p>

		<title>Simshauser &#039;20: A retreat from the center</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As the final provisional ballots from the 2018 midterm elections are counted, and the forecasted Democratic wave in the House becomes more precise (most likely a gain of at least 37 seats), the electoral significance can be parsed. Certainly, exit polls from the House have already revealed concrete changes in the electorate that led to the Democrats’ triumph, such as their massive gains among women and increased turnout. When the vote tallies are finalized, Democrats will have won the House popular vote by between 7 and 8 percentage points — the largest disparity since 2006, and larger than either Republican wave in 2010 or 1994. For most everyone (New York Times columnist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/opinion/midterm-results-2020-democrats.html">Bret Stephens</a> notwithstanding), there is little question that this was a “wave election,” at least in the House.</p>
<p class="p2">However, it is elsewhere that the significance of national politics must be more rigorously examined. Democrats faced a difficult Senate map in 2018, with seven incumbents running in states that voted for President Trump in 2016. As Democrats look to 2020 and beyond, they would do well to learn from their senatorial and gubernatorial races in Trump states: Rather than run quasi-conservative campaigns to persuade the elusive “Obama-Trump” voter, they should turn to progressive candidates who inspire the base and boost turnout.</p>
<p class="p2">In Texas and Georgia, the benefits of a progressive candidate were manifest in both turnout and down-ballot results. While former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) lost his senatorial bid, and Stacy Abrams is likely to lose her gubernatorial race, the significance of the results extends beyond the binary outcome of the headline races. Up and down the ballot in Texas, the “Beto effect” could be seen; voter turnout spiked to <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2018g">46.1 percent</a>, leaps and bounds above the dismal 28.3 percent turnout rate from <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2014g">2014</a>, according to Elect Project. Voters who turned out in droves for Beto helped elect Democrats down the ballot in Texas; the party flipped two seats in Republican districts and came within a hair of unseating another Republican (Will Hurd) in the 23rd district.</p>
<p class="p2">In the Peach State, Abrams’ campaign remained firmly progressive, even while running against arch-conservative Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Despite fairly comprehensive reports of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/brian-kemp-340000-voters-748165/">voter suppression</a>, she came within two percentage points of winning. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-georgia-elections.html">the Times</a>, she garnered over 1.9 million votes — the highest Democratic vote total in the state’s history. Similar to the races in Texas, the downstream effect of Abrams’ campaign netted substantial gains for Democrats. They flipped a House seat in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-georgia-elections.html">Georgia’s</a> 6th district, came within 800 votes of unseating Rep. Rob Woodall in the 7th district and gained 13 seats in the state house. A more orthodox political strategy would have advised for a centrist campaign. Georgia is both ideologically and politically red; moreover, her opponent happily aligned himself with national Republicans, identifying as a “proud, hardcore Trump conservative” in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6htgrVPi7A">campaign ad</a>. By valuing a coherent campaign message, even at the cost of alienating a fraction of moderate voters, Abrams juiced turnout to 55 percent (up from 38.6 percent in 2014), boosted other Georgia Democratic candidates and set a high-water mark for liberal success in the state. Though Abrams ultimately conceded the governorship, her success in energizing the Democratic base shows that progressive values can find traction in conservative states.</p>
<p class="p2">Elsewhere in the country, the failure of moderate Democratic incumbents underscored the fallacy of a centrist campaign. In Indiana, lame duck Sen. Joe Donnelly ran a confusing campaign as a “Trump Democrat.” His ads tried to highlight his streaks of conservatism: “I split with my party,” Donnelly says in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf-p0FWDZ8U&amp;t=22s">one commercial</a>, “to support funding for Trump’s border wall.” He quotes former President Reagan in a different ad and brags about being called “the most moderate Democrat in the Senate” in yet another. On election day, Donnelly was trounced by GOP challenger Mike Braun; though he polled as a slight favorite, Donnelly ended up losing by six percentage points, according to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-indiana-elections.html"> the Times</a>. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-missouri-elections.html">Missouri</a>, outgoing Sen. Claire McCaskill’s similarly moderate campaign resulted in an identical six percentage point loss to challenger Josh Hawley. And North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp — who possesses an A rating from the National Rifle Association — was decimated in her re-election bid, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-north-dakota-elections.html">losing</a> to Rep. Kevin Cramer by 11 percentage points. These three outgoing Democrats had a moderate voting record to match their campaign rhetoric. Per FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/">“Trump Score,”</a> Donnelly, McCaskill and Heitkamp voted with Trump more than any Democratic senator aside from West Virginia’s Joe Manchin.</p>
<p class="p2">As the outgoing incumbents learned, Democratic campaign strategy ought to focus on accentuating turnout, not converting moderate voters. Donnelly’s confusing centrism fell flat with the younger coalition in the electorate — voters between ages 18 and 29 voted for Donnelly by a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/exit-polls/indiana">slim margin</a> of 48 to 45 percent, compared to a 67 to 32 percent nationwide disparity in youth support for Democrats as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/exit-polls/">CNN reported</a> in their midterm election coverage. Turnout in Indiana, typically a fairly active state, was just 46.1 percent, falling below the national average. Rather than trying to craft a clear message promoting liberal values, Donnelly fell into the old paradigm and ran a risk-averse campaign. Fearful of alienating any one voter, he failed to see the potential gains to be had by inspiring progressive, young voters. Ultimately, the success of Democrats who held fast to an uncompromising message of progressivism hints at a 2020 plan. This extends beyond O’Rourke and Abrams — Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin both easily secured re-election in states that voted for Trump. Indeed, as the next round of elections approaches, Democrats should recognize this lesson from 2018: As a campaign strategy, coherent progressive messaging is superior to performative conservatism.</p>

		<title>Meszaros GS: Centralize access to online tools</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Preregistration for spring 2019 courses took place just a few weeks ago, a process that reminded me of the number of different online tools required to navigate my Brown education. While registration seemed to occur without incident, it highlighted one aspect of these online tools that could easily be made more straightforward and intuitive: the lack of a centralized method for accessing each online system.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many aspects of managing my Brown education are accessible through online portals. However, these systems are all distinct and feature separate login screens, different points of access and distinct names. Remembering where to find each piece of information and which site needs to be accessed is sometimes challenging. Providing students with a centralized access point for all pieces of their online education would reduce frustration and ensure that nothing is overlooked.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For preregistration, my primary point of contact with Brown’s online systems was Courses@Brown, which allowed me to view classes and eventually select and register for my courses of choice. To pay for my classes, however, I needed to visit the Billing Center, where I pay my tuition and associated fees. Of course, as a student employee I also needed to check in with Workday to monitor my payslips and verify when I could make a payment. I needed to see my finalized class schedule to avoid conflicts with other academic and extracurricular activities, which I access through Banner. Once classes get going, I’ll need to check the online course management tool, Canvas, where my professors upload electronic copies of syllabi and course readings. In order to print this material, I need to add money to my Bear Bucks account through the GET Portal and send these documents to the printer via MyPrint. Then, of course, there are systems like the Health Portal, which stores records of immunizations and allows me to make health services appointments, or the Health Insurance Portal, which allows me to see my coverage, find doctors in the area and manage Brown University Health Insurance plans for my spouse and me. The list of different online systems and identities to manage is clearly non-trivial.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Each online tool has a reason for existing, and I appreciate the fact that I can take all of these actions online. However, with so many different web tools, there needs to be an easy way to find and access all of them. Currently, each online portal requires a separate login and is reachable from separate launch pages. Finding the required page is often only accomplished with the aid of a Google search. Navigating online systems does not need to be this complex. Implementing a centralized access point for all these functions could reduce the number of necessary logins and make finding specific options easier for students. Obfuscating usability in this way contributes to lost information and incomplete tasks, from failing to submit necessary documentation to not taking advantage of available options.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Case in point: I’ve set up multiple Brown email aliases, something I found I could do when exploring some online portal over the summer. Other students have seemed surprised by this, unaware that it was a feature offered by the University. Making features difficult to find prevents students from taking advantage of them. Consolidating online functionality and creating a centralized point of access can increase general use and help make functions that once were difficult to find common knowledge. I unfortunately am unable to remember where I found the email alias functionality, and so I suspect my interlocutors forgot about this quest. Not setting up multiple email aliases isn’t a big deal, but what about cases where the functionality in question is more important? What about when it’s an international student submitting visa-related tax forms on Workday or a trans student identifying a chosen name in Banner? Ensuring ease-of-access for all of these online tools isn’t merely a matter of convenience but could contribute to student well-being.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Importantly, it’s not that the current systems are unusable. Students, myself included, are able to navigate these sprawling online spaces regardless of how unconnected each node is. But it doesn’t have to be a mess of unconnected endpoints. Other universities have created systems that are more centralized — I myself have experience with more coherent systems at the University of Chicago and Eastern Michigan University where almost all online tools are accessed through one central hub. Creating a centralized access point is an easy action that the University could take to make the process of using these online tools more intuitive and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.</span></p>

		<title>Fernandez &#039;21: The responsibility of privilege</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This year’s midterm elections boasted the highest voter turn-out rates in half a century — resulting in a major win for Democrats in the House of Representatives and significant strides in diversifying representation, especially for women of color. However, in general, Tuesday’s results left many on both sides of the aisle unsatisfied, myself included. I voted, and I’m glad I voted. But I am now more sure than ever that just voting is not enough.</p>
<p class="p2">Young people who share this feeling of wanting to go further to enact social and institutional change face varying and often conflicting considerations that make academic and career choices uncertain and daunting. Universities, the professional and social centers for these young people, are failing to provide the necessary support to help students work through these uncertainties. What’s more, the intellectual elitism rampant in these spaces often deters social and institutional change. It is much too easy and much too common for administrators, professors and students to limit themselves to the conceptual inquiries that dominate the modern academic sphere. However, universities and all of their participants have a responsibility to support and encourage the pursuit of social influence and reform. Our privilege as the intellectual elite allows and therefore requires that we explore our role as agents of change.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Careers grounded in the goal of social and institutional change range across countless fields and can take on wildly different forms. This fact makes it difficult for universities to provide support to students engaged in this pursuit. Still, there is room for growth in the way that universities are addressing the immense question of how students can effectively participate in change. The most immediate and accessible response is for universities to begin to offer more resources to students, particularly in the way of creating spaces dedicated to addressing this question. These spaces must go beyond the mere “Education for Democracy” that publications such as <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2018/07/23/colleges-must-do-more-teach-students-about-voting-and-democracy-opinion">Inside Higher Ed</a> have called for, which demand that students learn to be responsible citizens and engage in the political process. Instead, universities must recognize that students who have a privileged access to education carry a responsibility to contribute meaningfully to society. </span></p>
<p class="p2">In the context of universities, students who aspire to effect change face challenges beyond what can be fixed by mere institutional reform. There is a certain mindset of indifference and resignation embedded in the exercises of the high academic sphere that conflicts with the pursuit of social and institutional change. It is easy to get lost in the overwhelming power of the structures that govern our world when studying these structures so thoroughly. Our education, which encourages us to dive into the historical intricacies and theoretical complications of current social and political frameworks, often pushes us toward the conclusion that we have no ability to influence these forces in a meaningful way. Furthermore, there is a tendency in academia to look down upon the individual who works to move past these inclinations. Those who express a desire to enact on-the-ground change are often considered naive instead of ambitious. I believe it is essential for us to look beyond these large-scale, highly theoretical understandings that dominate university discourse. Appreciating the complexities of world systems does not mean we must disregard the power we could have to influence them. If anything, our depth of knowledge makes us even more capable of making a difference. I argue it is the responsibility of universities to engage in this process of reimagining.</p>
<p class="p2">Deeper still than university guidance or understanding the impact of personal influence, there is another consideration that I believe firmly cements our responsibility as agents of change. We must consider ourselves within a larger context and recognize the power and responsibility that our position of privilege entails. Dedicating our lives to social and institutional change can be difficult when many believe enacting such change is an unobtainable goal. However, I think it is the responsibility of students at elite institutions such as Brown to be aware that there is too much at stake to let uncertainty derail action. I cannot pretend to know if in the end this pursuit will be fulfilling or result in meaningful change. However, I can claim that if there is anyone to resign themselves to indifference, it is not the Brown student with access to a world of possibilities that most of the rest of the world could only ever dream of. Instead, this possibility of meaningful influence urges us, at the very least, to attempt to participate as agents of change.</p>

		<title>Cardoso &#039;19: Make Brown athletic facilities public</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I don’t play basketball. It’s nothing against the sport itself, but I never grew up playing it. While I like to think it was just chance that led me to sign up for other sports during my childhood, I reluctantly admit that even in middle school, I recognized that I lacked the — ahem — vertical prerequisites for success in basketball. From time to time, though, (as we all do) I find myself talking about things that don’t particularly interest me. And indeed, during the beginning of the semester, I found myself talking to a friend who worked at the front desk of the Olney-Margolies Athletic Center about what I thought would be the most boring, most anodyne job on campus — essentially serving as a gatekeeper to the recreational basketball courts. So I innocently asked them how they liked the job, expecting them to tell me it was, in fact, the most boring, most anodyne job on campus. That isn’t quite how they responded, though. They told me they disliked their job. They said they didn’t like how they were required almost daily to turn away local high school students looking to play basketball. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University is transparent about its policy toward members of the Providence community using its athletic facilities. It notes on its <a href="https://brownrec.com/sports/2018/4/27/inside-rec-facilities-omac.aspx">website</a> that guests — that is, non-Brown or RISD students, faculty or staff — must pay a daily $10 fee to use its facilities, like the basketball courts in the OMAC. But that there is actually demand from other members of the Providence community for access to these facilities was, at least to me, less obvious. Trivial as this might seem, it is through small interactions like these that Brown establishes its reputation in the community. And while it goes without saying that Brown is most interested in serving the needs and wants of its own students, faculty and staff, that does not mean it has no obligations to the community, and it certainly does not justify adopting an arbitrarily exclusive policy. Opening the OMAC and other athletic facilities, even if it’s only for publicized, fixed “open hours” a few times a week, is a small but important gesture that would not only provide young people in Providence a valuable service, but also help to cultivate a stronger sense that Brown is more than just an ivory tower that exclusively serves its own interests.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, in conversations I’ve had with friends about this topic, I’ve heard objections. Primarily, I’ve been told that the University should care for members of its own community first, and that by opening up athletic facilities to the public, we’re diluting the quality of the services students pay for (through overcrowding, increasing the likelihood of damage to facilities, etc.). I’m not sympathetic to this argument for several reasons. First, while Brown should prioritize the needs of its students, it still carries a responsibility to support members of the Providence community. Their argument becomes particularly facile when one considers that Brown pays nothing in taxes to the city, despite owning approximately 150 tax-exempt buildings with a combined valuation of over <a href="https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Review-of-RI-PILOT-Agreements-Narrative-September-29-2015.pdf">$1 billion</a>. Though the University does provide the city with payment in lieu of taxes, these payments are a fraction of what it would otherwise pay to the city. It is unreasonable, and borders on abject greed, to completely dismiss the notion that Brown has responsibilities beyond its own students, faculty and staff when one considers how we continue to benefit from the city’s good will.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s also uncompelling to assert that limited public access to athletic facilities would somehow take away from the quality of our experience. First, and perhaps most importantly, the current policy does not prohibit public access altogether — members of the community are still eligible to use athletic facilities even now, if they pay. The argument that public access somehow takes away from the experiences of members of the Brown community seems more like a pretext for exclusion rather than a legitimate justification for dismissing free public access. Though it’s true that eliminating the $10 fee during potential open hours would increase the amount of public demand for Brown’s athletic facilities during these times, it strains credulity to hold that this new increased usage would substantially detract from the experience of Brown community members. Mid-afternoon open hours on weekdays — the time local students would be most likely to use these facilities — hardly strikes me as a popular time for Brown students, faculty and staff to play basketball or run laps around the indoor track. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While this argument might seem frivolous, it highlights one of many small, effortless gestures the University can make to demonstrate that it is serious in its commitment to contribute meaningfully to the Providence community. The current policy toward public access to athletic facilities is prohibitively expensive for certain members of the community like high school students — and pointlessly so. By creating free open hours at its athletic facilities several times a week, Brown could, with minimal effort, take a meaningful step toward cultivating its role as a member of the Providence community.</span></p>

		<title>Allums &#039;21: Is the Brown Promise enough?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fall semester at Brown has invited the usual wave of prospective students crowding the entrance of the Stephen Robert ‘62 Campus Center before they embark on one of the highly recommended campus tours. The members who hope to join the Class of 2023 appear to follow the typical pattern, but there is something distinct about this round of applicants. In a recent Brown University Community Council meeting, Dean of Admission Logan Powell proudly announced that the amount of early decision applicants increased by 20 percent from 3,501 applicants for the class of 2022 to 4,169 applicants for the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/13/early-decision-applications-surge-class-2023/">class of 2023</a>. Furthermore, the number of early decision applicants who reported an interest in receiving financial aid grew by 11 percent in the last year. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Powell pins the growth in ED applicants largely to the implementation of the Brown Promise, an initiative that involves replacing loans with University scholarship funds in all undergraduate financial aid packages. This is another step in a process toward making a Brown education accessible to all families regardless of income. In 2008, Brown first replaced loans with University scholarships solely for families with a total parental income of less than $100,000, according to the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/financial-aid/financial-aid-basics">University’s financial aid website</a>. This opened Brown’s doors to many more low-income families, but did not reach those moderate-income families who did not qualify for the more generous financial aid that low-income families receive. The difference with the Brown Promise is the absence of the $100,000 threshold, which granted all undergraduate students loan-free financial aid packages beginning this year. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I remember reading the email announcing the Brown Promise and immediately texting my parents the news. I wanted them to join me in a refreshing wave of optimism after navigating the twists and turns of applying for financial aid as a middle-class family. My parents earn too much money to qualify for substantial financial aid, yet they do not earn enough to be able to comfortably afford my education. Surely enough, when I received my financial aid package for the 2018-19 school year, I found that what used to be loans were replaced by additional University scholarship funds. This change should have ushered in a new chapter of my college experience in which I would no longer be weighed down by the financial burden of my education. However, the relief only lasted briefly. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The fact is that eliminating loans from financial aid packages does not eliminate families’ need for them when they are not receiving sufficient aid in the first place. My experience has revealed a key inadequacy of the Brown Promise in making a significant change in my life and perhaps the lives of other moderate-income students. It should be made clear that the Brown Promise does not increase financial aid, but instead replaces loans with scholarships. Therefore, if the amount of financial aid that families receive remains insufficient, they will still have to request loans from Brown or seek private loans elsewhere, which often carry greater consequences such as higher interest rates and the lack of federal interest subsidies. Indeed, while replacing portions of tuition covered by loans with scholarships may decrease student debt after college, the Brown Promise makes little difference in the short-term affordability of an education. If the actual amount of financial aid does not increase, families will still struggle to afford the cost of attendance. As long as moderate-income families are unable to afford the family contribution that their existing financial aid packages demand, Brown will remain inaccessible to many students who wish to attend. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My hope is that the University does not assume that the spike in ED applicants signals that the problem has been solved. In order to expand financial accessibility to moderate-income students, Brown should adjust the manner in which financial aid eligibility is calculated so that the family contribution more adequately reflects families’ actual abilities to pay without having to request loans from the University or elsewhere. Financial anxiety makes it very difficult for students receiving aid to fully embrace all of the opportunities and connections that Brown offers. On multiple occasions, I have felt that my enrollment here hangs in the balance due to financial struggles. Moderate-income students work just as hard and are just as deserving of attending Brown as those who can afford full tuition, and it is cruel that the only obstacles standing in between them and a fulfilling education are financial circumstances beyond their control. Eliminating loans from financial aid packages is a step in the right direction toward resolving this issue, but increasing financial aid would go much further. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A chapter of One for the World is opening at Brown. OFTW is a national nonprofit organization that seeks to promote effective altruism — finding the most effective means of benefiting others, as informed by hard evidence — on college campuses. Started by Wharton MBA students, OFTW already has chapters at peer schools such as Columbia, Georgetown University and Harvard. An organization for effective altruism is a valuable addition to Brown, which is known for its culture of activism and engagement. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To illustrate the principle of effective altruism, here is a fairly straightforward philosophical dilemma, proposed by Peter Singer, the father of the effective altruism movement. Imagine that you are on your way to work and are walking next to a lake. You look and realize that a child is drowning in that lake. You have the opportunity to jump in to save him, but to do so would be inconvenient to you; you would get your clothes all wet and would then be late to work. Would you save the child? I imagine that everyone would do so without equivocation — the ethical obligation to the child’s life trumps the minor inconveniences. What if you were wearing an expensive suit that would be ruined by a jump into the lake? Still, the child’s life would be more important. Now imagine that the child lived in a distant country, yet you nonetheless had the power to save him and at only a small cost to yourself. Would you still be ethically obligated to do so?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To those who would answer affirmatively to that last question, effective altruism offers a way to help. Organizations guided by this principle, such as OFTW, help people to give rationally so as to get the greatest “bang for the buck.” They select charities that are the most effective — in terms of demonstrable outcomes, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and financial need, for example — and encourage people to donate to them. Because of these effective charities, it is relatively simple to help the equivalent of “the drowning child” in a distant country. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Effective altruism organizations have rigorous methodology for selecting charities. OFTW draws its charities from the nonprofit The Life You Can Save. Consider the Against Malaria Foundation, a favorite of effective altruists. It installs mosquito nets in places where malaria is still rampant. It estimates that every 50-250 mosquito nets installed — each of which costs a mere $2 — equals one life saved. Thus, it is estimated to cost between $100 and $500 to save a life. If many individuals donated just small amounts to the Against Malaria Foundation, then the sum of their donations could save an immense number of lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is why OFTW encourages students to pledge one percent of their future income to effective charities. What is to an individual a small amount can have a disproportionate impact. Students can choose the amount of money they want to donate and the frequency of their donations. They can choose among several effective charities. Importantly, they do not have to donate straightaway; a broke college student, weighed down by student loans, can pledge to donate once they receive an income by postponing their initial donation by up to three years later. And students are of course not bound to any commitment that they later might want to modify. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Assessing the effectiveness of a philanthropic organization is never an easy task, and some may voice reservations about the manner in which certain philanthropic organizations have navigated institutional power dynamics. But going so far as to dismiss all philanthropy as inherently flawed is simplistic and perhaps even irresponsible. As Brown students, we have an obligation to think about how we can use our resources to contribute meaningfully to the world in which we live, and effective altruism provides a robust starting point. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One common objection to the pledge is that one percent is too much money. But the average salary of Brown graduates is $63,000 per year. One percent of that would be a donation of $50 dollars per month, which over time will substantially help the recipients of the effective charities. Of course, a certain amount of money is not equally burdensome to everyone, and OFTW is not asking anyone to donate what one cannot afford. It is nevertheless helpful at least to put these numbers into perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another objection is that pledgers cannot be sure whether their money is actually going to help those whom it is intended to help or is instead being used irresponsibly by the charity. But unlike some other philanthropic groups, effective altruism organizations prioritize transparency. The Against Malaria Foundation, for example, shows each donor robust and updated data on when their donation is used and the distributor, the country and district of the installed mosquito net. It also keeps updated statistics on its overall distribution patterns and on the number of people that it is reaching. Of organizations that accept donations, the data indicate these charities are among the most reliable. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">OFTW is Brown’s first and only student organization for raising philanthropic donations that will hopefully increase students’ altruistic impact. As Brown students, we should think about the benefit to others that could come from putting aside a small amount of money. Of course, not everyone can afford this burden; but for those who can, I suggest considering taking the pledge. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">James Flynn '20 took the OFTW pledge, and the OFTW student group will be in the Ratty from 11:30am to 1pm to answer any questions about OFTW. He can be reached at james_flynn1@brown.edu. Please send responses to this opinion to letters@browndailyherald.com and op-eds to opinions@browndailyherald.com.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Calvelli &#039;19: Your voice is more than your vote. Keep talking.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The 2018 midterm elections happened about a month ago. Public engagement was high, but now that the results have all been tallied, it feels like political interest has died down on campus. This reflects a prevailing idea that a citizen’s job in a democracy starts and ends on Election Day. An Election Day announcement from the Swearer Center for Public Service embodies that thought. It read: “Your vote is your voice! The midterm elections are TODAY.”</p>
<p class="p2">Swearer should be promoting civic engagement, but they have a core point wrong: your vote is not your voice. This common refrain promotes the notion that casting a ballot is the only way citizens can meaningfully participate in democracy. That idea wrongfully delimits democratic engagement as a once-every-two-years endeavor and disempowers citizens in their everyday interactions. Citizens have their voices 365 days of the year. For democracy to flourish, everyone has to use those voices to speak out about what matters to them, both inside and outside the realm of formal politics.</p>
<p class="p2">“Your vote is your voice,” is probably meant to convey that voting is the most tangible form of civic participation. But if your vote is your voice, then citizens’ voices are little more than a faint whisper. In U.S. elections, the secret ballot system means that voting is not a publicly communicative act; state records show who voted, but not whom anyone voted for, meaning your vote doesn’t signal to anyone what you believe in. What’s more, your vote has functionally no impact on the outcome of any election, as the likelihood of a single vote being determinative is essentially zero, with <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/01/alaska-election-decided-by-one-vote-after-ballot-recount/">rare exceptions</a>. If your voice is your vote, and your vote neither publicly communicates anything nor affects who wins elections, then it would seem like you don’t have much of a voice.</p>
<p class="p2">Fortunately, though, if you realize you can use your voice on days other than election days, you’ll find seemingly unending opportunities to speak democratically. Just in the realm of formal politics, citizens can speak by contacting representatives, asking questions at debates, submitting public comment on regulations or canvassing voters for a campaign. All these examples of speech help elected officials remain accountable to their constituents’ opinions and remind citizens that their civic work can have practical impact on government.</p>
<p class="p2">But perhaps more important than voting and other formal channels of political speech — and definitely more overlooked — are the ways our everyday voices can contribute to a flourishing democratic culture. Politics, to me at least, is ultimately about improving others’ lives and fostering communities we can be proud of — not winning majority contests.</p>
<p class="p2">Within that broader democratic framework, voting is just one of many ways to make a civic impact. Beyond their votes, people can use their voices to deliberate over issues that matter to them, engage in constructive dialogue, forge friendships that sustain communities or elevate the voices and ideas of those left out of formal political institutions. This could happen at community meetings, on Facebook, in public forums, with neighbors across the street, around the Thanksgiving table, at work or while volunteering. The possibilities are endless. They are all facilitated by the simple capacity we have to speak to each other.</p>
<p class="p2">The importance of speech to democracy is illustrated by the First Amendment, which bans infringements on the “freedom of speech” — not the “freedom to vote on election days.” Free speech’s far-reaching ideal encompasses the ways we talk to each other and the environment in which we do. Citizens are legally empowered to speak their minds every day of the year, enabling an intentional exchange of ideas that can make politics a project of collective self-governance. Voting is private and results-oriented; speaking is public and, at its best, can promote understanding and conflict resolution.</p>
<p class="p2">However, the democratic ideal of free speech will falter if people equate their democratic responsibility to speak with their responsibility to vote. Voting is an important component of civic life and can make people invested in their communities. But voting does not exempt you from your responsibility to speak out more broadly. Your voice, as a tool perpetually at your disposal, is your best vehicle for expressing your values, convincing others to share your opinions and understanding your fellow citizens. When you speak in the public sphere, you enter an interpersonal dialogue and build a more intimate relationship with democracy, apart from the cacophony of legislative halls. Casting a secret ballot (and wearing a sticker announcing you did so) is a minor “speech” act compared to the myriad ways you can use your voice to affect and change the political culture in which you live.</p>
<p class="p2">Ultimately, your voice can be so much more than simply one count in a tabulation for an elected office. Come the next Election Day, you should cast your ballot as a way to express your candidate preference. But don’t wait until that Tuesday to make your voice heard. The more you use your voice to build civic bonds and connect with fellow citizens, the more you’ll realize how much more to democratic speech there is than voting.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In 2016, Ugur Cetintemel, a professor of computer science and the department’s chair, described in a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/04/12/enrollment-for-non-concentrator-cs-courses-soars/">Herald article</a> that one in five current undergraduates will have taken a computer science course before graduation. Students at Brown are becoming more interested in computer science courses because the skills they learn in these classes can be applied to various jobs, according to a 2017 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/14/draft-wang-cs-most-popular-concentration/">Herald article</a>. Within elite research universities, the percentage of students pursuing humanities degrees has dropped from 17 percent to 11 percent in the past decade. Most academics <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/colleges-studying-humanities-promotion/574621/">attribute this</a> major shift to the lingering effects of the Great Recession. Many students value financial stability, and sometimes that does affect the path they choose when it comes to their concentrations. The most recent <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/14/fall-2018-herald-poll-results/">Herald poll</a> found that 40.4 percent of Brown students rank salary as one of their top two considerations when choosing a career. While it is a valid concern to have some plan for financial stability in the future, students should not allow this to deter them from studying the humanities if that’s their interest. Even as a computer science concentrator, I have found that some of the best classes I have taken have been in the humanities, learning about how ideas have evolved and developed over time to inspire social changes.</p>
<p class="p2">One of the distinctive aspects of Brown is the open curriculum, which allows students the freedom to develop their own “core classes.” And while Brown provides students with the freedom to craft an education within their interests, the open curriculum gives students the opportunity to be open to ideas, people and perspectives that they might not otherwise have discovered. By taking a humanities course or concentrating in a humanities degree, students not only learn how to be informed and critical citizens, but they also develop communication and writing skills, which are vital for many jobs.</p>
<p class="p2">There are also many Brown alums whose background in the humanities helped them develop businesses and pursue innovative ideas. For instance, after graduating with American History and American Studies degrees, respectively, <a href="https://www.castaneapartners.com/team-member/tom-first/">Tom First</a> ’89 and Tom Scott ’89 decided they wanted to stay in Nantucket, M.A. and work odd jobs like shucking scallops and shampooing dogs to pay for rent. For a Nantucket cooking contest, First decided to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/17/business/sailing-rising-tide-juice-almost-accidental-success-nantucket-nectars.html">enter on a whim</a> by trying to recreate a peach drink he had in Spain and went on to win the contest. After that, though neither of them took a business course at Brown and both failed an accounting course, they decided to start selling the juice off of Scott’s boat. They named their business Nantucket Nectars. Despite some initial business mistakes, the company made $15 million in sales in 1995. They eventually decided to <a href="https://serendipitysocial.com/tom-scotts-next-big-idea-2/">sell a major portion</a> of the company to Ocean Spray in 1997 for $70 million.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Currently, First works with a private equity firm that invests in inventive consumer brands and Scott focuses his time on<a href="http://nantucketfilmfestival.org/blog/2016/6/13/5-questions-withtom-scott-co-found-of-the-nantucket-project"> the Nantucket Project</a>, a conference held on Nantucket Harbor that brings prominent thinkers together in conversation on a variety of issues. In frequent guest lectures in ENGN 0090: “Management of Industrial and Nonprofit Organizations,” First and Scott underscore the role that studying the humanities played in helping them understand how to relate to people and create an impactful business.</p>
<p class="p2">First and Scott aren’t the only Brown alums whose humanities degrees led them to an unexpected career in a new niche. Molly Rosen Guy ’99 graduated with a humanities degree but initially faced trouble in her writing career. She sold a book to Grove Press, but her book contract <a href="https://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/articles/2016-01-06/weddings-without-drama">eventually dissolved</a> after she saw how many edits it required. While she was working at a beauty copywriting job that she hated, Guy was planning a wedding and couldn’t find the small, edgy boutique she imagined would be in New York. So, without any experience in business or fashion, she decided to create her own boutique, Stone Fox Bride. This boutique has been a success for many years. Now, she is the <a href="http://www.mollyrosenguy.com/bio/">creative director</a> of Stone Fox Bride, the contributing editor of Vogue.com and the executive weddings editor at Domino, an American home magazine.</p>
<p class="p2">These Brown alums gained valuable skills from their humanities degree that allowed them to be successful on their own terms later in life. This does not even count the hundreds of humanities graduates annually who go into fields like law, government and public service. Since the humanities focuses on the study of human society and culture, people who study these fields are able to develop interpersonal and writing skills. Even though these Brown alums did not initially have any background in the new fields that they ended up pursuing, they were able to use their abilities to understand and relate to their audiences to sell their innovative ideas. Their stories highlight how humanities degrees can offer intangible value to careers and encourage individuals to take unexpected risks. As STEM fields become more and more popular, it is important not to lose sight of the value that these interpersonal skills provide.</p>
<p class="p2">Though expected salary and financial security are important considerations, undergraduate students should not let the fear of a nontraditional career path deter them from their passion in the humanities. It may be a good idea to take a couple classes in some STEM fields to learn some tangible skills in the job market; but humanities courses challenge students to think creatively and critically about the world we live in. Whether it’s a philosophy course that forces students to ask ethical questions or a history course that allows them to understand the past, humanities courses push students to gain knowledge of the human experience. STEM courses will certainly teach students to innovate, but humanities will teach them how to use that knowledge to make a meaningful impact in their careers and beyond.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">My favorite quote about American elections is from political scientist Alexis De Tocqueville, who in 1835 described our process of electing a president as “a time of national crisis. As the election draws near, intrigues intensify and agitation increases and spreads. The citizens divide into several camps, each behind its candidate. A fever grips the entire nation.” In today’s era, we often wonder how our government has become so bitterly polarized. But we forget that elections throughout our history have proven that our system lends itself perfectly to producing bitter divisions that only catastrophes have the power to bridge.</p>
<p class="p2">In fact, crisis response is in large part what makes the presidency such an attractive institution for so many Americans. We value our presidents most when they perform their most obvious role, which is — you guessed it — the crisis manager. Whether it was the American Civil War, the Great Depression or 9/11, presidents are always most popular when they fight for us in times of need or rally the country against a common threat. This narrative of bravely fighting back against the difficulties facing us all is an incredibly comforting one; but the degree of executive autonomy necessary to enable this ability can introduce unnecessary risk into the governing process, and it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite the seemingly critical role it plays in American government, the presidency was by no means designed by the founders of our nation to be as central or as powerful as it became. There exists today a certain mythology around the presidency that has only developed as executive power has increased over time; in fact, the specifics of the structure of the executive branch were deferred until very late in the constitutional convention because the position of the executive was conceived by most as one voted on by Congress, and without the powers to declare war, make treaties or appoint judges. In the end, many of the final powers were approved because of the confidence that, as wielded by George Washington, they would pose no threat to the union.</p>
<p class="p2">But as both the powers and responsibilities of the U.S. president have increased dramatically over time, the ripples of any given president’s reactions have morphed into global waves. The level of influence the president wields was by no means foreseen by the American public. The position that we would recognize today is not only an exaggerated form of the constitutional mandate, but one whose few enumerated powers were likely passed because the majority of the signers were too tired after months of debate to resist. Many would argue that the value of the presidency today lies in its ability to effect change directly and focus national political will, but while it is comforting and marginally more efficient to have a “captain of the ship” responsible for making tough decisions, the indispensability of the president becomes less obvious when you dig a little deeper. It certainly does not justify the risks posed by a rogue president ever gaining office.</p>
<p class="p2">President Trump has proven a lot of things about America: a lot of things we’d rather not admit are true, like the ease with which legislative progress can be completely reversed. Perhaps more importantly, however, he has proven that the instability presented by a bad president is far greater than the potential benefit of a good one. As a proximate representative of the American people, the president’s mere words can at best maintain the dignity of the office, but at worst can damage the international enforceability of human rights norms, embolden strongmen in their power grabs and political assassinations and isolate the American economy in an increasingly interconnected world. The complexity of the modern United States and the now-global effects of the slightest decisions make the risk of unintended consequences far greater than the potential benefit of a quick reaction.</p>
<p class="p2">Regardless, maybe it’s time we realize the office of the president puts too much at stake for the slim benefits it offers in return. Whatever comfort is provided to voters by having a champion in a time of need is not hard to outweigh; as it stands, the options are a potentially more swift response to crises and threats on the one hand, but the loss of international credibility and severe damage to valuable institutions on the other. The viability (not to mention desirability) of a weaker executive institution is apparent: Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and George Mason, for example, supported an executive council instead of a single president. Such a body, much like the modern cabinet — or those of countries like Switzerland, which is governed by a council of ministers — would consist of experts in their departments who would have independence to create policy in their areas of knowledge but would also provide a check on each others’ capacity to make unfounded political claims, spend taxpayer dollars on personal benefits or blatantly obstruct federal investigations. It is clearer than ever that we cannot reasonably expect, like the founders did, that our office of the president as we know it will put the needs of the nation before personal or partisan gain when we need it to.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you are a STEM concentrator at Brown, research is key. The sooner an undergraduate gets into research, the better and more competitive their resume will be. To students either deciding sophomore spring they want to concentrate in STEM without any prior research experience, or students who come from disadvantaged educational backgrounds and were not exposed to research early in their careers, peers coming to Brown with previous research experience can intimidate or disadvantage them. This discrepancy puts students on an uneven playing field for the internship and job markets, or the Brown research community. A course encouraging students to develop their own research projects and gain the hands-on research skills they’ll need in their future careers would help rectify the uneven playing field between students with prior experience and students without. Though such courses exist for a larger number of upper-level STEM classes, for example BIOL 1870: “Techniques and Clinical Applications in Pathobiology,” they need to be available earlier on for students who are beginning their STEM careers at a seeming disadvantage.</p>
<p class="p2">The issue of getting new college graduates, or even current students, jobs or opportunities in STEM industries without prior experience is slowly growing. Quickly, more and more undergraduates are doing research in their short time during college. According to a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2007/07/importance-undergraduate-research">2007 study by the National Science Foundation</a>, 72 percent of chemistry students and 74 percent of environmental science students applying for graduate schools had research experience. Now, having undergraduate research experience is crucial, and many of these research experiences, such as fellowships and associate positions, prefer candidates with prior experience in research.</p>
<p class="p2">Just as the job market is advancing toward favoring applicants with a basic university degree as the standard amount of education and practice, applicants with previous research experience and/or publications are more likely to be favored than those with no research experience at all ­— even for entry-level jobs. According to a <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/survey-61-of-entry-level-jobs-require-3-years-of-experience">study done by TalentWorks</a>, 61 percent of entry-level jobs required at least three years of experience. But students need jobs and internships for experience. These two facts seem at odds with each other because they are; the more competitive the job market, the more likely that applicants teeming with an eagerness to learn but possessing a scant resume will slip through the cracks.</p>
<p class="p2">There are already ways Brown gives students a fair chance at succeeding through structured courses introducing concepts that may not have been taught to students in high school. These are classes that bring students from varying backgrounds up to speed: Think MATH 0090: “Introductory Calculus” and other introductory courses that are essential to bridge the gaps from a multitude of high school educations. This puts everyone on a relatively even playing field, ensuring students without the proper background can get the knowledge they need to succeed before pursuing their respective paths. These classes, as well as others, were crucial for students like me who did not realize they were interested in STEM until either very late in high school or early on in college. Why would we not have a similar system for students oriented toward skills in research?</p>
<p class="p2">A course that introduces the basic procedures any lab requires will properly prepare us for research jobs we apply to and positions we may hold during the academic year with faculty, ensuring we are properly prepared to begin cutting-edge research without the need for extensive training on the job. And if not applicable during the school year, this will better prepare students for summer positions where the application process is known to be lengthy and especially competitive for students with no prior lab experience or knowledge of procedures. A course introducing research and encouraging students to think critically would give those without a research background a fighting chance during the application process, especially if they are able to take charge of their own research projects or produce a thesis at the end of it.</p>
<p class="p2">Previous experience or a fluffy resume is obviously not a surefire way to land the research position of your dreams, but having relevant experience is always helpful. Students can be discouraged when a research listing says “no previous experience required, but preferred,” and they are often passed over. Of course, reaching out to faculty directly and getting involved in a specific project is always an option, but students can only benefit from having experience as soon as possible. A course at Brown bridging the gap between students with and without research experience could be the first step toward equalizing students who come from different backgrounds and making them more competitive for research jobs and graduate programs.</p>

		<title>Calvelli &#039;19: A recipe for success in college</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">First, brown one diced onion in butter in a large pot. Next, add about two pounds of chopped carrots, along with a tablespoon or two of minced ginger and a tablespoon of chopped fresh herbs such as parsley, tarragon or lemongrass. Saute until the onions are soft and the carrots are starting to pick up a hint of sweetness. Add just enough water or light vegetable stock to cover (and no more!), throw in a hearty palmful of salt and black pepper, then bring to a boil; reduce to a simmer until the carrots are fully cooked. Puree the soup (immersion blender or regular blender — whatever crumbles your cookie), stir in about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar or lemon juice and adjust seasoning. Serve garnished with fresh herb salsa, and voila — you have yourself a smooth carrot-ginger soup.</p>
<p class="p2">Simple to prepare, pretty healthy, loaded with micronutrients and totally doable for a college student on a busy schedule and a tight budget. This right here is your recipe for success.</p>
<p class="p2">I hope you didn’t think this article was going to be a “recipe” in the sense of steps you can take to succeed in college. This is literally a recipe for carrot soup. Fortunately, though, this soup recipe yields benefits beyond flavor and nourishment; it illustrates how cooking — or, more broadly, doing what you love outside the classroom — is integral to getting the most out of your higher education experience.</p>
<p class="p2">College, despite all the freedom it’s said to provide, can be an all-consuming endeavor. With no formal separation between work and life (we live where we work and vice versa!), it’s easy to feel like the endless pages of reading and perpetual problem sets can (or should) fill every waking hour. To me, when schoolwork — or anything else, for that matter — becomes so ubiquitous, my productivity suffers, and, more importantly, the work becomes less enjoyable. Tasks that hang over your head tend not to fill you with enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="p2">That’s why I think, banal as it may sound, that it’s crucial to continually engage in a hobby that takes you away from schoolwork. Some people might see this idea of me-time as a way to mitigate the stresses of college and take breaks to enjoy ourselves. However, I see it differently. To me, a major goal of the outside activity isn’t to distract from school, but rather to infuse it with more purpose and enjoyment. Work and play here are complementary. I’ve found that when I can derive meaning from multiple facets of my life, I feel less distraught when one of those facets temporarily seems like a burden. Boring day of seminar? At least I had a good workout. Undercooked pie crust? At least I got to learn about bird mating in class. Having those outlets helps me remember that schoolwork doesn’t need to consume my life; I can dislike a problem set without hating the entire academy, and the worth of my time here is greater than my grade on an essay.</p>
<p class="p2">Finding activities that give you those reminders is unfortunately easier said than done. That’s why, to get back to the point of this article (soup), I’m here to suggest that cooking is the best one. Of course, anything that gives you meaning and helps keep work in its rightfully limited space is great, but I think cooking has the most universal potential.</p>
<p class="p2">For one, cooking (or, at least, eating) is a necessary task. If you can imbue fun into your everyday tasks, you’ll be well positioned for a healthy daily perspective on life. It’s empowering to take something — meal prep — that can seem like a chore, and use it instead to build skills that are both useful and sources of pride. Learning to cook while you’re in college helps in life beyond your undergraduate years, too. What better time, with our unstructured schedules, to practice this skill that will make you a more attractive partner, a better dinner-party host or a praiseworthy parent?</p>
<p class="p2">Cooking also fosters traits helpful in college and in life. The process of making meals from scratch requires thoughtfulness and creativity. It demands that you take the time to consider why you’re doing what you’re doing. It also shows how rewarding it is to refine your work until it’s exactly the way you want. Failing in the kitchen is a low-stress way to see how mistakes are opportunities for growth. (Burned the crust on your bread? Sounds like French toast, not failure!) And for all the humanities people out there, the kitchen can be a simple introduction to STEM, teaching the practical value of understanding physics and chemistry by applying it to the glorious act of eating.</p>
<p class="p2">Last but not least, cooking is an excellent way to forge community. From time immemorial, humans have come together over food, whether around a fire, in a mead hall or at a bistro. In college, it’s easy to rush for a quick coffee to catch up or to replace social interactions with doing work together. Cooking and sitting down for a meal with friends new and old inspires you to slow down, to focus on your food and your friendship; sharing the experience of eating is a way of sharing the experience of life. College is the last time we’ll be surrounded by this many potential friends, so I see any opportunity to bring people together as one worth taking — especially when it can involve a Balkan cucumber salad or maple-walnut pie.</p>
<p class="p2">So, if you feel like your work has become your life and you need a new outlet, consider putting down your pencil, picking up a chef’s knife and getting to work chopping carrots. Hopefully, this carrot-ginger soup will inspire you, as it did me, to see how much cooking adds to the college experience. But even if it doesn’t, and you still see cooking as a bore, making the soup will still have been worth it. Why? Because now you have soup you can eat whenever you want. And there’s not much better than that.</p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last semester, Brown students arrived to find that easy-to-access <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/29/scooter-regulations-stress-access-affordability/">e-scooters</a> and <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/19/bike-share-program-comes-providence/">bicycles</a> had sprouted up like weeds in the cracks of campus sidewalks. New app-based programs meant that students who couldn’t bring their own rides to campus suddenly had more transportation options. And if the often-empty bike docks on Thayer Street don’t provide enough proof, an hour spent observing students around campus makes it impossible to deny how many are enjoying the ease of biking or scootering from class to class.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though I haven’t partaken in the experience myself, I appreciate the convenience and the health benefits offered by these new options. But I’m also concerned about how often I see riders violating basic traffic laws. As new options make it easier for more students to take to the road on wheels, it’s vital to remember that they too are responsible for keeping the roads safe. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’ll admit: I don’t have the data to prove this is a real problem. These apps are too new for any official studies on their riders’ behavior. But the number of times last semester that I saw a backpack-wearing biker atop one of JUMP’s unmistakable scarlet mounts just blow through a stop sign? It was more than once, to put it mildly. And I’m not talking about people pulling “Idaho stops,” or treating stop signs as yield signs as permitted in Idaho; I mean cyclists who don’t even slow down as they approach an intersection. According to the <a href="https://ribike.org/bikelaws">Rhode Island Bicycle Coalition</a>, “Rhode Island does not provide any modifications (for bicycles and scooters) to the requirement to come to a complete stop when directed to stop by traffic control devices.” Students who don’t stop, then, are in violation of the law, providing officers from the Department of Public Safety or the</span><span class="s2"> Providence Police Department a cause to pull them over and potentially leading to traumatic encounters for students. But even without the threat of legal repercussions, do I really have to detail the reasons that you shouldn’t run a stop sign? Students who do so endanger themselves, those walking or riding on the sidewalks and people driving in the streets. Though the Idaho stop is, arguably, sometimes safer than coming to a full stop (though still not legal), there is no justification for blasting through the signs like the fires of hell will catch up to you if you’re two seconds late to your philosophy seminar.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s also the matter of parking the scooters and bikes. With e-scooters, you’re <a href="http://www.providenceri.gov/planning/e-scooter-share-pilot-program/">legally required</a> to “leave at least a four-foot path for pedestrians to get by.” People who use wheelchairs or mobility devices have an even more urgent need for that space — while it’s easy enough for an able-bodied pedestrian to roll their eyes and step over an improperly-parked vehicle, that isn’t an option for everyone. I know the narrow Providence sidewalks and the walkways on campus make it difficult to achieve that mandated four-foot berth, but c’mon, it’s not that hard to make sure that you leave your scooter or bike parked parallel to a path, rather than jutting out at an angle and inconveniencing everyone who has to go by.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The reasons for obeying traffic laws or parking regulations go beyond safety and accessibility. As students, we need to respect the fact that we’re part of the larger Providence community. One aspect of this is not acting as though we’re entitled to violate the rules of the road. If we want to be good neighbors, we have to be respectful of others who are driving, walking or otherwise at risk of being mowed over by zooming bicycles.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a wise man once said, “with great power comes great responsibility.” JUMP, Lime and other vendors of e-vehicles have conveniently and affordably provided power to anyone who wants it. Now, it’s time to make sure that students uphold our end of the bargain by obeying stop signs, refraining from obstructing sidewalks with parked vehicles and generally being courteous with our wheels.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the past few weeks, disturbing tales of sexist and racist harassment at academic conferences have been making headlines. Women scholars have been belittled at the American Historical Association annual <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/10/02/american-historical-association-report-reveals-harassment-and-demeaning-behavior-its" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meeting</a>, and black scholars have been asked to prove that they belong at the joint meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America and the Society for <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/My-MeritMy-Blackness/245462/#.XDkAQIW4OLM.twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Classical Studies</a>. As a result of this, many scholars have written responses to these <a href="https://classicalstudies.org/scs-blog/sarah-bond/blog-roundup-reports-reactions-and-reflections-after-scs-annual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacks</a> while some victims of harassment have chosen to leave <a href="https://twitter.com/Libertinopatren/status/1081584636088610816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a> and still other groups have decided not to return to the conferences altogether. Given the prevalence of <a href="https://www.brown.edu/offices/events/planning-resources/policies-and-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harassment</a> that historically marginalized attendees face at such gatherings, organizing bodies can and must do more to protect and empower these participants.</p>
<p class="p2">As integral parts of academia, conferences should be safe spaces for attendees, and hosting organizations must work to prevent harassment. Adopting a clear anti-harassment policy is one method to work toward this goal. Such a policy should outline specific behaviors that are prohibited but, more importantly, should define procedures for reporting behavior and holding attendees accountable. Moreover, it should be easy to find these anti-harassment policies — they should be advertised widely and freely to ensure that participants know what to do in the event of any incidents. As students attending such conferences, we should demand that hosting organizations adopt and publicize anti-harassment policies. As members of a university that hosts conferences, we need to require similar policies for organizations that host events in our space.</p>
<p class="p2">Conferences are often incredibly fun and productive. They provide environments to meet new people, learn new topics and explore new ideas. They help us to hone skills in crafting arguments, public speaking and perfectly illustrating arguments through internet memes. Feedback from conference presentations helps to further refine ideas and often leads to publications or other research opportunities. Conferences, then, can be excellent places to inspire students and academics. Additionally, conferences can provide platforms for voices that are traditionally marginalized in academia, centering ideas and empowering researchers that academia has often left behind.</p>
<p class="p2">But conferences are not always so intellectually pure or successful. The institutionalized role that such gatherings play in academia has created a number of issues. Presenting at conferences is as much a part of establishing academic credentials as publishing and may even be preferable in some fast-paced fields that rely on quick turnaround and rapid improvements. As such, students are expected to attend to build up their resume and engage in active conversations within their field of research. In addition, large academic conferences provide the perfect setting for job interviews and professional recruitment because employers assume that qualified applicants will attend these conferences. To further a career in academia, and often with the government and private companies, attending these meetings is of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="p2">Conferences have shown themselves to be breeding grounds for harassment, as the incidents at the annual conferences of the AIA and SCS and AHA in the past few weeks have demonstrated. Participants, especially women and people of color, experienced harassment at these events that the field and job market require them to attend. They were belittled and talked down to by their colleagues and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>had the validity of their participation questioned. In these situations, conferences have worked not to provide platforms for marginalized voices but to actively silence them. While there’s something to be said for reconsidering the role that conferences play in academia, our immediate priority should be making conferences safe for historically marginalized participants.</p>
<p class="p2">To confront this issue, we have to ensure that conferences have anti-harassment policies that are both broadly publicized and actively enforced. Ramifications for harassing behavior as well as the process for reporting such behavior should be outlined clearly. Universities like Brown that host numerous conferences both large and small should consider establishing an anti-harassment policy as a prerequisite for use of space and materials. For instance, the University Event and Conference Services <a href="https://www.brown.edu/offices/events/planning-resources/step-step-planning-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> outlines the steps for planning an event and exhorts the planner to “Make Your Event Safe &amp; Accessible.” Yet the instructions for ensuring safety nowhere specify the need to establish and enforce an anti-harassment policy. Under “University Policies,” the site lists event disruption protocols and restates the University’s Diversity and Inclusion stance, but once again fails to describe a policy specifically against harassment.</p>
<p class="p2">I don’t think that the University Event and Conference Services are responsible for the actions of participants at conferences that they support, nor do I think that anti-harassment policies will protect everyone from the vitriol of ill-informed or mean-spirited attendees. I do, however, think that they can require groups to adopt anti-harassment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>policies that can help protect these participants, working to empower and uplift marginalized voices. If a small change like requiring anti-harassment policies can provide even a modicum of protection for conference attendees, we need to exhort our community to make it happen.</p>

		<title>Anthony &#039;22: Unpacking the Los Angeles teachers’ strike</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Los Angeles teachers’ strike ended Tuesday night after six days of picketing. Teachers and other educators returned Wednesday to classrooms having successfully earned from the district smaller class sizes, a six-percent raise and more counselors, librarians and nurses. As a daughter of a school psychologist who was on strike and a student who spent 13 years in public schools, I wholeheartedly support the union of United Teachers Los Angeles and the teachers’ strike. The agreement on Tuesday is a step in the right direction for the future of the district and education policy as a whole. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to participate in the strike firsthand, as this experience solidified my solidarity with the educators of the Los Angeles Unified School District.</p>
<p class="p2">Teachers, substitutes, counselors, librarians, nurses and psychologists began to strike last Monday at every LAUSD school site, according to UTLA. My mom and I woke up at 6 a.m. to unusual Southern California pouring rain, so it took special determination to step outdoors. We drove down to the sidewalk outside of one of the two schools where she works. There, we picketed for two hours outside the gates of the school, chanting “U - T - L - A” and holding signs that read “On Strike for Our Students.” After the morning picket line, over 50,000 people flooded the streets of Downtown Los Angeles in a march to the district headquarters. The crowd bustled with energy, a sea of umbrellas and rain ponchos set to a roar of drumbeats and chants. Students, community members and other labor unions such as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters were present in support of the rally. This process continued in a similar fashion all of last week. Strike participants did not enter schools for six days, forgoing their pay in the process. The volume of the <a href="http://utla.net/news/strike-wrap-day-1">strike</a> — 30,000 participating educators<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— should be the first indication of its importance.</p>
<p class="p2">Substitutes from other districts and non-union district workers supervised students who attended schools during the strike — but not all of them showed up. LAUSD loses money from the state for each student absence, so UTLA encouraged students and parents to join their teachers on the picket line. Elsewhere in the city, support for the movement swelled: Several museums around the city offered free admission to students not attending school in a demonstration of solidarity.</p>
<p class="p2">The teacher’s strike in Los Angeles is both historic and indicative of a national trend. UTLA hasn’t gone on strike in thirty years. In fact, while we were picketing Monday, a former teacher who took part in the 1989 strike came out and offered words of support to the teachers. As the second largest district in the nation, LAUSD is a flashpoint into the broader educational labor movement, with teachers nationwide paying rapt attention to the strike. Denver teachers voted Wednesday to begin a strike, with teachers in Oakland set to vote as well. Earlier this school year, teachers across West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona also went on massive strikes.</p>
<p class="p2">These movements show a shift in the national conversation surrounding public education, a long-neglected issue in the country. Current Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is a champion of school choice, which pulls funding out of public education and into private and charter schools. Rather than divert funding from public schools, lawmakers need to reinvest in the current public system. The benefits from increased funding are manifold: smaller class sizes, higher wages and an expansion in support staff.</p>
<p class="p2">Many students at Brown attended private or charter schools and are perhaps unaware of the realities that regular public schools and their students face. California is 41st in the nation in per-student spending on education; LAUSD students are an unfortunate example of those affected by this lack of investment. The district serves a diverse population of over 600,000 students across more than 1,000 schools in neighborhoods of all types. Many teachers’ signs at the rally reiterated the idea that the teachers are on strike for their students and are spending valuable time away from the classroom out of necessity.</p>
<p class="p2">The teachers’ strike asked for this investment in public education from the district and was largely successful in achieving its demands. Before striking, most schools only had a nurse on site one day per week. Now, the district is hiring 300 additional nurses to ensure that each school has a nurse. Furthermore, 77 more counselors will be hired over the next few years.</p>
<p class="p2">However, not everyone is satisfied with the deal: The priorities of school psychologists were relegated to the sideline. The 6 percent raise is lower than the requested 6.5 percent, and the raise is long overdue — especially in a city as expensive to live in as Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="p2">Teachers should be considered the premier authority on education policy because of their experience in the classroom. Lived experience has always been valued in activist circles, and teachers live out the manifestation of education policies every day. Never a priority in America, educators have been ignored and sidelined for years. Now, with the successful strike in Los Angeles, we have a unique and groundbreaking example of the power of teachers to effect change. The union has been successful in achieving its primary goals. This is the beginning of several important conversations regarding public education, and I hope to see public educators across the nation achieve similar victories.</p>

		<title>Sachan &#039;22: How can the NFL improve the Pro Bowl?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The National Football League postseason is the highlight of the year for football enthusiasts. The best teams in the league play tough playoff football. Every game is an elimination game, and each week the matchups get more exciting right up until the Super Bowl. Except for one misstep. Somewhere in the middle is something called the Pro Bowl: a middling attempt at an all-star game that the NFL has to change.</p>
<p class="p2">The Pro Bowl has problems. Players don’t want to get hurt, and fans don’t want to see a game where nobody, including the players, cares. It’s not the players’ fault. Football is a dangerous sport where one injury could jeopardize an athlete’s future to play and earn lucrative contracts. Because of this, a lot of players decline to show up. The NFL then scrambles to find replacement players (remember when Tyrod Taylor was in the Pro Bowl?) until they can put together a full roster. Beyond the problem of players declining to show up, the Pro Bowl selection process is flawed. Fans make up one-third of the votes on who plays; while I understand why the NFL would want fans to be more involved in the game, Pro Bowl nominations have serious implications, since players often receive bonuses if they are invited to the Pro Bowl. Beyond that, the number of Pro Bowl invitations a player receives is frequently referenced as a sign of his greatness. Fans are highly biased and tend to pick the players who play for their favorite teams, not the best players. The current process leaves players feeling commercialized and fans just wanting to fast-forward to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p class="p2">So should the NFL scrap the Pro Bowl? Definitely not. All-star games are magical. There’s something to be said for bringing together the best players in the world. Team rivalries disappear, and all of these playmakers can show off their skills.</p>
<p class="p2">From a pragmatic perspective, it also doesn’t make sense to get rid of the Pro Bowl. The Pro Bowl makes the NFL a lot of money. Beyond that, the two-week gap before the Super Bowl allows the league to coordinate logistics and gives Super Bowl teams time for injured players to recover, making the game more competitive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the Pro Bowl is here to stay, the question becomes: How can the NFL make it better?</p>
<p class="p2">There are a lot of directions the NFL can take the game. First of all, Pro Bowl selections are important, both to players’ salaries and their legacy, so let’s see that reflected in the selection process. There should be a committee of independently affiliated sportswriters selecting Pro Bowl nominees, like the much more reputable All-Pro and Hall of Fame selections. That would help avoid the Pro Bowl snubs that we see year after year.</p>
<p class="p2">Another simple improvement would be focusing more on the smaller competitions throughout the week, such as the Gridiron Gauntlet and Dodgeball. The skills competition is my favorite part of the Pro Bowl; it’s one of the only opportunities for fans to watch players compete without pads and helmets. It helps us see them as people and not as football players. Therefore, there should also be more events for every position. Let’s get the special teams’ players involved. Let’s see circus catch competitions for wide receivers. Let’s see offensive linemen compete in sack races. Let’s see some flag football with wide receivers playing quarterback and vice versa. The NFL needs to get more creative to design games that showcase the players’ superhuman athletic abilities. The more fun the NFL can introduce into the Pro Bowl, the more fans and players will appreciate it.</p>
<p class="p2">As for the actual game, the NFL is already going in the right direction. They’re trying to make the Pro Bowl faster by reducing the time between plays from the typical 40 seconds to 35 seconds. Other changes include allowing coaches to communicate with multiple players on offense and defense during a play, compared to only talking to the quarterback or middle linebacker in a usual NFL game. This should make the game much more dynamic.</p>
<p class="p2">While some sportswriters want to raise the stakes by giving $250,000 to the winning team, I believe<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that a payout is against the nature of the Pro Bowl. No player should get injured during the Pro Bowl, and increasing the prize money would definitely incentivize hitting harder and risking injury. While I love the big hits just as much as any other fan, what does it say about the game if we want to see players hit each other more than we want to see safe, competitive play? In this sense, the NFL faces an impasse. At the highest levels, there is no way to guarantee safety, and in trying to do so, we lose some essence of the game. That’s why it can be viewed as a good thing that players are cognizant of their long-term health and playing future. A better idea to make the game more exciting is changing the playbook to bring in more college trick plays. I want to see more defensive players on offense. I want to see more wacky formations. Fans want to see all of the fun play designs that teams are too afraid to bring out in the regular season.</p>
<p class="p2">Additionally, the fundamental flaw with the AFC vs NFC format is that not enough people identify with such large conferences. Each division could have its own seven-person team, similar to how the NHL All-Star game functions. By dividing the teams based on smaller divisions such as the NFC East or AFC North, fans will be much more invested in their division’s success and there would be an actual storyline. This wouldn’t take away from any of the competitiveness of the game.</p>
<p class="p2">I love the idea of an all-star game, and for so many reasons the league has to keep it. There are a lot of directions the NFL could go with the Pro Bowl, but the only wrong move would be changing nothing at all.</p>

		<title>Miller &#039;19: Toward more informed and honest recycling</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2019/01/29/column-miller-environmental-sustainability/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Corporations have been known to capitalize on environmental sustainability to increase customer favor without clearly outlining the impact of their efforts. This should be no surprise: these companies pay to promote their business, not cure the ills of the world. Thus, their clarion call to consumers — a tantara of half truths — makes consumers believe they have made a positive choice. Thus, the recycling bin has become an all-magic chimera to throw in anything made of plastic, foil or paper, absolving consumers and corporations of their environmental impacts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For example, the massively popular conglomerate Starbucks announced that by 2020 it would replace its plastic straws with “Nitro lids.” Straws can rarely be recycled due to their composition and small size; the new lid, though it has more plastic, is made of a commonly recycled material. Many consumers hailed Starbucks’ decision, and with this imprimatur came an immediately demonstrable financial impact — a significant jump in the price of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6503605c-8386-11e8-a29d-73e3d454535d">Starbucks’ stock</a>. Yet, we should not let Starbucks (or ourselves) off the hook. On our end, these lids must be recycled in order to reduce the amount of plastic in landfills, so please do so. For Starbucks, they still need to address a much larger problem for which a solution has not yet been found — the six-billion cardboard cups lined with plastic deposited in landfills each year. Even if a customer recycles a Starbucks cup, many recycling centers are ill-equipped to process the materials, and these cups actually contaminate the rest of the load. Starbucks should acknowledge the shortcomings of recycling, research the guides of the nearby recycling plants and post customized signs informing consumers of the materials that can be recycled in the area. This honest and transparent version of sustainability benefits the planet and its consumers much more than a blanket claim of alleviating environmental pollution.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But while its name is easily recognizable to us, Starbucks is only a microcosm of a global problem. One of the most significant environmental concerns is that some materials widely accepted as recyclable are in fact not. And misplacement of materials in recycling facilities has serious negative consequences. The successful and complete recycling of materials largely depends on the facility to which it is being sent ­— items and requirements drastically vary. For instance, plastic bags cannot be recycled unless sent to specialized facilities. In addition, China, to which many states export their recycling, recently tightened its rules about what it would no longer accept, including all post-consumer plastic and mixed paper. China also requires that recycled material only be 0.5 percent impure; batches that do not meet this standard are sent to the landfill.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This environmental issue and others manifest themselves far closer to home. Brown has prided itself on creating an environmentally-friendly campus. Brown students can no longer buy on-campus single-use plastic water bottles, sip from plastic straws or find a trash can without an adjoining recycling bin. Businesses that join the Thayer Street enclave have begun to accommodate their clientele’s sustainable bent. Yet, lackadaisical attitudes continue to exist on Brown’s campus. Too often, Brown students engage in “aspirational recycling,” by recycling items in hope that they can and will be recycled, or easily filtered out if they cannot be. Moreover, companies obfuscate the extent to which recycling can occur, leading to further contamination. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One example on Thayer Street is by Chloe. by Chloe sells exclusively vegan food with a myriad of meat substitutes, which positively impacts the environment because meat consumption leaves a huge carbon footprint. by Chloe has been rewarded with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/exclusive-by-chloe-the-vegan-shake-shack-receives-31-million-investment-to-expand-globally-2018-04-05-8882611">$31 million</a> in funding from investors to expand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, by Chloe’s local recycling system could improve to the paradigm set by its sustainable food choices. Commendably, the restaurant has chosen recyclable service material. Now, if only it would specify what can be recycled. Materials containing food scraps cannot be recycled and, similar to coffee cups, can contaminate an entire load. by Chloe does not alert its customers of this fact and instead allows them to incorrectly recycle. Companies on and off of Thayer Street must do more to guide consumers in order to claim the profit from sustainability.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am certainly not disparaging companies who have committed themselves to becoming more environmentally friendly. I embrace any and all steps toward helping our environment. However, I wish to encourage best practices from companies who attempt to capitalize on sustainability and to exhort them to deliver real and lasting environmental improvement. Superficial benefits, which only complicate the disposal chain, too often go in the other direction. It is of limited or no value to lead consumers to believe they have “done their good deed” and thereafter become complacent or blind to instances of environmental degradation caused by their own choices. Ignoring basic rules of recycling in order to claim sustainability can be counterproductive. Companies must be more knowledgeable, and thereafter more open and honest about what can be recycled, if they really wish to promote sustainability. But it is everyone’s responsibility to be committed to protecting the environment. For consumers, I follow a piece of somewhat illogical advice — when in doubt, throw it out.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you’ve been a Brown student for any period of time, you’ve probably heard about sin awareness day. For most of us, this inevitable part of the semester boils down to a few days each year when everyone’s Snapchat stories are full of videos of a couple guys yelling indistinguishably atop a box outside Faunce arch. Sometimes they pass out papers to the more unsuspecting students, but for the most part they are relatively easy to ignore. These disorganized, but undeniably motivated individuals can represent anything from a minor nuisance to a meaningful (or at the very least, interesting) interaction. Thankfully, which one of those it becomes more or less falls on you — both when interacting with sin awareness day speakers and any member of the community on College Hill.</p>
<p class="p2">Over the summer I worked at the CareerLAB, and as such got a chance to walk past Jose — the guy who sells various handmade goods by the bookstore — on a regular basis. During the semester, not only am I generally more in a hurry, but he is also usually more occupied. The summer presented a bit of a perfect storm of boredom for both him and me, and we wound up talking for nearly ten minutes each day. We told each other about our lives, discussed the importance of learning other languages and even began to teach each other different words in Russian and Spanish every day. Once the semester started again, our routine was disrupted, but we chat back and forth as we can. His presence has completely shifted for me — what was once just a table to walk around has become a friend whose hellos contribute meaningfully to my day.</p>
<p class="p2">On the other hand, it is worth engaging not just with those whom you like and appreciate, but also with those who may seem to more negatively impact your day. As a second semester senior, there aren’t too many things I’ve always wanted to do at Brown that I’ve never really gotten around to, but for some reason a big one of those is interacting with the sin awareness day people — an opportunity which has unfortunately come and gone for me. Not to suggest that these people could become my friends like Jose, but they likewise present an opportunity for interaction outside my daily routine — the kind of interaction that can become a story to tell your friends. When it comes to the sin awareness day folks, the extent to which they attempt to use guilt about lifestyle to drive people to Christianity always manages to get under my skin. Ineffective as it might be, guilt has no place being used as a weapon against members of the Brown community. As such, I have some ideas about trying to beat them at their own game that I have never been bold enough to use, but that I suggest anyone with the time and interest give a try.</p>
<p class="p2">As someone who was raised in the church, nothing would satisfy me more than to make these people feel bad about their actions on their own terms. I would be very curious, for example, to hear their response to 1 Corinthians, in which Paul asks the question “What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside.” Or what would they say to Matthew, who directs Christians to “not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged.” From a Christian perspective, the idea that God hates all sin is true. But what God expects of Christian communities is not to hold non-Christians to their arbitrary moral standard, but to guard against hypocrisy among themselves.</p>
<p class="p2">Even on the grounds that these people might consider themselves “missionaries” to an unreached community, they fall far below the standard set out by the Great Commission. God does the work of saving, and merely asks that his followers plant the seeds; surely there is a more effective place to introduce the idea of Christianity than in the middle of a Western-educated, originally Protestant community? Jesus called his followers to demonstrate their transformation by stepping out of their comfort zone and taking the message of the gospel to the ends of the earth. Paul himself boasted about facing horrible abuse and danger in the name of reaching the unreached. In Matthew 7, Jesus explains that only those who really pursue this calling will reach heaven. If I were them, I would not be so confident that driving a few minutes to yell about sin into a microphone was what Jesus meant when He said “Faith without works is dead.”</p>
<p class="p2">Since sin awareness day this year has passed, I wanted to share these thoughts in the hope that someone will be able to get the satisfaction out of an interaction that I never had. Sure — it takes a lot of time out of your day, and might seem like more effort than it’s worth, but these kinds of encounters are what make life interesting, and what breaks us out of the routine that so often gets us down. Meeting people, conversing with them and engaging with their experiences (whether positively or negatively!) are what make up the stories we will take with us from Brown into the rest of our lives. Brown is about learning even when you are outside the classroom; our community attracts some of the most interesting, and certainly unique, people you may ever get the chance to meet — don’t miss out on the chance to learn from them in whatever ways you can!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">During my second semester as an undergraduate, it clicked. Brown is more than a place of learning; it is also an idea: a celebration of free inquiry and the pursuit of knowledge deployed in service of making our world a better place. Born from countless people, values and aspirations, it is a dynamic collection of layers that are ever accumulating, subject to the course of over 250 years of history. Like Earth’s geological strata that progressively build upon each other, the Brown of today stands on the Brown of yesterday to shape the Brown of tomorrow. Archeological philosophy aside, I found this realization profound, and it shaped how I saw myself in relation to Brown and in turn its relation to me. Brown is a part of my identity, and I am a part of it. This symbiosis is not temporarily commercialistic, but perpetually mutualistic.</p>
<p class="p2">For us who are lucky to call ourselves Brunonians, we are stewards of this idea of Brown, tasked to carry it with us throughout life beyond College Hill. No different than the expectation of living a life of usefulness and reputation, this responsibility is easier said than done. Lofty? Sure. Highfalutin? Slightly. But whether we like it or not, our lives are woven into the fabric of Brown, layered into its history and embodying the very idea we convey to our communities. In the seeds we plant and the dreams we manifest, Brown thrives. If we fail to believe or practice its ethos, it erodes.</p>
<p class="p2">When I first graduated from Brown during the sunset of Pax Obama, my class was sent off into the golden hour with parting words to be constructively irreverent, embracing our Brown spirit to be forces of good in the world. At the time, our country lived in blissful complacency while watching a disturbing insurgency play out before us. A mounting danger to the status quo emerged from anger and displacement coupled with huckster opportunism and now-confirmed criminality. The vocal majority dismissed this threat as a fleeting phenomenon. Yet overnight, the tragicomedy became reality. The rosy veneer crashed under the tumultuous undertow from a perfect storm long brewing in blue-collar homes, fringe media and dark-money conservative circles; all it took was the right people to unleash it.</p>
<p class="p2">Returning to Brown against the backdrop of our current climate made me revisit my role as a steward of the idea of Brown. In the aftermath of 2016, the values, norms and standards I practiced and believed in at Brown appeared to have lost worth in a world newly disrupted by forces of unconstructive upheaval. But in picking up the pieces, we have since found a revitalized appreciation for the norms that hold the world together and the values that bring people together. Though the tenets of progress, decency and civic virtue in the name of a free and open world may have wobbled, they have far from toppled. The idea of Brown is no different.</p>
<p class="p2">The idea of Brown today must be carried with greater vigor and passion than ever before. Against the tides of corrosiveness and maleficence, Brown is a resolute pillar of promise that inspires the better angels of our nature to take action. Perhaps more than just stewards, we are its faithful practitioners, the proud standard-bearers of a belief that the power of knowledge and discovery is stronger than intolerance and isolation. We are the next leaders and change-makers armed with the wisdom and constructive irreverence to foster human progress and goodness. We build bridges while tearing down walls. Where there is darkness, we shed light. Where there is ignorance, we share truth. Where there is fear, we inspire hope. This is our charge. We are Brunonians, and our world is worth fighting for.</p>

		<title>Calvelli &#039;19: Job advice from an unemployed senior</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I graduate in four months and have no idea what I’m doing next year. As so many fellow ’19-ers know, it is a terrifying feeling. The comfort and regularity of college life are rapidly giving way to an impending unknown where the only certainties are skyrocketing rents and more expensive access to the New York Times. Instead of being ghosted by that cute classmate you asked out, you’re now getting the brush from HR departments worldwide.</p>
<p class="p2">In this climate, Brown seniors’ common refrain is to lament that they’ll never get a job. Jokes and memes about our nebulous employment prospects abound. Students (like myself) avoid questions about their post-grad plans with abandon, posturing a resignation to live at home.</p>
<p class="p2">But this posturing, while perhaps an understandable outlet for graduation-induced anxiety, to me reflects an ignorance of the privilege our Brown education affords. It’s scary to not know what life holds after May. Still, we’re about to graduate from a super-elite university. While it’s important to recognize that not every student has the same background and career network, there’s every indication that a job will turn up sooner rather than later for most of us. So when someone asks you what you’re doing next year, resist the temptation to complain about how hard it is to secure gainful employment. Finding work is stressful and difficult and, for many people, has serious financial consequences. But it doesn’t serve anyone well to make a public performance of unemployability, especially when for most Brown students, such a jobless fate most likely won’t be the case.</p>
<p class="p2">Statistics illustrate that some of our fears might not be wholly rational. Around 91 percent of <a href="https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/life-after-brown">Brown graduates</a> each year immediately enter the workforce or graduate school. You might be in that 9 percent, but there’s a 91 percent chance you’re not. Although the Open Curriculum has allowed me to evade math courses, I’m still pretty sure 91 is greater than 9. While this data doesn’t reflect every individual’s experience, it does present a comforting picture for most of us.</p>
<p class="p2">Moreover, the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/national-employment-monthly-update.aspx">national unemployment rate</a> is 3.9 percent. <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nine-out-of-10-new-jobs-are-going-to-those-with-a-college-degree-2018-06-04">Ninety percent</a> of jobs created in the last year went to people who have graduated college. <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Recovery2020.Press-Release.pdf">A report</a> from the Georgetown Public Policy Institute found that by 2020, there will be five million more jobs requiring a college degree than there will be workers to fill them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p2">So as a college graduate, despite what your uncle who laughs at your classics degree might tell you, you are in an enviable position in the job market. That doesn’t even account for the fact that you’ll graduate from a prestigious university with <a href="https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors?search=brown">high graduate earnings</a> into a world where the name on your diploma can take you far.</p>
<p class="p2">None of these numbers will make a job magically appear for you. And getting a job is still a stressful, consequential endeavor, especially for people who can’t rely on their economic privilege to weather a stretch of unemployment. But the data should be a reminder that something will very likely materialize. Pretending that isn’t true is an insult to those navigating the labor market without the signaling power and vast network that our fancy-sounding degree carries.</p>
<p class="p2">Some people might respond, “Yeah, I know I could get some job, but not a good one in the field I want to work in.” To that I’d say, true! That’s precisely the distortion caused by the elite college bubble we inhabit. Our expectations for a good first job are skewed by the rare offers obtained by our friends from Goldman and McKinsey. The social pressure to be elite makes it seem like you need a fancy title to make a difference. And the Brown bubble can make many of us forget that most people need a job to put dinner on the table, not to begin shaping the world in their image as 22 year-olds.</p>
<p class="p2">Uncertainty is always part of the job search. But attending Brown acts as a big hedge against that uncertainty. When we complain about how hard it is for us to get work, we minimize the much more significant challenges faced by people who didn’t have the privilege to attend college, let alone an elite one.</p>
<p class="p2">By complaining, we also treat the job search as a burden, letting our fears drive a negative attitude. Instead of acting like we won’t get jobs and letting uncertainty make graduation stressful, I think we should acknowledge our position’s advantage and embrace the potential for growth this uncertainty provides.</p>
<p class="p2">So, don’t think of finding a job you love as an entitlement or as a box to check that makes your expensive education worth it. Instead, work to see the job search as an<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>opportunity to bring the values you’ve learned at Brown outside the college bubble. That search might be more erratic than the safe, regimented path many students took to get to Brown.</p>
<p class="p2">But it’s on us to embrace the opportunity to look beyond the allure of a six-figure salary with a recognizable job title and affirm that not having a job yet is both normal and okay. With that mindset, we will eventually find work we’ll be proud to do and share.</p>

		<title>Krishnamurthy ’19: Bring back the Brown Spectator</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2019/01/31/bring-back-brown-spectator/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the spring of 1986, the Brown Spectator published its inaugural issue. Proclaiming itself “The Right Alternative” to existing student publications, the Spectator aimed to provide an outlet for conservative and libertarian thought on a campus the journal’s staff alleged to be overwhelmingly liberal. Sadly, the Spectator isn’t around anymore. The last article on the journal’s website was published on July 6, 2014; the website, it appears, has been defunct since. (Digitized versions of the journal’s print edition are no longer available <a href="http://brown-spectator.com/">online</a>.) This is a shame. In the near future, the journal should be excavated from the dustbin of College Hill history and restored to life.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The Spectator’s resurrection would be a positive development on campus, especially for students interested in activism and progressive politics. For the record, I’m not a conservative, and I don’t want Brown to lose its character as an institution with a student body deeply concerned with justice and equality. In fact, I find mostly everything about American conservatism, particularly as it’s manifested by the Republican Party of President Trump’s first term, profoundly abhorrent.</p>
<p class="p2">Still, despite my revulsion toward the twenty-first century Republican agenda, I believe that my experience of Brown and my understanding of American politics could be enriched by the presence of clear-eyed conservative commentary — published on a platform devoted to conservative voices on campus, versus piecemeal contributions to existing student-run publications — from my peers. I want Brown students who lean right to have the opportunity to express their opinions openly, experience the process of putting together a publication and participate in student discourse.</p>
<p class="p2">I also want Brown students who lean left to leave campus armed with the ability to articulate forcefully the shortcomings of conservative ideas and reject them in public forums and in politics. I know that, as a progressive on a progressive campus, my views are often enthusiastically reaffirmed by those around me. As much as I like affirmation, however, it does not help me recognize the weaknesses in my arguments or forge stronger ones. The Spectator, in promulgating conservative arguments, could transform this reality. By having our own conceptions of the role of government, faith and justice in American life challenged, progressive students will have the chance to further sharpen our ability to e<span class="s1">mpathize with individuals of different political persuasions and develop a stronger facility with opposing arguments. In turn, we might be better equipped to not only debate and defeat conservative contentions, but also persuade others to embrace a progressive, inclusive vision for America. A reinvigorated Spectator on campus should be good practice for such work.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The Spectator, of course, was not without its deficiencies — and any enterprising conservatives on campus interested in reviving the journal should take care to avoid recreating them. For starters, the Spectator was funded entirely by external groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2006/10/31/outside-help-funds-more-issues-of-the-brown-spectator/">According to The Herald</a>, the journal received $2,000 from the Collegiate Network, an organization whose staid, bureaucratic name obscures its function as a sponsor of right-wing publications and activities on college campuses all over the United States. The remainder of the Spectator’s budget came from the Foundation for Intellectual Diversity, a group started by five Brown alums who wanted to amplify “underrepresented ideas” at the University. This reliance on external funding undermines the ability of the Spectator — or any student group, really — to bill itself as an organic, student-driven enterprise. Should there be a new iteration of the Spectator, its student managers ought to secure at least some funding from sources within the University. Even on a left-leaning campus like Brown’s, this shouldn’t be difficult; last semester, the Undergraduate Council of Students <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/12/05/ucs-approves-chapter-national-right-wing-organization/">approved</a> the creation of a campus chapter of Turning Point USA, a national right-wing group, the first step toward receiving Student Activities Office support.</p>
<p class="p2">Second, and perhaps more importantly, the Spectator’s former editors derived far too much pleasure from deliberate provocation. At an Oct. 20, 2006 lecture given by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., an environmental attorney and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, staff members of the Spectator distributed copies of the journal. That issue’s cover story, penned by Sam Quigley ’10, was titled, “Robert F. Kennedy, Jr: Another Joke from the Kennedy Family.” Given the tragic history of the Kennedy family, such an article comes across as an insensitive, bad-faith attack. Quigley justified the Spectator’s acrid, aggressive tone as essential to the vitality of campus discourse. “We have to grab people with rhetoric first,” <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2006/10/31/outside-help-funds-more-issues-of-the-brown-spectator/">he told The Herald</a>. Additionally, he said that “negativity is essential to any kind of democracy in order to discredit the current structure.” Assertive, reasoned polemicizing is one thing; berserk writing beyond the parameters of acceptable debate, produced purely for the sake of shocking or provoking readers, is another thing altogether. Hopefully, the editors of a resurrected Spectator will assume a more temperate framework for their writing and editorial decision-making. (And I’m not too worried about the Spectator becoming anything close to a Junior Varsity Breitbart — the alt-right politics exemplified and inflamed by President Trump does not encapsulate the full spectrum of conservative thought, and I think it’s unlikely that Brown students, who’ll have their names permanently attached to their contributions on the internet, will use the Spectator to peddle openly racist, sexist, or anti-immigrant sentiments.)</p>
<p class="p2">The task of restarting the Spectator will definitely be hard. Putting together a proposal for consideration by UCS, navigating the minutiae of Undergraduate Finance Board funding and assembling a team of students committed to the project are not easy. But there is a natural constituency for the Spectator, which, if managed properly, can serve a productive purpose on campus. In the grander scheme of things, the Spectator will be a useful training ground for students interested in making arguments about policy and partisan politics at higher levels, or, at the very least, becoming engaged citizens. After all, the fight for America’s soul — whether this country creates opportunities for average folks to get ahead, fully extends civil rights to all of its people or actualizes its highest ideals — is happening now, and young people with even an iota of interest in safeguarding their future cannot afford to sit this one out silently. <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2006/10/31/outside-help-funds-more-issues-of-the-brown-spectator/">As Quigley told The Herald</a>, in a democratic society, “the worst thing that can happen is that people become complacent.” Ultimately, I hope that the Spectator, on a campus brimming with political and activist energy, can operate as another bulwark against that complacence.</p>]]></content:encoded>
