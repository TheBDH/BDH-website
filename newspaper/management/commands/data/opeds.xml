		<title>Tisch ’17: Let’s not objectify our athletes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Earlier this week, several events circulated on Facebook promoting a Brown Athletics department-sponsored meet featuring the gymnastics team and the wrestling team. This Friday will be the third annual iteration of the event, a fundraiser for breast cancer awareness. Spectators are encouraged to #WearPink and #PackThePizz. As my life and the lives of many other members of the Brown community have been touched by cancer, I salute the athletics department and the teams involved for supporting this cause. But our lives have all been touched by the misogyny, sexism and traditional gender roles that have come to the forefront particularly in the election and Women’s Marches last week. It is for this reason that I implore the athletics department to take a long, hard look at why calling this event “Beauty and the Beast” is harmful and disrespectful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The “beauty” in “Beauty and the Beast” refers to the gymnastics team. I cannot deny that the tumbling passes and dance elements of gymnastics are beautiful. But gymnastics and the athletes who participate in the sport are far more than just beautiful. Anyone who watched Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, Aly Raisman and the rest of the USA gymnastics team at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games witnessed the sheer power and athleticism of the sport. Any inflexible person (like myself) who has struggled to do a simple cartwheel can appreciate the strength, balance and grit this sport requires. To market these hardworking athletes as simply “beauties” is to objectify them. This is unacceptable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The term “beast” is also problematic as it has connotations of wild aggression and hypermasculinity. Though often portrayed as a violent sport of domination, wrestling is actually a highly technical sport that requires tremendous care and skill. The misunderstood nature of the sport, combined with the hypermasculinity and aggression from the label “beast,” makes light of and normalizes these characteristics off the mat. Let’s not refer to these athletes with a label that implicitly condones hostility and violence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While “Beauty and the Beast,” the 1991 animated Disney film to which the event name most likely refers to, is regarded as a classic, it has been <a href="http://nca.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00335630.2013.835491">criticized</a> by activists and scholars alike for promoting domestic violence. The anthropomorphic teapots, utensils and household utilities that inhabit the Beast’s mansion in the film live in fear of his violent tendencies and aggressive outbursts. Though the Beast never directly strikes Belle or causes her bodily harm, he intimidates her, silences her and holds her hostage. By no means is this an example of a healthy relationship. By no means should the athletics department compare two teams that represent the University to this dynamic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the context of last week’s Women’s Marches and the growing marginalization of people who are not cisgender males, I urge the Brown Athletics Department to change the name of this event. It is especially inappropriate for an event that aims to showcase athletes (many of whom are not cis-males) and raise awareness for breast cancer to have a name so loaded with misogyny and bias. The new name should not speak to the presumed gender of the athletes on each team. The new name should not play with harmful stereotypes or traditional gender roles as portrayed in the media. The new name should not refer to works of popular culture that promote toxic relationship dynamics. I suggest a new name that either highlights breast cancer awareness or the equal athleticism and humanity of each team. This cause is important, and these athletes are talented and hardworking. It is more than enough to market this event for exactly what it is.</span></p>

		<title>Paxson P&#039;19: Supporting our students and scholars</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I want to thank the Brown alums who shared their concerns about the executive order on immigration and refugee policy in a Letter to the Editor in the Feb. 2 issue of The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is indeed an issue of the utmost importance for Brown, principally because it has significant implications for the personal well-being and mobility of members of our community and their families. Accordingly, in the days since the order was enacted, the University has taken a number of steps to make clear our position and ensure that our international students and scholars are safe, secure and free to study, teach and conduct research at Brown. I would add that we have done so even as developments related to its implementation remain fluid.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For students and scholars from the seven countries covered by the executive order, we have reached out to assure them that Brown is intent on protecting their status as members of the Brown community. More concretely, we are making available the following resources to support these individuals:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">— Access to immigration and legal advising;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">— Expanded opportunities to remain on campus throughout their time at Brown, including research engagements and internships during University holidays and breaks;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">— Housing assistance and other resources during these break periods.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For students and scholars who are prevented from traveling to campus, we are exploring the use of virtual teaching and learning platforms so that these individuals can continue to participate in the Brown educational experience.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For all other international students at Brown who have concerns about whether the executive order will impact their status at the University in any way, we have set in motion a number of processes aimed at providing up-to-date information and answering practical questions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Office of Global Engagement, in partnership with relevant offices across campus, will host several community gatherings and information sessions to support our international students. On Feb. 7, a legal advising workshop with an immigration lawyer is planned, followed by a panel discussion that includes staff members responsible for government and community affairs, visas and their compliance and campus life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We have added additional administrative staff members and an immigration consultant to assist with the increase in traffic to the Office of International Student and Scholar Services, which manages visa services and compliance for the University.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And we are encouraging all Brown community members, especially our international students and scholars, to register their international travel through the Brown University Global Assistance Program so that we can provide up-to-date medical and security information as well as other forms of travel assistance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With the launch of the Global Brown Community and Support referral system, we are encouraging all members of the Brown community to contact the OGE should they need any assistance to ensure their support and inclusion on campus. The OGE is also meeting with various international student groups and departments to answer questions and provide general support.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Further, I have asked the Office of the Provost to convene a working group comprised of the heads of major units on campus to address issues as they arise in a rapidly changing environment and to think proactively about how to safeguard our international students and scholars going forward.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Lastly, we are creating a web page on Brown’s website that will serve as a central platform for all information, guidance, materials and resources related to the executive order and its impact on our community. We expect that web page to launch in the coming week.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Looking ahead, we anticipate questions from prospective students who are awaiting admissions decisions in the coming months. We are therefore contacting applicants from the seven affected countries to reassure them that the executive order will not in any way affect their chance for admission and that, if admitted, their spots will be held until they are able to secure a visa.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">More generally, Brown has made its position on the executive order crystal clear: The order runs counter to our commitment to free inquiry and the advancement of knowledge; it is antithetical in letter and spirit to our insistence that individual students and scholars should be free to pursue their scholarship and learning without fear of intimidation or discrimination of any kind; and it contradicts our unconditional rejection of every form of bigotry, discrimination, xenophobia and harassment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I firmly believe that education and knowledge creation are global public goods. Our charge as a leading university is to engage fully in the world, bringing the most talented faculty and students to Brown without regard to nationality or religion. The executive order runs counter to American traditions and values, and it restricts the ability of Brown and other institutions of higher education to fulfill their missions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Brown is working closely with other universities to develop collective responses to the executive order.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">On Brown’s behalf, I have signed several letters of condemnation ­—­ from the Association of American Universities, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a group of peer university presidents — calling on the Trump administration to, variously, rescind the executive order; affirm the valuable contributions of international students to research, innovation and economic vitality; and shape immigration policies that honor the founding principles of the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In addition, the University’s initial responses to the executive order are reflected in two statements to our community that are posted on Brown’s website. Going forward, I would encourage alums and all members of our community to check Brown’s website to learn about Brown’s response to this and other issues that may arise in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Finally, the executive order has placed all of us in uncharted territory to some extent, and like so many other colleges and universities, Brown is in the early stages of responding. In light of this, you should know that as Trump administration guidance under the order continues to be developed, it will remain our highest priority to ensure the safety, security and status of all affected Brown students and scholars.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Again, I thank our alums for sharing their views on this critical issue and for their passionate commitment to upholding Brown’s values.</span></p>

		<title>Powell: Recent columns misconstrue admissions process</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/15/powell-recent-columns-misconstrue-admissions-process/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2017 03:35:58 +0000</pubDate>

		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.browndailyherald.com/?p=2824831</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recent opinion pieces in The Herald have made assumptions about the University’s admission process and the priorities we emphasize. We believe strongly that Brown flourishes because of the talents of its students, faculty, staff and alumni, and it is disheartening and disappointing to read assertions about our goals that paint a picture of the University that does not resemble the reality we have worked hard to achieve.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While one Letter to the Editor expressed skepticism over our efforts to achieve gender balance (“Letter: Brown should go gender-blind in admission,” Dec. 6) and another wrote that we have “institutionalized” a preference for elite private high schools over others (“Colby ’20: Equal admission rates for all,” Jan. 26), these opinions are not grounded in fact. They do a disservice to our mission, which includes a focus on strengthening the human connections on College Hill.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is not possible to detail the expansive multitude of ways we demonstrate a commitment to building a student body that is exceptionally talented and diverse, but it’s important to ensure that perceptions about Brown’s admission practices are shaped by facts. There are several that help address the recent misplaced claims.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">First, in the past year alone, as a result of targeted recruitment, applications from first-generation students have risen by 14 percent. Brown has specific initiatives focused on ensuring that students from a full range of backgrounds are well represented in our applicant pool. One such program is QuestBridge, a partnership designed to help Brown attract and enroll high-achieving, low-income students from around the United States. This year, Brown has increased its matches with QuestBridge, matching with 20 QuestBridge students compared to three last year. In addition, in the past year, our admission officers have doubled the number of visits to community-based organizations that advance college access. Recognizing that applying to college can also be a costly process, we waive the application fee for any student who finds it a hardship.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The second important point is that Brown admission counselors visited nearly 700 high schools in the fall of this year, and 70 percent of those were public schools. There is no school or set of high schools that receives priority review. All high schools are treated equally, and we always review applicants in the context of their high school setting. We also do not compare students from one high school to another. Each and every applicant is considered on their individual merits, talents and fit for Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Third, recognizing that a college visit is one of the strongest determining factors for a student’s acceptance of Brown’s offer of admission, we doubled the funding available for travel grants to low-income students to attend A Day on College Hill. The program brings admitted students from all income groups to campus to get a sense of life at Brown. And we remain committed to need-blind admission; we do not consider an applicant’s ability or inability to pay the cost of tuition when making admission decisions (for U.S. citizens).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The next point is that the admission process is the same for all students independent of gender. There is absolutely no inherent advantage or disadvantage based on gender identification. Admission and enrollment patterns at Brown often mirror patterns that exist nationwide. Gender gaps that begin in primary school and continue through tertiary education should not be mistaken as any form of discrimination at the higher education level.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And finally, it’s worth noting that the objective academic qualifications of our admitted and enrolled students at Brown are as high as ever.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the admission office, we know that Brown is a better institution when we invite diverse perspectives from students with intellectual passion and a deep conviction to contribute to and continue to strengthen the community. The admission office<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— with many staff who are alums — is part of this community and has the honor of helping to build it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The recent opinion pieces in The Herald suggest that, perhaps, the admission process is not “fair.” But it’s important not to confuse “selective” with “fair.” It’s an unfortunate reality that any admission process that admits only 9 percent of its applicants may seem unfair to some applicants in the other 91 percent. We should be proud that over 32,000 students applied for admission this year. And yet our commitment to maintaining a first-year class of 1,665 students means that many remarkable applicants will not be offered admission. Our goal is to admit and enroll a class that will uphold Brown’s values of academic excellence and diversity of thought.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I encourage any current student or alum to join in the efforts we have already undertaken. Volunteer to tutor at a local public school; offer encouragement to a young student who dreams of one day attending college; offer your support to a college access organization; or sign up to be an alumni interviewer and share your love of Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We are together in the shared vision of Brown’s success. As we move forward with the class of 2021 and beyond, we will continue to focus on students who demonstrate deep intellectual curiosity, potential for leadership, diverse perspectives and a commitment to the Brown community and to the world.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Almost immediately after Brown’s budget for fiscal year 2018 was approved by the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/12/corporation-approved-budget-aims-achieve-financial-stability/">Corporation</a>, many students reacted to the 4 percent tuition increase and the projected deficit of nearly $4.8 million. Tuition was <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/14/rowland-17-questioning-budget/">compared</a> negatively with the much lower inflation rate, and the deficit was seen by some as a sure sign of mismanagement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As students, we should be skeptical of the budget. Brown’s ability to manage fiscal growth will affect not only future generations of students, but the relative value of our degrees long after we graduate. We must demand a budget that matches our priorities and sets a clear path forward.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was with this exact skepticism that, in the spring of my sophomore year, I applied to join the University Resources Committee. The URC is a 25-person committee chaired by the provost that includes faculty members, staff members, administrators and students, including four undergraduates. I sat on the URC for two years and, along with my undergraduate peers, saw the creation of two annual budgets, including the FY18 budget. This budget, totaling $1.061 billion, funds the day-to-day operations of the University; it is separate from funds raised in the BrownTogether campaign and from funds used to construct new buildings.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The process of creating and approving a budget takes six months. The URC began our budget process last fall by educating ourselves on department operations — we learned about the costs associated with Brown, which totals approximately $100,000 per undergraduate, as well as the revenue sources that pay for these costs, including the endowment payout, sponsored research, donations and tuition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As the budget cycle progresses, we inevitably come to the large decisions, among them tuition, the deficit and millions in </span><span class="s2">budgetary increases requested by departments. None of these numbers are dictated to us by the Corporation, the president or any member of the administration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are decisions that we — students, staff, administrators and faculty — make together. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The result of this process is that the URC simultaneously considers tuition increases, budget increases and potential deficits. As such, it is impossible not to equate the three — more budget increases mean a higher deficit, lower tuition means fewer budget increases, and so on. With these myriad options, how does the URC actually make the decisions that are so important to Brown?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Simply put, we return to our values. Many of these values are articulated well in Building on Distinction, including commitments to diversity, academic excellence and creative expression, while others emerge and evolve as new classes of students enter our campus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">As an undergraduate on the committee, it was my job and the job of my peers to ensure our meetings were full of student values and perspectives. To that end, the four-person undergraduate delegation met daily with student leaders, student groups, classmates and community members; these perspectives informed our decisions. Among the values represented in the two most recent budgets are:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">— Equality: Through expansion of financial aid, Brown will continue to become more accessible and affordable for middle- and low-income families, and the elimination of the suite fee will ensure that no student must defer living with friends because they cannot afford it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">— Health: The URC added dental coverage for graduate students, while expanding the number of staff members in both Health Services and Counseling and Psychological Services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">— Diversity: This year’s budget includes $5.2 million to support the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, just as the FY17 budget <a href="https://brown.edu/web/documents/provost//URC_FY17ReportFinal.pdf">proposed</a> a “dean level” staff member who would ensure greater support for first-generation and low-income student populations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">These investments are accompanied by a tuition increase. Expanded services equal a higher sticker price, though continued expansion of financial aid will ensure that Brown continues to become more affordable for a large percentage of families. And while there is a modest deficit, the committee determined that these investments should not wait, and the URC has a clear path for eliminating the structural deficit in the years to come.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">This value-based approach runs counter to two of the common myths I hear about tuition increases. The first is that tuition is raised due to some form of upper-level collusion among the educational elites. This is patently false: Brown’s tuition is set by our committee The second myth is that added revenue from tuition dollars is being funneled to a mysterious “other.” This narrative is particularly pernicious because it assumes a lack of goodwill among the committee members and seeks to stoke anger rather than understanding.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">I am heartened when I see fellow students dismiss these false narratives. The values in the FY18 budget are not the result of cynicism or derision, but of near-constant activism among student populations — activism that champions equality, health and diversity as worthy ideals, and honest dialogue as the means to achieve these ends. In the coming months and years, there will be ample opportunity for this type of value-advocacy. Brown will face the same old questions of tuition and deficits, while also attempting to build alternative revenue streams, maintain an undergraduate focus and strengthen the value proposition of the University-college in our modern world. I look forward to the Brown community continuing this important dialogue as we chart our path forward together.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Four semesters ago, I vowed to my roommate that I would take a bullet to save any elephant from poaching. Astonished, he asked,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Why would you do that?” I grinned and said, “Because wild animals, elephants specifically, are majestic and they don’t really care about us.” Then I went on to describe the traits of elephants and the different nuances that make them intelligent and compassionate — the usual stuff you read in the papers and watch on National Geographic but interspersed with personal anecdotes to corroborate my arguments. Then came the sad truths: About 100 elephants are killed every day in Africa, my home continent, and the total number of endangered species increases by the day. In a few decades, these majestic beasts will not be trekking across this green earth (if it will be green at all!). My voice trailed off as I narrated these facts and rose again as I tried to explain why elephants might survive — because non-governmental organizations, governments and conservation activists are working tirelessly to protect elephants and any endangered species. It is with this belief that I had joined Save the Elephants three years ago to help protect African wildlife.</p>
<p class="p1">But now, I don’t care anymore. In fact, I am resigned to seeing the elephants extinct in the near future. If the previous sentence made blood run cold in your veins, then brace yourself for this: I would have the rhinos, the lions, the buffalos, the cheetahs and any of the endangered species disappear from the savannahs and forests all over the African continent. Gone. Thrust into the history books — joining the ranks of the dinosaurs — for the study of our future generations. Rather than continuing to watch as we slowly and mercilessly slaughter endangered species, I prefer to get done with this inevitable brutality and have us face the consequences of our greed.</p>
<p class="p1">My recent disillusionment and apathy for the conservation of animals, specifically African animals, has been festering for some time. For a long time, I’d been troubled and even willing to sacrifice my life for endangered wild animals if it came to that. In fact, <a href="http://www.gameranger.org/news-views/media-releases/96-call-for-action-against-increasing-risk-to-game-rangers.html">many other people have suffered this fate</a>. <a href="http://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/shocking-facts-about-how-the-illegal-wildlife-trade-drives-species-extinction/">Many continue to do so</a>. But I realized that we had reached a hopeless point in our quest when the northern white rhinos’ population dwindled to a mere three. On the entire planet! Then the number of chimpanzees decreased, and the gorillas, and the lions, and the whales and so on. And still, the animal conservationists continued to preach that we could replenish these species, increase their numbers and ensure their continued survival.</p>
<p class="p1">Just as I was naive two years ago, you might also be fooled into believing that there is something that can be done, that we can somehow save the white rhinos and the elephants. But do you really think three northern white rhinos can save an entire species? And even if you do — disregarding the fact that these beasts don’t reproduce as fast as is needed — can we save them with poachers at their heels (or hooves) day and night?</p>
<p class="p1">Poachers: villains who have decided to wipe the planet of its biodiversity and who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/30/british-pilot-killed-by-elephant-poachers-tanzania">shoot down ranger planes</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/10/cameroonian-ranger-killed-wildlife-poachers">kill rangers</a> to get to their target animals. Because of them, governments and NGOs spend millions of dollars on anti-poaching equipment and personnel, establish ivory trade bans and educate the public in a bid to protect and save the almost-extinct animals in Africa. But do not be mistaken: Poachers are not the enemy. The American, European and Asian markets are the real enemy; these market forces are the tyrannical overlords that drive the poaching empire, oblivious of the effects of their unwarranted consumerism of ivory and other wildlife products. For example, in 2015, Cecil the lion was killed by an American dentist, Walter Palmer, who walked free even amid outcry from the international community. After almost driving the southern white rhinos to extinction in the 1800s, Europeans now provide a market for legal and illegal trade for endangered wildlife products. China leads the world in this trafficking empire.</p>
<p class="p1">Once again, the Africans have been played — their animals have been eradicated from their savannahs and forests right under their noses. By the west and the east. I don’t mean to downplay the extensive efforts by various foreign and local governments, NGOs and soldiers to protect the endangered. Their efforts are appreciated and necessary. What I critique, though, is the late timing of the international community in joining this animal conservation bandwagon; the reluctance and negligence of international governments to address climate change and its effects on biodiversity; and the well-intentioned but failing conservation efforts of various organizations and governments, as evidenced by the continued dwindling numbers of endangered wildlife.</p>
<p class="p1">But what finally hurled me into this disillusionment is the inordinate focus of animal conservation over the wellness of people, especially in a continent that has most of the poorest countries in the world. Too many resources are invested in this lost cause, detracting from funding toward humanitarian efforts and poverty relief. Here is the truth: All the preaching and high praise of animal conservation is a losing battle — a battle that we continually fail at and might catastrophically fail at very soon.</p>
<p class="p1">So, I urge you, adventurous folks, to enjoy watching and reading about endangered animals while they exist. As for me, I am watching and waiting for the scramble of the horns, teeth and skins to end. Then I will begin searching for those wielding the precious jewels, earrings and doormats of lion skins. I will find the tragic remains of the endangered animals we have lost. I will commemorate. I will cremate.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Before coming to Brown, I had never felt discriminated against as a result of my disability. Despite the crippling anxiety that I have dealt with since the first grade, it was always my towering stature and poor eyesight that made me feel like an outsider in my community. Mental health issues were unsurprisingly prevalent at my small private high school in the middle of Washington, D.C., and most of my peers felt comfortable enough to discuss and share their struggles with mental illness.</p>
<p class="p3">As September quickly approached and my matriculation to Brown became imminent, I grew more and more excited about the idea of studying at a university that most likely would boast an average height taller than five-foot six-inches. When I arrived on campus, I immediately felt at home among the similarly-sized basketball and volleyball players. For a moment, I felt blissfully content, and all of my insecurities faded away. That is, until classes and my subsequent involvement with the Student and Employee Accessibility Services began.</p>
<p class="p3">I would expect Brown, as a liberal institution, to provide students with progressive care. At the least, I expected the basic standard of treatment that the law requires. My accommodations have not been viewed as a collective interest of the office, and instead I have been blamed and reprimanded for the mistakes of the SEAS office and university professors. SEAS’ tendency to lean toward internal efficiency — due in part to the sheer number of individuals with disabilities at Brown — has forced me to navigate several breaches of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a piece of civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of any type of disability, physical or mental, alone.</p>
<p class="p3">Generally speaking, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 — essentially the predecessor of the ADA — states that “no otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability” be excluded from or discriminated against in any program that receives federal financial assistance. In terms of accommodation services for students with disabilities at postsecondary institutions, colleges must provide services where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program or activity conducted by a public entity. To summarize, the University cannot legally exclude students who have documented accommodations from fully participating in basic University activities and must provide resources or make necessary accommodations so that each student may benefit from equal opportunity.</p>
<p class="p3">Since the beginning of my college career, I have dealt with unfair treatment in regard to the accommodations that I undeniably should have. When a professor accidentally mixed up accommodations for the first midterm of my freshman year, I was obliged to perform a series of anxiety-provoking tasks — including taking my exam in Salomon 101 with 200-plus students (instead of a private room), turning in my exam and walking to an unfamiliar building at 9 p.m. to finish the test with my extra time only to find the front door locked.</p>
<p class="p3">On multiple occasions, I have spent nights before major exams fighting for documented accommodations that I am legally required to have, limiting valuable study time and increasing anxiety leading up to the test. The night before an exam, a teaching assistant told me that to receive extra time to take that exam during the 50-minute class period (I had been granted accommodations for an extra 25 minutes), I would have to stay after class to finish and miss half of my concurrent 1 p.m. class. Therefore, I was given the choice between forgoing my extra time or missing class. After a series of email exchanges with SEAS and the professor and TAs of the course, at midnight I was left with no response and no answer.</p>
<p class="p3">Approximately two hours before the exam the next day, the professor affirmed that missing class was my only option to receive the extra time. I was denied participation in a program or activity — my class — which is not only illegal, but also heightened my anxiety significantly. What’s more is that the email conversations the night prior caused me to lose several hours of valuable study time. These incidents obviously affected my performance on these exams. I receive accommodations to alleviate my anxiety and to put me on a fair playing field. Instead, I have regularly been subjected to unfairness that has ironically resulted in more stress, a ten-fold increase in anxiety and lower grades. Despite my attempts to communicate with SEAS both prior to and after these incidences, these situations keep occurring and SEAS has failed to properly accommodate me.</p>
<p class="p3">Frankly, I expected more from my dream school. I was thrilled to be a part of the liberal, open-minded and unprejudiced university that had been at the top of my list since I was a child. And while for the most part this has been my experience, I have been disappointed in not only the way I have been treated by professors, but also in SEAS’ lack of responsibility in holding professors accountable for these errors. If Brown truly is the progressive institution that it purports to be, then the mental well-being of students should be viewed as a priority, not merely a threat to the efficiency of the administration. Brown has a responsibility to provide fair treatment to all individuals it accepts into its gates.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Last Friday, on your way to class or while dining at the Ratty, you may have noticed a large group of young, enthusiastic middle school students taking in Brown for the first time. These 48 seventh-grade students attend Roosevelt Middle School in New Bedford, Massachusetts and were visiting Brown on a trip sponsored by the New Bedford High School Young Alumni Association. Most of these students will be the first in their family to attend college, and this was the beginning of the conversation about applying to, paying for and attending college.</p>
<p class="p3">In January 2015 during my junior year at Brown, a group of recent graduates of New Bedford High School founded the school’s Young Alumni Association. Over the past two years, the organization has grown, and as alumni we have committed ourselves to ensuring that every student in our city has a real and equal opportunity to achieve success through education. As graduates of an urban school system, we understand the challenges that students in our community face, but we also appreciate the diverse, hard-working culture that makes New Bedford an exceptional place to attend school and to live. Through a combination of camaraderie and shared understanding, we empower students by encouraging them to set high standards for themselves and providing them with resources to help them to succeed.</p>
<p class="p3">I recall my own challenges at Brown that stemmed from growing up in a very different environment than most of my peers. At times, it wasn’t easy being the person who hadn’t traveled much, who worked and stayed home over spring break rather than take expensive trips and who didn’t come to Brown with all the gadgets many of my peers possessed. Fortunately, I had a strong core group of family, friends at Brown and mentors who made my Brown experience both enriching and very enjoyable. But, as I told the students from Roosevelt Middle School, my time at Brown made me realize the full potential of the worthwhile experiences I had accumulated growing up in a community like New Bedford. I also realized from my fellow high school graduates that I wasn’t alone in facing these challenges in transitioning to a college community that was, in some ways, worlds apart from where we grew up. Thus, as an organization, we decided to use our collective college experiences to help prepare students in New Bedford for life after high school and encourage them to be active on their college campuses and in their home community.</p>
<p class="p3">That being said, I would be remiss if I didn’t attribute our success to institutions like Brown that help transform our various initiatives from thought to reality. On behalf of the New Bedford High School Young Alumni Association, I’d like to recognize and thank the individuals and groups at Brown who made last Friday’s trip possible. During the planning process, we received ample assistance from the Office <span class="s1">of College Admission, which helped coordinate the visit and paid for the students’ lunches. Specifically, Matthew Price, associate director of admission, took time out of his busy schedule to run an exclusive information session for these students. Also, we are thankful to the for First-Generation College and Low-Income Student Center for hosting a panel of Brown students who discussed their experiences as the first in their family to attend college. I would especially like to recognize UCS President Viet Nguyen ’17 for his work putting the panel together and opening FLIC to these students from New Bedford. Additionally, I’d like to thank Brown Dining Services for accommodating the students, and all other Brown personnel who made the visit a success. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Each member of the Brown community — student, staff, alums, faculty — can change the course of a young person’s life. The most inspiring words spoken at my commencement by far were delivered by Thomas Catena ’86, who addressed the class of 2016 from Sudan where he was administering medical care to less fortunate people living near his hospital. Catena encouraged us to spend our lives giving all we could muster to help those who have nothing. Brown’s willingness to open its gates to these students from New Bedford and use its vast financial and intellectual capital to extend a helping hand to those who most need support shows that Brown stays true to the words of Catena. That, in my opinion, is Brown at its best.</span></p>

		<title>Drury ’17: Cameron, Calais and unaccompanied kids</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s estimated that 90,000 unaccompanied child refugees live in Europe. Last year, an amendment was passed by the British Parliament establishing a scheme to transfer 3,000 child refugees to the United Kingdom, though so far only 200 cases have been processed. David Cameron, who is speaking later today at Brown, was prime minister when this law was passed; two weeks ago the law was scrapped. David Cameron’s legacy is Brexit, and Brexit found much of its final momentum in anti-migration politics and fear. What does Cameron think about these children and the failure of the British government to follow through with its resettlement promise last March? There is a chance that this issue won’t even be addressed at today’s lecture or in the question and answer session.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Calais, France is the closest place in Europe to the soon-to-be independent United Kingdom. For years, migrants and refugees from all over the world have been temporarily staying in this port town as they try and sneak onto lorries — trailer trucks — heading to England via the Chunnel. In October 2016 it was estimated that over 10,000 refugees settled in a camp near Calais called the “Jungle.” This figure included an estimated 1,200 unaccompanied minors. The French government evicted the camp at the end of October, sending adult residents to accommodation centers around the country to wait while their asylum claims were processed. The French and British governments could not reach an agreement about who was responsible for the unaccompanied children. As a result, the children were held in a collection of converted shipping containers during and after the eviction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I spent four months working at a community kitchen in the Jungle, through the eviction and the week of uncertainty during which the children were held in the containers. Our daily presence in camp meant that we took part in an unofficial child protection network. We administered first aid, took children to the doctor, brought them toothbrushes and were always a phone call away should they be arrested or detained by the police. One boy came to the kitchen with an infected toe, and after days of changing his bandage (he had no socks), he showed me his arm, covered in scars. Pointing at one, he said, “Taliban.” Pointing at another, he said, “dog.” Pointing at a third, he said, “fire.” At 12 he had already lost his childhood yet still possessed much hope that he would find safety in the UK. He was eligible for resettlement via the Dubs Amendment. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The upper chamber of the British Parliament, the House of Lords, passed the Dubs Amendment on March 21, 2016. It provided a legal framework for 3,000 unaccompanied minors to be resettled in the UK. Cameron was Prime Minister at the time. Although never a vocal supporter of the Dubs Amendment, Cameron eventually stepped out of the way to let it pass, authorizing the processing of up to 3,000 resettlement cases of unaccompanied minors in Europe. It seems important to again remember the context; there are an estimated 90,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Europe. In May 2016, the Guardian reported Cameron’s promise that the British government was going “to do more” for child refugees.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cameron in many ways opened the Pandora’s box of Brexit with his 2013 effort to unite the Conservative Party behind an in/out referendum and his campaign promise in 2014 to review the UK’s relationship to Brussels and the European Union. British nationalism and frustration with EU bureaucracy certainly fueled the Leave campaign, but as the vote drew closer, anti-immigration sentiments became overtly part of the discussion. Since the closure of the Jungle in October, only 200 resettlement cases have been processed under the Dubs Amendment. Two weeks ago, on March 7, the British Parliament voted to cancel the scheme, allowing at most 150 more cases to be processed before ending all action under Dubs this month. This leaves at least 650 children, promised in November to have their cases processed in weeks, with no opportunity for resettlement and no explanation why. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Jungle, these children were vulnerable to sexual and physical assault, human traffickers, manipulation and exploitation. With contact from the British Home Office decreasing and ultimately stopping, these children have been streaming back to Calais from their accommodation centers. The closure of the Dubs scheme seals the intended safe and legal path for these children to get to the UK. Their only option now is back in Calais — illegally sneaking into the UK on the back of lorries. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From my perspective, it is unimaginable that the British government would refuse to accept these children, many of whom will be welcomed by family already in the UK. I looked forward to the opportunity to hear what Cameron might say on the subject — his experience and knowledge gained from six years as British Prime Minister would certainly provide a different perspective on this issue. But I found out that at his lecture today, he will not host an open question and answer session. Rather, President Christina Paxson P’19 will lead the Q&amp;A between herself and Cameron; she has solicited questions from members of the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and interested parties may submit questions to her for review. But why this filtering?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I appreciate that Cameron is coming to speak at Brown, but I don’t want a sanitized discussion that hides the darker, still very relevant parts of his legacy. I want to know why he didn’t support the Dubs Amendment last spring as Prime Minister and only begrudgingly let it pass after pressure from members of Parliament and the British public. I want to know what he thinks will happen to these children who were told by the Home Office that their cases would be processed, only to be left without explanation or resolution. I want Cameron to engage with this painful and complicated issue and bring the highest possible level of discourse to this campus. I will probably disagree with him, but as James Baldwin once wrote, “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.” Let’s face the issue of immigration, child refugees and the closure of the Dubs Amendment later this afternoon.</span></p>

		<title>Betuel ’16: In defense of Ivy League recruiting</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2011, I had dreams of playing soc</span><span class="s1">cer for Brown. A player for a small-town club team, I had been on a series of select teams and won some state and country recognition. I loved Brown, but I craved the student athlete experience. And in fall 2012, I became a Brown varsity athlete. But I was not recruited. I walked on to the women’s crew team as a freshman and rowed for four years, winning an NCAA title in 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In high school, I would have given anything to be a recruited college athlete — especially at a Division I school. Yet, there is a large percentage of the Brown community (and the Ivy League community at large) that has taken an alternative stance toward their recruited counterparts: They believe that recruited athletes don’t deserve to be here at all. This sentiment was voiced in a Yale Daily News <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2017/02/27/aronson-admissions-and-athletics/">column</a> in February. Most recently, Owen Colby ’20 lamented the “disproportionate focus on athletic recruitment” in his <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/24/colby-20-stop-overvaluing-brown-athletics/">column</a> in The Herald (“Stop overvaluing Brown athletics,” Mar. 24).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> These writers use colorful vocabulary and quotations from school charters to disguise an accusation directed at our athletes: “You don’t belong here. You are not one of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For students who are supposed to champion diversity and inclusion, this is a painfully limited outlook. Do you truly believe that the standard of admission to places like Brown is solely the number of A’s on your transcript, or a 95th percentile SAT II? Of course not. It’s about extracurriculars — it’s about passion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These things are part of the holistic admission process maintained by elite U.S. universities because they are forms of signaling. In 1973, Nobel Prize-winning economist Michael Spence delivered his <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/spence/1973%20job%20market%20signalling.pdf">paper</a> on job market signaling, in which he examined the relationship between education, employers and the labor market. He concluded that while education may not increase your productivity, it still has a value when it comes to determining wages and getting a job. Basically, your diploma is a hardcover humblebrag — an easy way to say, “I work really hard and achieve a lot,” without actually saying it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can decide what you think a Brown degree should signal. It absolutely includes academic achievement. But is that all? A Brown degree also signals passion and a commitment to pursuing things at the highest level. This is why the Admission Office looks at far more than academics to decide who is afforded the opportunity to carry the Brown legacy. The same way your Brown degree will “signal” your ability to perform to a potential employer, certain high school achievements signal to Brown admissions that you are a highly-qualified applicant capable of meeting this standard once you graduate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With this in mind, how is being a great athlete not an indicator of excellence? If you can run a 4:40 mile, sink a three-pointer with two players guarding you or win a national championship in high school, you have set yourself apart by pursuing something at the highest level. People who excel at what they do embody the excellence that places like Brown exist to cultivate. Their achievements are signals of excellence, just like a high SAT score signals test-taking excellence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When you become a student athlete at Brown, you decide to pursue athletic excellence on the court, field, track or water. So when Colby argues that Brown should not emphasize athletic success, he is arguing that Brown should not support students pursuing a form of mastery. Insinuating that the University should not support this is ludicrous.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Maybe this attitude comes from antagonism toward athletic recruiting. You may believe that because Brown “lowers” its academic standards (usually test score benchmarks) to admit great athletes, they are less deserving of their places here. But you would be hard-pressed to find a Brown student who got in simply because they had stellar grades and test scores. Brown turns down thousands of these applicants every year. To get into Brown, you have to set yourself apart from the crowd by being great at something. Achievement in sports is one way to do this.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those who are antagonistic toward college sports often bemoan the recruited spots that are reserved for athletes in each admitted class. But these recruiting spots are far from free rides. They are some of the most hotly contested prizes in high school athletics. In some ways, choosing to pursue admission as a recruited athlete may be an even harder path to walk than the normal admission route.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the class of 2020, 32,390 people applied to Brown. Of those, 3,015 were accepted. That gives us an admission <a href="https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/explore/admission-facts">rate</a> of 9.3 percent, according to the Admission Office’s website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now look at the percentage of high school athletes who are able to make the jump from high school to college athletics. According to a study conducted by the NCAA, only 2.1 percent of high school baseball players will play DI <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/estimated-probability-competing-college-athletics">baseball in college</a>. Only 2.4 percent of female soccer players will play DI college soccer. Women’s ice hockey sends 9 percent of high school athletes on to play DI hockey — the highest percentage of any NCAA sport for men and women. This is still lower than Brown’s overall admit rate for the class of 2020. This is for all DI NCAA schools — limit this to the Ivy League, and those numbers would decrease even more.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This was my admission experience at Brown. An all-county soccer player in high school, I wanted nothing more than to play soccer at Brown. I drove two hours to soccer practices three days a week, and spent summers flying around the country to play in college showcase tournaments. At the end of the day, I didn’t make the cut — I would not be one of those 2.4 percent of female soccer players who could play DI soccer. But in May 2012, I was accepted into Brown’s class of 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So when you see athletes on campus, repress the instinct to judge them as unworthy of their place on College Hill. They are the cream of the crop. They earned one of a handful of spots to become recruited Ivy League athletes. And if you inquire further, you will likely find that they are excelling academically as well.</span></p>

		<title>Meyers ’16: Stop misrepresenting Brown student-athletes</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/03/meyers-16-stop-misrepresenting-brown-student-athletes/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is always distressing to read an opinion piece (“Stop overvaluing Brown athletics,” Mar. 24) from a non-athlete who likely has little to no interaction with Brown’s athletic domain. It is especially upsetting to read such a response from a first-year who has even more limited exposure to the impact that athletics have not only on athletes themselves, but also the University as a whole and the community that the University represents. Therefore, I contest the claim that Brown athletics are overvalued; on the contrary, I contend that the impact of sports at the school is truly undervalued.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Inevitably, there will be a chorus of readers who will dismiss this response because I was a four-year varsity athlete. As the argument will go, “He wore the brown, cardinal and white. Therefore, he is a shill for the Athletics Department.” In reality, this assumption could not be further from the truth. I have had more than my fair share of disagreements with the Athletic Department’s treatment of certain sports, especially my sport of swimming and diving.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Regardless of my differences with the athletic department, I ask you to put yourself in the shoes of a student-athlete applying to Brown during their senior year. They spend many years preparing for this moment, when the culmination of academic success in high school combines with thousands of hours on the field, in the pool or on the court. This conscious decision to apply to Brown or any other Ivy League institution means that the student voluntarily forgoes potential scholarship money that could and would have been provided by another school in order to represent their school as a student-athlete. Nearly every student-athlete with whom I interacted over my four years at Brown had offers from state schools, Patriot League universities or other institutions that were willing to reduce or eliminate tuition for the student in return for dedication to their sport. Brown athletes eschew these scholarships in pursuit of a more academically rigorous four years while representing the university they love.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While these student-athletes essentially compete “for free,” rather than costing Brown millions of dollars in athletic scholarships, Ivy League athletics provide a level of exposure to the University that is undervalued. If you tuned into ESPN last weekend as I did, you might have noticed that in the live coverage of the NCAA hockey tournament, the familiar Brown logo was visible on the boards as well as in the center of the ice at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center. Additionally, every camera zoom on the nets at the venue made a pitch for “Brown Hockey.” This exposure does not even account for the amount of revenue that the event brought to Brown, Providence and Rhode Island as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Owen Colby ’20 also writes that “support for athletes and attendance at games … would likely be enhanced in a school where teams are composed of largely walk-on and non-recruited athletes.” If he can find hundreds of students at Brown who will commit to giving up over 30 hours a week (because let’s be honest, the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/college-student-athletes-spend-40-hours-a-week-practicing-2015-1">20-hour limit</a> set by the NCAA does not include prehab, rehab, traveling to practices and training) to fill team rosters, I am willing to entertain his proposal. If Colby can weave through the maze of Graduate Center Bar on any given night (especially a Friday) and ask students to go home to prepare for a 5 a.m. practice the next morning rather than having another beer, I am supportive of his efforts. If he is willing to ask students to deprive themselves of both sleep and study time for practice while still being expected to perform at the same academic level as their peers, I can get behind the walk-on model.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this vein, Colby argues that student-athletes do not deserve to attend Brown because of lower academic admission standards. But if this is the case, distribution for class grades should follow an oil and water relationship. Do non-athletes rise to the top in terms of academic performance with student-athletes consistently falling below their peers? The truth is that student-athletes compete on the same academic plane as their counterparts — and succeed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Additionally, I fail to see how student-athletes are the only people being given some sort of “alteration” in the admission process by factoring in an applicant’s high school extracurriculars. There are over 30,000 applicants to Brown. Does every admitted student have a perfect 4.0 GPA and a 36 on their ACT, or does the University accept some students who do not reach these pinnacles of academic excellence? Is the award-winning high school trumpet player who had a 3.7 and 34 on his or her ACT not given a leg-up over the student who studied for those perfect marks to pad his Ivy League applicant resume? If Colby can put forth a perfectly merit-based system at Ivy League institutions in which students are selected strictly by higher education qualifications, regardless of extracurricular emphasis, I would suggest he propose that arrangement as his national standard for higher education.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Do we not, as a university and a society, want to promote well-rounded graduates who are more than just bookworms? If our goal is to foster the development of unidimensional students and humans, I will concede every point made by Colby that athletics at Brown are a drain on the University. But an examination of the alumni base at Brown will demonstrate many success stories of students who were passionate about, and talented in, non-academic endeavors. Examples include John Krasinski ’01, Emma Watson ’14, John Heisman and Chris Berman ’77 P ’08 P ’09— to name a few. There are even the stories of successful student-athletes at Brown who went on to achieve beyond the athletic realm, stepping into television, music and beyond (for example, Daveed Diggs ’04).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If one wants to make the argument that athletic outlays should plateau and not increase in this age of the shrinking budget and evolving goals of the modern university, I can begrudgingly concede to that middle ground. But there is no world in which I can see Brown benefiting from decreased support for athletics. Do national championships in crew not count as athletic “success”? Does reaching the Final Four in lacrosse not meet the standard that an Ivy League institution should set for athletic prowess?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a former student-athlete at Brown and proud graduate, I am slightly offended that the four years my teammates and I committed to Brown go unappreciated by non-athletes. The countless hours we devoted to both our sports and academics — with many of us attending graduate school as University record holders, Ivy League finalists, and NCAA qualifiers — seem to be in vain, as we are not viewed in the eyes of some as even deserving our initial acceptance to Brown. I will continue to advocate for Brown athletics, and I would ask that non-student-athletes respect, or at least recognize, the sacrifice that student-athletes make every day to represent the brown, cardinal and white. We student-athletes are Ever True, are you?</span></p>

		<title>Malin-Mayor &#039;17: Demanding respect for women in intramural sports</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, I played in an intramural soccer game in which I was the only woman playing. When I walked into the gym and saw four or five extremely tall, muscular men warming up on the other side of the field, I was a little intimidated. As a 5-foot-3-inch, 140-pound woman, I wasn’t keen to go into tackles against men twice my size. Compounding the physical risk of injury is the fact that every time I step onto the field to play coed soccer, I am cognizant of being “the girl.” That feeling only gets worse when the size disparity between me and everyone else is huge. Unfortunately, most athletic spaces at Brown are profoundly unwelcoming for women.

A couple of minutes after the whistle blew, signaling the start of the game, I played a nice volley. One opponent looked at me with a surprised expression and said something like, “Wow, you have skills!” This type of shocked compliment happens in at least half of the coed games I play in, and it never fails to insult me. I have never once heard a player compliment a male opponent with such surprise. Clearly, many opponents expect me to be bad simply because I am a girl.

The first half proceeded — we scored first, and our opponents followed up with a goal of their own. We were more skilled, but they used their size and strength to their advantage. Just before halftime, they scored a second goal, and my team’s competitive drive kicked in. The intensity of the game started to ratchet up, with more and more physical play. At one point, when I was trying to defend an opponent who was around 6-feet-8-inches, he pushed out his arm. I skidded three feet and almost fell. After that, I made sure to brace myself and go into every tackle with my entire body. Any soccer player can tell you that tackling halfheartedly leads to injury, and going in 100 percent is self-preservation when playing against people so much larger than me.

The whistle blew for halftime, and my team gathered to regroup and strategize. On my way back from getting water, the opponent that almost pushed me over approached me and said out of the blue, “You can’t be both nice and cute.” Taken aback and pretty sure I had heard him wrong, I reply, “Yes, I can.” Still processing his statement, I listened mutely while he amended that maybe I’m not nice after all, with the way that I was pushing him in the first half. I’m not sure what happened next. Before I turned around and walked away from him, I may have sputtered something about him being 12 feet tall and me literally bouncing off of him when trying to tackle him during the game. Thinking back on it, there are so many things that I wish I had said. So I am going to say them now, to all the guys I play soccer with.

I don’t play soccer to find a man. I don’t want to flirt with you. I just want to have fun playing the sport that I love. Athletic culture is male-centric, and every time I step on the field with guys I feel like I don’t belong. Calling me diminutive words like “nice” and “cute” and flirting with me in this space tells me that I am just a nice, cute woman, not a fierce athlete and a worthy opponent or teammate. That said, there is an obvious physical difference between my stature and yours. In a pick-up or intramural game, there is no reason for you to overpower me just because you can. I want you to respect me and play against me like you would any other opponent who is smaller than you, without any extra force or flirting.

Toward the end of the game, we pushed extra attackers forward. They scored on the counterattack before we got a goal back, making the score three to two. Hoping to tie it up, I subbed in for the goalie to join in on the offense when we got the ball. The same opponent who flirted with me at halftime saw me in the goal and screamed to his team, “Everyone shoot!” clearly expecting me to fail. Angry, I made eye contact with him and asked, “Why, cause I’m a girl?” He didn’t reply. Until I made a save, that is, and he told me, “You got lucky.”

I don’t care that we lost the game. I care that coed sporting spaces at Brown are still so male-dominated, that just by being a woman I feel threatened every time I step onto the field. I hate that I have to prove that I belong in a game, when any man has that privilege by default, and that some call me “lucky” because they can’t admit that I am good. I wish that opponents would see me as an athlete, not as a woman and thus a sexual object. I am sad that my athletic female friends refuse to play intramural sports because they expect injuries and disrespectful treatment.

I refuse to let these barriers keep me from playing the sport that I love. If I think about them too much, I can’t enjoy myself, so I usually ignore the unequal treatment and focus on having fun. But sometimes, like that night, my joy in the game is overpowered by anger and pain. So I ask you, on the soccer field, to treat me like you would anyone else. Because I can be nice and powerful, cute and skilled, a woman and an athlete. I won’t let anyone tell me otherwise.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Several years ago, Brown engaged famous author-illustrator David Macaulay to chronicle Brown’s historic campus. Macaulay’s tour resulted in a brilliant film entitled “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrXGlIdvDtw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown: A Sense of Place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Among his reflections was the importance of Brown’s smaller buildings. Macaulay states, “They are, in a curious way, the glory of the Brown campus. They move like currents … giving Brown a texture held together by the streetscape.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowhere is this assessment more evident than along the northern edge of Waterman Street, where the vista stretches from Prospect Street (with the exception of J. Walter Wilson) to Thayer Street. All who traverse this section of campus are rewarded with an unending array of architectural delights, a veritable trip back in time to a long-ago era of horse-drawn conveyances. Next to the Walk between main campus and Pembroke, Norwood House (82 Waterman St.) and the unique brick house (86 Waterman St.) share a small green park, a welcome oasis for relaxation and contemplation under a magnificent shade tree. How ironic that this gem — named (at least on campus maps) for Mary Elizabeth Sharpe, who in the 1940s volunteered her time and expertise to beautify the campus with trees, gardens and green spaces — might soon disappear.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As Brown moves closer to the creation of a long-awaited performing arts center, it is important that the leadership carefully examines the proposed building's impact on the people and structures that occupy the proposed site west of the Walk. Each of the five buildings — all of which date to the mid-19th century — contribute to the charm, livability and sense of belonging enjoyed by everyone on College Hill.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Waterman Street trio need to be preserved intact. Eliminating them would create a historic void, a gash which could not be filled by the butt end of a new structure, regardless of how creative the performing arts center architects might be in filling the empty space. Saving them would make it difficult to fulfill the space requirements for the center, but alternatives such as creating underground spaces for practice rooms and even encroaching on the Walk itself could be considered to preserve the historical structures of the area.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the north end of the site sit historic side-by-side Greek Revival houses on Angell Street. Built in the mid-1800s, they are the last survivors of a neighborhood. Like the brick apartment building on Waterman Street, they traditionally house graduate students. Given Brown’s acknowledged lack of graduate student housing, it seems counterproductive to lose any of them, so Brown could instead move the Angell Street houses. The larger one could be relocated the short distance to the parking lot on the northwest corner of Brown and Olive Streets. The smaller one might take a longer trip up Brown Street, to where the University </span><a href="http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/Building_Brown/resources/Institutional_Master_Plan_2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to build</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new Brown-to-Brown house at 181 Bowen St., near the corner of Brown Street and Bowen Street.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also supreme irony in the case of 129 Angell St. Before Brown acquired it, the owner's family lost their George Street home in connection with the massive land clearing for the Wriston Quadrangle in the early 1950s. This owner vowed never to let Brown own her home, but despite her legal mandate, it ultimately fell into Brown’s hands, </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2008/05/14/former-129-angell-st-owner-mistrusted-university/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Herald previously reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2009, when Brown was considering construction of a Mind Brain Behavior building on the Walk site, the two Angell Street houses were </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2009/01/26/u-gets-90-offers-for-cheap-angell-st-houses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offered for sale at $10 each</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, plus up to $1 million to help defray moving costs. Now nearly a decade later, their reprieve seems near its end. Brown should either move them or guarantee they will be sold and moved by a buyer in order to preserve them on the East Side. Demolition should not be an option.</span>

Finally, the question of the Urban Environmental Lab remains the most difficult and painful. This 1885 converted carriage house sits in the center of the plat and is simply too large to relocate. Regrettably, it will become the sacrificial lamb. Though it is unique and irreplaceable, the hope is that Brown will offer alternatives to all of the various components and groups who have made the UEL such a valued part of Brown history.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before plans for the performing arts center are finalized, my hope is that Brown will reflect carefully on its architectural inheritance and honor its obligation to history. As Brown alum and former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes said in his Commencement speech in 1937, “It is always Old Brown and it is always New Brown.” Let’s have both!</span>

		<title>Bustos &#039;16: Contested claims</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a former high school and college student, I was privileged to visit the land at 300 Tower Street in Bristol many times. Every summer, the University hosts the Brown Environmental Leadership Lab, a two-week program for high school students. In 2011, I was a BELL student, and, in 2013, I worked as a leader fellow. Afterward, I continued to visit the property until graduation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During the program, we slept in tents, walked around the site, talked about climate change and learned about the history of the land. A lesson on Native history was one of the most enriching experiences of the summer. We discussed <a href="https://www.ecori.org/social-justice-archive/2017/8/28/pokanocket-tribe-occupies-brown-university-land">the transformations</a> the property had experienced, the systematic dispossession of the Wampanoags and the turning points during King Philip’s War. We even walked in silence to the spot where King Philip (also known as Metacom) had been killed. As occupiers of land that underwent processes of dispossession and settler colonialism, we students — and for that matter, most of the public — had much to learn about the histories that have been deliberately erased.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My memories of the property are colored with emotion and even nostalgia. It was here where I made a decision to pursue environmental studies, where I first thought that Brown could one day be home, a place where I ran miles lost in my own thoughts. So when I first heard about the Pokanoket Nation occupying the 375-acre land where I had spent many summer days, my immediate reaction was confusion. Why were there tents and boards all over the familiar landscape? Why were the Pokanoket claiming ownership of the property if Brown had held a legal title for decades? Hadn’t the University sustained or at least attempted to maintain friendly relationships with several Wampanoag tribes and even facilitated access to their spiritual visits every year?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As I began to read more about the context behind the claims and the contrasting statements between Brown and Pokanoket leadership, I was struck by the complexity of the issue. This was not just about occupying space in an act of defiance but about the implications of indigenous identity on land claims, notions of justice and stewardship. These concepts are inherently complicated, interconnected and far-reaching — as are several key questions behind this situation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First, there was the issue of self-identification and federal recognition. A specific piece of the University’s statement stirred some controversy: “There is a delicate yet important technical difference between holding Native ancestry and holding nation status, and that is at the heart of the issue here.” But so what if the Pokanoket were not federally recognized? Of course this recognition has substantial legal implications, but what about the right to self-identification, which is in itself enshrined in international human rights law? Different interpretations of the notion of self-determination, in <a href="https://www.dejusticia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fi_name_recurso_558.pdf">Paraguay for example</a>, argue that neither courts nor states can determine the ethnic identity of a community, respecting the right to autonomy and self-determination. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that “indigenous peoples have the right to determine their own identity or membership in accordance with their customs and traditions.” With this in mind, whether or not the group had federal recognition should not hinder a fair and responsive exchange. Though Brown’s response was more complex than this, the federal recognition statement only raised further questions for me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Second, beyond the claim to the land, what else could reparations to historical exclusion and dispossession entail? For several decades, Brown has been in the process of coming to terms with its own involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. As a result, it has created the Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice, installed a Slavery Memorial and pursued other ways to understand and recognize the past. What would a parallel process for reparations to other ethnic communities look like? Assistant Professor of American Studies and Ethnic Studies Adrienne Keene <a href="http://nativeappropriations.com/2017/08/the-pokanoket-encampment-in-bristol-ri.html">has discussed</a> some of the steps the University has already taken. But if Brown eventually reaches an agreement with the indigenous groups in the area, what would that mean for broader processes of collective reparation? Furthermore, if all the land we currently occupy has a nuanced history of dispossession and exclusion, what happens to the rest of the properties where so many other people have laid roots and built livelihoods? Even if there was an agreement with the Pokanoket and the other tribes with claims to the land, what would the implications be?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Third, while Brown makes a valid point when it says that other Wampanoag peoples like the Aquinnah, Mashpee, Assonet, Herring Pond Wampanoag and Narragansett need to be involved in any negotiation, part of me wondered whether Brown was also trying to capitalize on <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/06/20/tribes-oppose-mashpee-wampanoag-casino-plan-for-taunton/v9uvNVFvMFsm2CkUN9rOnN/story.html">existing tensions</a> between these groups to defend its own interests. I fully agree with the need to hold discussions with all the relevant stakeholders, but this claim struck me as an effort to dilute the main sources of tension.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fourth, as Brown explains in a <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/08/statement-0831">recent press release</a>, I am puzzled by the Pokanoket’s refusal to recognize the connection of other groups to the land. Perhaps this is where my lack of expertise on the subject matter fails me, but how can they be so certain of their claim as the only valid one? When the sources of Native history are closely linked to oral tradition, how do we reconcile conflicting versions of the “truth”?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As an outsider, I do not pretend to hold any definitive answers to the questions I have raised. If anything, the past days have reminded me of how little we know about the histories of the land we now occupy. Even as someone who had spent time and was acquainted with the history of the Bristol site, I still find myself perplexed by the complexity and nuances of the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As many of my peers, my immediate reaction was to express solidarity with the Pokanoket and their claims. Now, as we await statements from the other Wampanoag peoples with spiritual and material ties to the land, I invite careful reflection on this moment. Beyond an intricate land dispute between a number of stakeholders, this case is also an opportunity to think critically about how we understand contested land claims, identities and processes of collective reparation. What is at stake here and what is being negotiated goes beyond this particular case in Bristol, Rhode Island. We must acknowledge the complexity of spiritual and ethnic claims to the land even when our legal systems do not.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As someone who cherishes the memories and the time spent in 300 Tower Road, Bristol, I hope the land remains accessible to anyone who wishes to teach, learn or walk on it. And at the same time, I hope that — whatever legal, symbolic or ethical battles are fought over it — considerations of justice, environmental stewardship and public interest are part of the picture.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Aug. 29, First Lady Melania Trump grabbed the national spotlight by opting to wear stilettos before departing to survey the damage wrought by Hurricane Harvey. Though she changed into tennis shoes upon arrival, the image of a luxury shoe-clad first lady preparing to greet Texans who had lost everything sparked a social media storm and spawned countless think pieces. How could Trump flaunt her wealth in the midst of a natural disaster deemed “unprecedented” by the National Weather Service? To her critics, this fashion choice epitomized a first family utterly out of touch with the American people and illustrated the new political lows to which our country has sunk.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I, too, considered the situation in Texas through a political lens at first. The hurricane’s severity provided evidence for the perils of climate change. The Houston metropolitan area’s susceptibility to flooding spoke to the dangers of urban sprawl and poor city planning. The numerous Latinx immigrants whose life savings had been wiped out by Harvey highlighted the need for more inclusive immigration policy and rhetoric. As I have continued to follow coverage of the storm, though, these political questions seem increasingly disconnected from the experience of those fighting to survive on the ground. In these near-apocalyptic circumstances, there is no room for the hyper-partisanship that has paralyzed the rest of the country.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While recent political discourse often casts doubt on Americans’ willingness to stick together, the response to Harvey’s destruction has proven otherwise, at least when it’s a matter of life and death. According to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, officials were concerned first with “rescuing every person we can find.” Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement stated that immigration status would not be considered for admittance to emergency shelters. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, promised to defend any immigrant facing deportation after seeking shelter. For Democrats and Republicans alike, the protection of life became the sole priority, even in the state at the center of the divisive national debate on immigration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now that the storm has passed, the commitment of government officials from both sides of the aisle to facilitate the grueling rebuilding process speaks to the extraordinary nature of the situation. The White House has requested more than $7 billion in initial aid from Congress, and President Trump is no longer threatening to shut down the government if he does not receive funding for the border wall. Lawmakers from New York and New Jersey have promised to support an aid package despite the fact that their Texan colleagues refused to back relief for Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, encouraged Rhode Islanders to donate to help those affected by Harvey, and Rhode Island Air National Guard troops flew to Texas to pitch in.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beyond the robust response of high-level officials and the military, the bravery of Americans springing into action to provide help has been heartening. Boat owners from Texas and other states have assisted in rescuing those trapped by the rapidly rising floodwaters. The Austin Independent School District said that students forced to abandon their homes were welcome to enroll in Austin schools. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been donated to Harvey relief efforts by businesses and individuals across the country. Any animus people may hold toward one another on issues such as gun control and racial justice seems to have been put on hold by the four feet of rain Harvey dumped on southeast Texas.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, the numerous displays of bipartisan goodwill churned up by the hurricane do not erase the reality of political polarization. Even as Houston residents are returning home to take stock of what little remains, President Trump has reportedly chosen to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. It is clear, then, that the president has no intention of backing down from his aggressive immigration agenda, despite the temporary concessions made during Harvey. And the lessons offered by the hurricane on issues such as climate change and urban planning must be considered critically as the floodwaters recede. As life slowly returns to normal, it is natural that political disagreements will return, too.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the apparent intractability of the partisan divide, the commitment of Americans from both parties and in every state to support the victims of Hurricane Harvey demonstrates the country’s as-yet-untapped potential to come together. The devastating circumstances of a natural disaster remind us of what we share in common: a fierce will to survive and, even more importantly, to help others. Indeed, it would be a shame to reserve this understanding of our shared humanity solely for use during catastrophic events. Perhaps we can find a way to reach out to our neighbors in good times, too — not just when they’re waist-deep in the rising waters, waiting to be rescued.</span></p>

		<title>Burt ’19: The undeniable politics of non-profits</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Black L--lives Mmmatter,” read one of my students, sounding out a sign I had hung in our room at Providence CityArts for Youth, a nonprofit arts organization where I taught classes this summer. “Miss Marielle, what does that mean?” she asked. “It means the police are shooting us and Trump says it’s okay,” her best friend, another 9-year-old girl of color, responded. This prompted the three of us to have a frank conversation about race in the United States and how they might resist police violence and President Trump’s racist policies through their art. This conversation — which felt like one of my most important teaching moments — might, strictly speaking, have been in violation of the contract I signed when I took this job.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This episode highlights a major critique of nonprofit organizations, such as CityArts. Nonprofits, as the title implies, generally do not make money from the services they provide. Instead, they depend on outside funders — donors, private grant programs, government-sponsored grants or some combination of the three — to cover their operating costs. But many of these funders, particularly those with government ties, aim to steer clear of politics in order to protect their reputations from shifts in political power. This forces organizations that engage with social politics to negotiate the disparity between the political implications of their work on the one hand and the pressure from funders to be apolitical and follow strict funding guidelines on the other.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">CityArts is one of many nonprofits forced to toe this line. It is in many ways an incredible organization. It runs free afterschool arts programs and summer camps for Providence youth, with a focus on integrating social justice and arts education. The teaching artists demonstrate a depth of knowledge in their particular art disciplines and are trained to guide students to think critically about social issues so they can express their individual values through art. Though the diversity of the management team is somewhat lacking — the company is run predominantly by young, white women — they seem dedicated to their work and demonstrate genuine care for the youth they serve. CityArts’ main campus in South Providence is stunning: Its hallways are decorated with colorful murals and mosaics made by young artists. The studio spaces have large windows and are stocked with high-quality art supplies, including pottery wheels, several dozen Mac computers, 3-D printers, video cameras and a large collection of painting, sculpting and collaging materials.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To maintain these programs and resources, CityArts partners with various funders including AmeriCorps, a federal service organization often described as the domestic version of the Peace Corps. Troublingly, the values of AmeriCorps do not align with CityArts’ mission. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/08/americorps-vista-shutdown_n_4060311.html">AmeriCorps</a> allows their members to be paid less than minimum wage, with the apparent justification that community workers should be in the same economic bracket as the people they serve. In other words, AmeriCorps believes you must live in poverty to serve people in poverty. This illogical rationale not only takes advantage of the labor of AmeriCorps members, but also contributes to the exclusivity of AmeriCorps programs. Folks who work for AmeriCorps overwhelmingly depend on another source of income — often, wealthy parents — while members without this support must work two jobs. (I can attest that my stipends from CityArts, that followed AmeriCorps’ guidelines, were barely enough to cover my rent for summer housing.)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While CityArts claims to prioritize diversity and equality, by accepting AmeriCorps subminimum wage stipends for their teaching artists, the organization discourages low-income folks from applying for this position. CityArts teaches young people that art is a valuable tool for social change but hypocritically devalues social justice artists by failing to pay its teachers a living wage.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Beyond the issue of wages, AmeriCorps’ strictly apolitical stance conflicts with CityArts’ commitment to social justice. In a training with an AmeriCorps representative, the summer teaching artists were told not to promote or denounce any political party or candidate. My cohort of liberal teaching artists was quick to question this instruction, particularly after the week of trainings we had just completed on how to engage students in political critique through art. In our political climate, we asked, where Republican leaders defend neo-Nazis, enact racist, xenophobic and transphobic legislation and work to strip low-income folks of their healthcare coverage, how can we possibly teach social justice without talking about politics? Tripping over her words, the AmeriCorps representative attempted to draw a line between political candidates and topics with political relevance. Her response, like any attempt to remain neutral with Trump as our president, came across as an attempt to exculpate politicians from their influence on broader culture.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After this contentious training, the CityArts staff reassured the teaching artists that they still valued our individual commitments to social justice and that politics are indeed inherent to this work. Yet we all signed a form acknowledging that violating AmeriCorps’ apolitical stance could be grounds for termination. Ultimately, we as teachers, not CityArts, bore the risk of bending AmeriCorps’ rules.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I do not blame CityArts for its partnership with AmeriCorps, a partnership without which they would not be able to run any of their phenomenal arts programs. But the conflict between the missions of these two organizations sheds light on certain systemic issues of the nonprofit world. First of all, labor in service of others deserves a fair salary; the work is exhausting, intense and performed by people who, as much as they care for the communities they serve, still have rent checks to pay and meals to buy. Moreover, it is time to recognize that community-centered work is inherently political. Folks who are working to ameliorate any problem in the United States, be it social, economic or environmental, are ultimately working to make up for government failure. As conservative politicians strip rights from Americans who are not white, middle class or wealthy men, the political aspect of working with underserved communities is all the more apparent. When organizations ignore the political nature of this work, they turn a blind eye to the structural causes of injustice.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When I traveled to Berlin with my family last month, my mom was so worried about violating German laws prohibiting Nazi symbols that she taped over the swastikas on the cover of her copy of “In the Garden of Beasts.” Imagine the effect, then, of passing by a stand of German newspapers bearing the faces of men wearing Nazi armbands and proudly displaying the swastika — and knowing they were American faces.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The American Nazis that marched in Charlottesville and what they stand for have been voraciously documented in the media, both in the United States and abroad. They seek a nation in which white, Christian men possess the entirety of power — political, social, and economic — while the rest of us cower in a state between disenfranchisement and terror. The monuments they defend as “history” represented much more than a commemoration of the past. Strategically placed as weapons of intimidation against a generation of African-Americans seeking the most basic rights, these statues were never meant to be historical at all. Instead, they send a message to people of color that rings as clearly in 2017 as it did in 1920 and 1960: You will never be safe here, and you will never be one of us. For proof, look no further than the words of a Georgia state representative who suggested that anyone who tried to dismantle the statues would be met with “something a lot more definitive” than torches by his constituents .</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">American Nazis are aghast at the thought of suppressing our history, by which they mean Confederate generals and their supposed honor in committing treason. As a nation, we’re very good at commemorating the Civil War and its soldiers. Its battlefields are major tourist attractions, re-enactments occur across the nation, and an almost unimaginable amount of literature and media is still produced to tell the story of a war that ended 152 years ago. We’re much worse at discussing the cause of the Civil War (which, no, was not “states’ rights”). And when we do talk about slavery, or segregation or Jim Crow laws, we tend to do so in a way that obscures their relevance to our everyday lives instead of confronting their ongoing manifestations and lasting harm.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This inability to address the racial injustice that has been a part of America since its beginning is shameful, and it is destroying us. But if we’re serious about rethinking the way we grapple with the legacy and reality of racism, there is hope. In Berlin, it occurred to me that I was watching the events in Charlottesville unfold from perhaps the only nation on earth that can teach us how to rid ourselves of our own Nazi scourge and come to terms, at long last, with the hate and cruelty that underlie our past.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In German, there are two words for “memorial”: Denkmal, derived from the word for “think,” and Ehrenmal, from the word for “honor.” Some of the many memorials throughout Berlin are Ehrenmäler, like the memorial to fallen Red Army soldiers that the Soviets built immediately after occupying the city. It towers over former West Berlin like a Communist postcard. But most of the memorials that reflect Germany’s darkest era are Denkmäler, designed not to celebrate, but to provoke reflection. Walking through Berlin, it’s impossible not to feel the double burden of the city’s evil history: the weight of what happened there and the weight of the reckoning. The story of Germany today is the story of a nation still grappling with its actions, forcing you to remember them, even trip over them. The streets are dotted with brass placards — Stolpersteine, stumbling stones — marking the spot where Jewish Berliners lived or worked before they fell victim to the Nazis. Once confined to Berlin, these stumbling stones can now be found all over Europe, making up the largest decentralized memorial in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Similarly, in 1993 in Bayerischer Platz, a prosperous Jewish area before the war, a pair of artists hung signs that reflected laws and ordinances the Nazis passed against Jews: “Jews are no longer allowed to keep pets.” “Aryan and non-Aryan children are not allowed to play together.” Some residents of the neighborhood promptly called the police, mistaking the Denkmal for neo-Nazi vandalism. The misunderstanding was cleared up, and the signs remain as a poignant and haunting memorial today. Compare that to America, where monuments like statues can glorify the past and obscure its darker moments to a point where we consider them something worth celebrating. But in Germany, Denkmäler remembrances like this force observers to confront the realities of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Contrary to the strawman arguments I’ve read over the past weeks, I don’t think we should erase history. I don’t think we could even if we wanted to. We can’t escape our hateful past. The vestiges of slavery and Jim Crow linger in our criminal justice system, in our halls of power and in our segregated neighborhoods and schools. If we’re going to erase history, we should start there. But when it comes to the much harder process of remembering, confronting and building a path toward healing, we must learn how to memorialize without honoring, how to honestly confront the past and absorb the pain it caused. Monuments and memorials aren’t about the past; they’re lenses through which we view the present. We have too many Ehrenmäler for men who tried to destroy the Union and not nearly enough Denkmäler for the crimes on which that same Union was built. It is only through the most twisted of ironies that we find ourselves facing Nazis in Virginia because of a failure to act more like Germany. We know the consequences of allowing hate to fester under the surface, only coming to our attention under the light of tiki torches. It is time to bring it into the light ourselves, so that it can be extinguished once and for all.</span></p>

		<title>Slade ’20: Reconstructing fatness</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/10/slade-20-reconstructing-fatness/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2017 02:55:06 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Mathew Slade]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.browndailyherald.com/?p=2826546</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Growing up fat, I learned 1,000 ways to make myself smaller. Yes, to run in the mornings, to side-eye sweets, to eat my vegetables. But it was not just about losing weight. I learned to avoid situations where my body might garner unwanted attention. I spent my time in the back or corners of rooms. I spoke softly, walked quickly from place to place and opted to stand inconspicuously by a wall even when sitting in a chair was a reasonable option. The constant awareness that I was taking up too much space — space that belonged to other people — tailored my movement and mannerisms to make me into the perfect fat person: quiet, undemanding, out of view and complicit in my own censorship. I afforded others the courtesy of not reminding them that fat people existed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When I arrived at campus last fall, this hadn’t changed. In fact, my fear intensified as I considered the logistics of showering in a public space and eating food in front of others, as I realized that I didn’t always fit into the desks and chairs provided and that I wouldn’t be able to hide myself as I had done previously. At Brown, I constantly dread encountering or returning to a space that cannot accommodate my body. I am scared, always, of not only being in such a space, but also of being unable to adjust the situation to divert attention away from my body. The worry that I will draw too much attention to my fatness — the fatness that I feel is eternally reviled and judged — is always there. While the physical aspects of this inaccessibility are important to address, the cultural component is just as vital to our health and well-being as students at Brown. Reinventing the culture surrounding fatness costs no money and no logistical restructuring, only mindfulness and a willingness to question what we’ve been taught.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The repulsion to fat bodies is fluid and impermanent, dependent upon the current social landscape. Fat people are reminded constantly that we are fit for little more than the cruel character archetypes we see on television. We are the class clowns. We are the Disney villains. We are the sidekicks. We are the face of the corpulent, greedy, gluttonous analogy for those who love money and power too much. We are the “before” and never the “after.” We are caricatures for unpopular politicians. We are hedonistic, reckless, two-dimensional, and we exist only as comedic devices or beasts to ignore uncomfortably. Yet the truth is that fatness is not monolithic, neither in appearance nor in spirit. Fatness is diverse, and fat people who embody these stereotypes do exist. But we are wronged when we are forced into these archetypes and not allowed the complexity afforded to people who are not fat. There are infinite ways to live as a fat person, and there is no one way to become fat, let alone one way that merits the shame and disgust imposed upon us.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fat loneliness is pervasive, insidious and deeply familiar. Fat people are dehumanized and desexualized, much preferred unseen, unheard and removed from romantic and sexual contexts. As one might suspect, these slights on our humanity and self-expression, alongside our trepidation in navigating the campus, at such a critical juncture in our lives do nothing but harm us socially, academically and often physically. The omnipresent and oft-unspoken belief, even here, is that fat people cannot be trusted with full autonomy, for if we cannot be trusted with our bodies, how can we be trusted to act correctly in other situations? The distaste for us is assumed, if not explicit. For us, it has become increasingly obvious that most objections to our appearance or lifestyle come not from a place of concern for our health, but rather offense to the notion that we do not exist in a way that most have been taught to find aesthetically pleasing or even generally acceptable. It is this barrier, along with our physical ones, that keeps us from complete academic fairness, and it is the unwillingness of others to question internal biases that deprives us of the love and respect of which we are just as deserving as anyone else.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our fatness, however, does not exist in a vacuum. It is not an aspect isolated from prejudice and social justice. Our fatness exists in the racialized fetishization of black and brown women. It exists in the intra-community devaluation of fat gay men. It exists in the withholding of independence from fat disabled people. It exists in multiplicity and it exists largely because our society allows it. It is far more comfortable to view fatness as a character defect rather than to confront one’s prejudice and consider that it may in fact be tied to more striking systems of disenfranchisement. Objection to fatness is often quiet and, at face value, often seems justified. There is a cycle of doubt particular to fatness that forces us to question our self-advocacy: Am I the one who’s wrong? Do I have the right to complain about the seat sizes? Does my existence normalize unhealthiness? Am I really worthy of the love and acceptance that I claimed I was? It is this downward spiral that propels us back into our fear, our loneliness, our self-loathing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thus comes the time to examine myself — the time to question my own self-censorship, my desperate need to play roles I do not fit, my hesitation to express that I have inherent worth. To exist unapologetically as a fat person, to promote self-love and self-acceptance, is to exist bravely. It is imperative to reclaim my right to space — not more space than others, but enough space to exist freely, the space that others are granted and the space that fat people fearfully avoid. Part of this rests on the shoulders of fat people to leave the safety of silence and take up self-advocacy. Another part requires the effort of our peers, an effort to reevaluate their understanding of fatness and the ways they may perpetuate a culture that damages us. This, currently, is my hope for Brown: for us to be mindful of fatness and the ways we interact with it. It is one step of many in the commitment to social justice, a step that helps our campus become as safe, enriching and just as possible.</span></p>

		<title>Fernandez ’21: A colony in crisis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Sept. 20 Puerto Rico was hit by category four hurricane María and has been struggling to survive ever since. Residents of the island face hours of long lines for food and fuel, and only 45 percent of the population has access to potable water in their residencies. The hurricane, along with the consequent flooding, destroyed homes and decimated infrastructure, in addition to wiping out over 80 percent of the island’s crop value, exacerbating the prospect of food shortages. The majority of Puerto Rico is still without power, and its hospitals are struggling to provide care without access to electricity. Cell phone service is still scarce and communication is limited, providing an additional obstacle to the already complicated rescue and relief efforts. The death toll has officially risen to 45, but this is a number that is expected to rise substantially as officials have not had the resources to account for many of the victims and much of the population is still living under highly precarious circumstances. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Despite the fact that the situation has been documented as a disaster threatening the health, safety and well-being of 3.4 million people, it has consistently been ignored by those with the power to make a real impact. The situation in Puerto Rico post-Hurricane María is a humanitarian crisis that has served to further highlight the injustices and the unsustainability of Puerto Rico’s current economic and political status. The devastated island is being held responsible for the burden of recovery, yet has historically been denied the right to the very mechanisms of self-sustainability and self-determination that would make it possible to achieve such a trying task in the first place. Indeed, Puerto Rico’s crisis did not begin when María hit the coast.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As members of an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Ricans are essentially treated like second-class citizens, a fact that has been made increasingly clear by the reactions of Americans to the island’s current circumstances. Puerto Ricans have no representation in Congress and have no electoral votes, despite the fact that their policies are completely subject to American approval. The island is currently $72 billion in debt that has been accumulated, at least to some extent, by a complicated economic relationship with the United States. Economic limitations placed on the island have made the cost of living greater in Puerto Rico than in many regions in the United States, and yet the average income in Puerto Rico is almost half that of Mississippi, the poorest state. To this we must now add the expenses related to reconstruction. The island of Puerto Rico has been subjected to colonial exploitation for all of its history. Furthermore, it is truly unacceptable that even in the midst of such a devastating catastrophe, this fact has yet to come to light in the public and in the political sphere. The issue of Puerto Rico’s colonial status has been hidden behind political jargon such as “unincorporated territory” and “commonwealth,” contributing to an uninformed public that is highly unsympathetic with the dilemma. This is highlighted by recent research that has shown that only roughly 60 percent of Americans know that Puerto Ricans are U.S citizens. Furthermore, those who were unaware of this fact were much less likely to agree with the premise that the U.S. government should provide aid to the island. Now more than ever, the public needs to recognize that Puerto Ricans are American citizens, that this status was imposed on them and that U.S. policymakers must assume the responsibility that this imposition entails by providing aid during the island’s time of need. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is understandable that these issues can seem incredibly distant and that grasping such levels of destruction is extremely difficult for all of us. However, it is important to remember that these matters hit very close to home for so many in the Brown community with connections to Puerto Rico and all of the other areas in the region that have also suffered greatly. As members of the Brown community, each and every one of us has certain responsibilities in regard to how we respond to such situations, the first of which is to support those who have been affected. We should also participate in the efforts that are already taking place to send aid to Puerto Rico throughout campus and the Providence area. Most importantly, however, we must acknowledge that the way the Trump administration has reacted to the disaster has been completely unacceptable and is disrespectful on a fundamental level to Puerto Ricans, not only as American citizens, but also as human beings. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We must understand that efforts cannot cease when the power is restored or when homes are rebuilt. There are so many other layers of crisis that need to be unmasked and addressed if Puerto Rico is ever to get back on its feet. The injustices perpetrated by the American political structure have serious implications for anyone living in the United States, regardless of their affiliation with Puerto Rico. These implications should resonate with anyone who no longer wants to exist within a structure that so blatantly continues to reap the benefits of colonialism and should push all of us to stand up for those who don’t have a voice or a vote; they should push us to reject the tempting pitfalls of indifference. The goal should not be solely to rebuild what has been lost, but to create something new that will allow Puerto Rico to regain national, economic and political dignity. </span></p>

		<title>Raimondo: Cutting the cost of college textbooks</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/19/raimondo-cutting-cost-college-textbooks/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This past summer, I met a mom in southern Rhode Island. She was dressed for work, and her kids were about the same age as my son, Tommy. We started talking. She told me about how she dropped out of high school when she got pregnant, then later earned her GED. She worked a few different jobs at deli counters for various grocery store chains, but had trouble supporting her family on the hourly wages they paid. So she enrolled at Rhode Island College and eventually got her degree.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thanks to that degree, she told me, “I finally have a real job.” She works at an accounting firm full-time. And she told me to keep investing in education. “I’m living proof of the power of a degree,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I hear stories like hers from Rhode Islanders everywhere I go. It’s more important than ever to have some kind of education or credential past a high school degree. By 2025, it’s estimated that 70 percent of jobs in Rhode Island will require post-secondary education. But, according to our state Department of Labor and Training, less than 45 percent of Rhode Islanders have that right now.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We know that most high school students want to go to college. Every year, the R.I. Department of Education surveys seniors graduating from high school. About 90 percent say they want to go to college, but only 65 percent actually do. The number one reason students cite for not going? Money.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As governor, that’s a red flag to me. We need to do more to help students succeed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Over the past two and a half years, we’ve made progress. We started offering the SAT and PSAT free of charge to every high school junior and senior. We expanded programs like the Advanced Coursework Network, which allows students to earn college credit for free while still in high school. And, with the passage of this year’s budget, we created the new Rhode Island Promise Scholarship, adding our name to the list of just four states in the nation offering free community college to our students. Already, more than 1,400 students have taken advantage of the scholarship at the Community College of Rhode Island, resulting in a more than 40 percent increase in enrollment since last year.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We need to attack the problem of college affordability from every angle. It’s not just the cost of courses or standardized tests that price students out of getting a degree — it’s also the cost of textbooks. That’s why last year, I launched the Rhode Island Open Textbook Initiative, challenging every college and university in the state to save students money by switching to free, openly-licensed textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The goal is to save college students $5 million over five years by supporting faculty in updating their syllabi and produce results. One year into the initiative, we can report over $870,000 in savings for over 6,000 Rhode Island students. And that number is still growing. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As students and faculty, there’s so much you can do to help. Brown hasn’t yet switched out any texts, but you can help us get there. So students: Talk to your administrators and professors. Let them know there are resources out there to support them in adopting open textbooks. Let them know how much this matters to you. And faculty: Talk to your librarians. Campuses across the state are hosting regular open textbook trainings, and every school has a trained librarian on staff who can help guide you to quality open resources in your subject matter. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is just the beginning. Together, we can lower the cost of higher education for everyone and increase opportunity for all.</span></p>

		<title>Samilow ’19: Protecting the First Amendment in the private sector</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Every so often, someone gets fired for political statements that their boss dislikes. Depending on whether or not you agreed with these statements, you’ll probably either bemoan the “decline of free speech” or just shrug that “no one is required to listen to speech they don’t like.” Right now, it is true that private companies can fire employees for any reason that is not prohibited by state or federal law. In a famous 2004 incident, Lynne Gobbell was <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123024596">dismissed</a> from her job for putting a John Kerry bumper sticker on her car. This summer, a Google engineer <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/08/08/the-google-memo-is-a-reminder-that-we-generally-dont-have-free-speech-at-work/?utm_term=.fcaf5f6ad2ab">learned</a> the hard way how perilously vulnerable his position was: He was fired for publishing a memo that argued the STEM gender-gap was partially due to biology. The First Amendment is a shield only against government retaliation, and just 7 percent of Americans are <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm">employed</a> by state, local or the federal government. The other 93 percent can be canned for pretty much anything other than attributes such as their race, religion or gender. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It would be ideal for companies to refrain — out of comity and good citizenship — from firing employees for beliefs that do not substantially impact their jobs. But this is not the era of comity and good citizenship. This is the era of online outrage and hyperpartisanship. And what’s more, no business would voluntarily expose itself to public backlash by tolerating unpopular speech. Legal coercion is needed to address this collective action problem. That’s why Congress and states should prohibit large companies from terminating employees for political expression unrelated to job performance. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Why hasn’t such a right been necessary before? Well for one, it’s never been so easy to broadcast your views far and wide. And it’s never been harder to take them back once you do so. Additionally, companies all have email addresses, Twitter accounts and Facebook pages. In the old days, it took honest labor to gin up a mob: People needed to grab pitchforks and torches and pour out into the public square. Now hordes of Twitter users can just kick back and flood a company with threatening or displeased messages until it caves. The modern dynamic of information transfer makes it easier for a lapse in judgment to carry lasting consequences and incite frenzied backlash. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Critics of this proposal would likely retort that it’s unfair to force companies to ignore public pressure and keep an employee — possibly incurring boycotts and lawsuits in the process. Two answers: First, all similarly-sized companies would have to abide by these laws, so the financial harms would be borne equally by everyone; second, public backlash would be milder and abate more quickly if people understood that the employee cannot be fired so easily. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Furthermore, there are two absolutely essential qualifiers. First, that the companies be “large,” since it would be problematic to require small firms to keep an employee with whom no one gets along. At a small business, broadcasting political views often will have an impact on the workplace dynamic since everyone interacts with each other daily. This is not the case at a company with hundreds or thousands of employees. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The second proviso is that the employee’s expression cannot impact their actual work. Certain forms of political expression can intrude upon job performance. Companies can make a convincing case that racially inflammatory speech damages the work environment and degrades amity among employees. But employers should have to offer some level of tangible and particularized evidence to a judge or jury that this is so. In the case of Lynne Gobbell, it’s <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2004/09/bumper_sticker_insubordination.html">implausible</a> to argue that her support for Kerry impacted her job performance, and the termination would likely be found wrongful under this system. In the James Damore incident, the tech giant could certainly make a serious case that his job did not permit him to circulate a manifesto to co-workers, and that its content makes it difficult for him to work with women at Google. But Damore could also make a serious case that it was political speech that did not impair his work as a software engineer nor limit his interaction with other employees. Ultimately, it would be up to a court to hear evidence and figure out who’s right. So at bottom, this legislation wouldn’t allow employees to say anything and keep their jobs, but would simply permit courts to review the termination and decide if it was wrongful. There’s an important deterrent factor at work, too. If employers knew that their workers could successfully litigate such a dispute, they would be hesitant in the first place to fire someone unless their statements had made it absolutely untenable to continue working together. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Overall, relatively few people have actually been fired simply for their political beliefs, which might make this discussion seem irrelevant or abstract. But that only means that most people either have indifferent or tolerant employers, or else are careful to keep their views private. Whatever detriments there are to this proposal — and there are many in addition to the ones I’ve pointed out — they are outweighed by the compelling public interest in promoting people’s ability to speak freely and avoid self-censorship.</span></p>

		<title>Steinman &#039;19: The EPA’s gag reflex</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A new report on the health of Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay shows that it is getting cleaner as a result of decades of investments in wastewater treatment and restrictions on harmful chemicals. Though scientists are continuing to monitor the effect that this reduced pollution is having on the ecosystem and on the shellfish, fish and sea grasses that call the bay home, early indications suggest it is getting healthier. Yet urban areas in Rhode Island are expanding, resulting in a loss of forested area and an increase in runoff and pollution. At the same time, climate change is warming the water and threatening the infrastructure that keeps it — and us — safe. And as always, more research is needed to completely understand the health of the bay at the risk posed by climate change.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">These five findings, the distilled overview of a 500-page technical <a href="http://nbep.org/the-state-of-our-watershed/">report</a>, are the result of a three-year, peer-reviewed research project by the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program and a variety of universities, organizations and agencies in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Yet despite its robustness and relevance — Narragansett Bay borders Providence and makes up the vast majority of the 33 percent of Rhode Island that is covered by <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/wetstates.html">water</a> — the report’s authors were forbidden to present its findings at a conference in Providence last Monday by the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/25/epa-pulls-speakers-conference/">EPA</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You can read the report online. You should read the report online, or at least the 28-page summary or the one-page overview of the <a href="http://nbep.org/the-state-of-our-watershed/summary-report/">summary</a>, mostly because anything Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt thinks is worth suppressing is probably worth reading. But if you do read it, you will immediately realize that this is not the type of subversive threat to national security one would generally associate with government censorship or a cover-up. In reality, it’s a wonky series of facts evaluating the health of one of New England’s major bodies of water, and its only call to action is continued vigilance. All Rhode Islanders — and indeed, all Americans and all humans — should have the right to access information like this to know if the ecosystem they live in will make them sick. When the Trump administration decides to hide this information from the public, to play down the importance of reports like these and to gag the authors who worked for years to bring them to light, they are actively endangering the people and land they were elected to protect.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Neil Degrasse Tyson, the celebrated astrophysicist, has a famous <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/03/11/neil_degrasse_tyson_science_is_true_whether_or_not_you_believe_in_it/">saying</a>: “The good thing about science (is) it’s true whether or not you believe in it.” In the case of climate change, that’s not a particularly good thing, but it holds true regardless. Climate change will continue to rage no matter how many climate deniers hold influential government posts. Pruitt and the Trump administration can stop scientists from presenting their work, but they can’t render their findings inaccurate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That’s not for lack of trying. President Trump, along with his supporters, seems to delight in telling the intellectuals of the world that they’re not as smart as they think they are. Whether staring at the eclipse or burying climate change research, Trump scores points with his base by deriding the data-driven analysts who think they have all the answers. As a result, science has become a lot less apolitical.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m not a scientist, but I can see the danger in allowing science to be co-opted by one political party and made to seem biased. Any society in which a segment of the population thinks science is working against them is in danger. And, of course, there are risks related to the politicization of science. In fact, no one is warier of the dangers of politicizing science than scientists themselves. When last <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/23/advocates-march-science-rhode-island/">April’s March for Science</a> brought over a million participants to the streets, protesting the administration’s war on facts, it also provoked a backlash from inside the scientific world (as well as outside), insisting that scientists should remain in the lab, leaving the policymaking up to the politicians. The environmentalist and activist Bill McKibben has been criticized similarly in the past, for transferring his environmental science expertise into activism. But in an age of gaslighting and fake news, the reliable scientific voice is one of the few sources of unbiased honesty we have left. How can we afford to silence that?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m not calling for all environmental scientists and ecologists to leave the lab and run for office, or for them to start drafting legislation. But they absolutely should be using their voices, as loudly as possible, to spread the word about their increasingly dire findings. For the rest of us, well, we need to be paying attention. We need to amplify and spread the message of our most knowledgeable voices and stand up where they are muzzled, as a group of Rhode Island residents, Brown students and professors did last week. We need to pick sides in the war on facts. The Narragansett Bay may be getting cleaner, but our political system, and our planet, are sick and getting sicker. We’re going to need science to nurse both back to health.</span></p>

		<title>Guo &#039;18, Huang &#039;19: Talking straight about the Taiwan Strait</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The year 2005 was one of the key moments in the history of a tense, sometimes violent standoff between mainland China, which calls itself the People’s Republic of China, and the island of Taiwan, which calls itself the Republic of China. Since the end of the Chinese Civil War and the flight of the defeated Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949, a state of quasi-war has existed across the Taiwan Strait, as both governments vie to be recognized as the true heirs of the government of China. This geopolitical jostling has persisted into the 21st century. In 2005, faced with the possibility that “an inseparable part of China” might indeed separate, the PRC legislature passed the Anti-Secession Law, which for the first time enshrined the legality of using military means to forcibly prevent Taiwanese secession. Tensions rose to a boiling point on both sides of the Strait, and people were preparing for the tangible, real possibility of a sudden outbreak of war. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It was precisely in this context of international conflict that Johnny Lin ’08, then an undergraduate student, decided to take action from where he stood in faraway Providence. If governments refused to talk to each other, he reasoned, why couldn’t youth take up the mantle and advance the conversation between people on both sides of the Strait? And thus, Strait Talk was born, its mission to identify rising young leaders from mainland China, Taiwan and the United States to engage in honest discussions about the Taiwan Strait conflict during a week-long symposium. As organizers of this year’s Strait Talk symposium, held from Oct. 19 to Oct. 26, we were once again reminded that ordinary people, committed to sincere dialogue and sincere introspection, can overcome the tides of history and politics to advance the cause of peace. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The symposium emphasizes sincerity, not just openness; delegates are prompted not only to express their own viewpoints honestly, but also to contend empathetically with competing opinions. And it’s been wildly successful thus far. Since 2005, this project has been conducted at Providence, Berkeley, Hong Kong and Taipei. Constructive dialogue is more possible than the news cycle makes it out to be — and there’s a real demand for it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To be sure, the events of 2017 — including President Trump’s surprise call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen — suggest that tensions remain flammable. But though the picture seems bleak now, we know from our past experiences at Strait Talk that cross-Strait relations have made tremendous progress since 2005. Today, unlike during the first symposium, speakers from mainland China or Taiwan have not cancelled last-minute, nor have delegates been threatened by their universities or governments for attending. Indeed, every year, the dialogue between Chinese, Taiwanese and American delegates has become more profound, and the solutions they offer in the final consensus document — which all delegates draft and approve at the end of each symposium — have become increasingly creative and hopeful. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In fact, some of these solutions, developed on paper, have come to fruition. In 2005, delegates floated “idealistic” suggestions about creating opportunities for tourism and educational programs across the Taiwan Strait. Not only are those “idealistic” suggestions a reality today, but tourists crossing the Taiwan Strait average around one-quarter million to half a million a year, and thousands of students now attend universities on opposite sides of the Strait, generating new opportunities for both friction and mutual understanding. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We’ve seen with our own eyes how Strait Talk has impacted young Chinese, Taiwanese and American leaders who attended the symposium, now numbering more than 200 strong. Many of the delegates this year told us that they came to the symposium ready for intense debate, laser-focused on defending their own viewpoint — only to discover that they share many attributes with their purported rivals, most importantly a common humanity. As the world continues to be filled with hate, conflict and oppression, such dialogue is important to all of us. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the coming years, Strait Talk Brown plans to continue the important work that we do with our annual symposium, and we invite all Brown students to learn more about us and consider joining our team. We also plan to create spaces on campus to learn about the Taiwan Strait issue and to promote engaged dialogue about its history, significance and future. But foremost, we want to share with the Brown community the story of how undergraduate students on this campus created a space for adversaries to earnestly discuss their histories, feelings and dreams. And we look forward to hearing more such stories in the future. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Trump is a relationship builder. It’s what he does well.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That was the answer I received from Mercedes Schlapp, a Fox News contributor, when I asked her at a panel <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/07/react-symposium-kicks-off-brown-arts-initiative-2/">discussion</a> earlier this year why I should support Trump. I was hoping for an answer that would restore my confidence in the president and the future of our nation. Suffice it to say, I was disappointed. My five-year-old cousin is a good relationship builder, too — and he really shouldn’t be president. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though discomforting, Schlapp’s reply was notable because it elicited distinct reactions from the students and adults in the room. The students seemed dissatisfied with Schlapp’s remark, while the adults seemed more receptive. This dichotomy perfectly illustrated the differences in political opinion between generations — a topic I wrote about in my book, “We Are Generation Z: How Identity, Attitudes, and Perspectives Are Shaping Our Future.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My generation, Generation Z, was born between the mid-1990s and 2010. It is the generation that comprises most college and high school students — an important constituency for politicians. As many Gen Z’ers become eligible to vote, they will play an increasing role in defining American politics. Specifically, Generation Z views politics through a unique prism, one that emphasizes inclusion, economic justice and other progressive ideals. Politicians on both sides of the aisle would do well to pay attention. However, officeholders have generally failed to recognize and address Generation Z’s political perspectives. Trump won the 2016 election with only 36 percent of the younger generation’s vote — a figure that suggests he won’t fare well amongst the next generation of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/political-issues/">voters</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Generation Z’s political inclinations have been shaped by their exposure to technology, the ubiquity of which has led to an increasing awareness of the diverse cultures, viewpoints and beliefs around our country and the world. This, in turn, has led to arguably the most tolerant generation in history. We can expect to see current trends amongst millennials only further strengthened in Generation Z. For example, a 2010 Pew <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/11/18/the-decline-of-marriage-and-rise-of-new-families/">survey</a> found that respondents between the ages of 18 and 29 were three times more likely than those above the age of 65 to support interracial marriages and the raising of children by gay and lesbian couples.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This tolerance also manifests itself in Generation Z’s views on civil liberties and terrorism. Many Gen Z’ers are too young to meaningfully remember 9/11. As such, we do not see the “War on Terror” with the same sense of urgency and insecurity that older Americans do. In fact, between 2010 and 2013, the proportion of young people aged 18-29 who believed that American anti-terror policies have gone too far in restricting civil liberties increased by 50 <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/07/26/few-see-adequate-limits-on-nsa-surveillance-program/">percent</a>. Furthermore, 72 percent of young people — compared with 49 percent of Baby Boomers and 46 percent of those in Generation X, born before the early 1980s — said that civil liberties do not need to be infringed to curb terrorism. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Economic justice, with respect to higher education and big business, is also important to Generation Z. The exponential growth in college tuition disproportionately affects young people, 35 percent of whom have trouble buying daily necessities and 55 percent of whom say they must defer home and car <a href="http://www.asa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/life_delayed_whitepaper_2015.pdf">ownership</a> because of student loans. In fact, student loans weigh so heavily in the lives of young people that nearly half would forfeit the right to vote in the next two presidential elections to have them <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/29/millennials-would-give-up-this-right-to-wipe-out-their-student-loans.html">forgiven</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gen Z’ers are also concerned about the larger economy since we came of age during the latest economic recession in 2008. Business deregulation, bank bailouts and widening inequality in the recession’s aftermath made us feel uncertain about our own futures. Gen Z’ers are far more likely than older Americans to say that businesses enjoy more control over our lives than <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/02/24/millennials-confident-connected-open-to-change/)">government</a> and that government should take more action to combat economic injustice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How our society comes to terms with Generation Z’s new brand of politics — and its associated nuances — has serious consequences, both for politicians seeking office and for our democracy at large. First, as more Gen Z’ers reach adulthood, they will begin to solidify their political leanings. To resonate with young people and encourage them to be lifelong supporters, Democrats and Republicans must address youth voters’ interests now. That means talking about college affordability more forcefully — instead of making vague policy proposals about tuition like Trump <a href="http://time.com/money/4523209/clinton-trump-college-affordability/">did</a> — and combatting inequality more aggressively — instead of relying on mega-donors, like Hillary Clinton <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-mega-donors-helped-raise-1-billion-for-hillary-clinton/2016/10/22/a92a0ee2-9603-11e6-bb29-bf2701dbe0a3_story.html?utm_term=.cce656d145f4">did</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But more importantly, politicians need to answer the concerns of young people if they want to properly train the next generation of citizens. Youth engagement now will increase civic participation down the line. This is extremely important for the future of our democracy. We need to educate voters so that they feel comfortable wrestling with tough political issues and setting high expectations for candidates. After all, as the past year has shown, ordinary people who are organized and politically active can make a difference in our political system. And if we don’t reach out to young people, respond to their needs and encourage them to care about politics now, they won’t be ready to stand up for our <em>democracy and for our values later.</em></span></p>

		<title>Overall &#039;19: Confronting the exclusivity of study abroad</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the final days of my sophomore winter break, I decided I wanted to study abroad. After researching different programs and weighing the options, my academic interests led me to an international relations program based in Amman, Jordan. One event then led seamlessly to the other: applying, petitioning for approval and accepting. The process felt rhythmic and almost automatic. However, when I told friends and family members that I would be studying in Jordan for a few months, their reactions were those of shock, with a poignant undertone of, “Why?”: “Why are you going to the Middle East? Is it, like, safe over there? Why not just go to Europe?”</p>
<p class="p2">For me, the answer to these questions was clear: Since my academic interests prioritize studying Middle Eastern geopolitics, the idea of learning this topic somewhere in Europe felt like a cop-out. Yet my friends’ recurring questions were representative of broader misconceptions about the study abroad experience that plague many hyper-liberal and academic bubbles, including those at Brown.</p>
<p class="p2">Historically, study abroad gained national momentum across universities at the end of World War I, with American colleges hoping to “explore creative ways to inspire students to learn more about the world outside of U.S. borders,” as one study abroad program <a href="https://www.gooverseas.com/go-abroad-blog/history-study-abroad-part-1">summarizes</a>. From its conception, study abroad was created from a wealthy, Western perspective and based on a concept of education that prioritized enjoyment over critical learning. Today, “study abroad” is still marketed to students as a way to “broaden horizons.” This marketing technique commodifies the process of studying overseas, reserving it for those who can access and afford it.</p>
<p class="p2">The purpose of this op-ed is not to diminish, reduce or cast aside any study abroad experience. Packing up and moving across the world, in any context, is a remarkable feat and every student’s experience is valued and important. However, the patterns and rituals that are emerging from study abroad experiences appear to shift the focus of going abroad from learning to collecting bragging rights, and these trends have disturbing implications for the exclusivity of the program.</p>
<p class="p2">For a start, students generally elect to travel to an ally of the United States — often in Europe. In 2015, a NAFSA: Association of International Educators study found that 54.5 percent of study abroad from U.S. institutions takes place in Europe, “ . . . with almost 40 percent of students studying in just four countries: the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and France.” These countries are also frequently ranked among the most expensive places in Europe, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/eiu-the-most-expensive-cities-in-europe-2017-3/?r=UK&amp;IR=T#11-dublin-ireland-dublin-has-been-in-the-spotlight-since-britain-voted-to-leave-the-eu-with-many-eu-companies-thought-to-be-considering-moving-staff-from-london-to-the-irish-capital-8">contributing</a> to the notion that studying abroad is more for an exclusive travel experience, rather than an education. And in terms of who was physically traveling, NAFSA <a href="http://www.nafsa.org/Policy_and_Advocacy/Policy_Resources/Policy_Trends_and_Data/Trends_in_U_S__Study_Abroad/">reports</a> in the same study that 72.9 percent of students abroad in 2015 were white, 8.8 percent were Hispanic or Latino American and 5.6 percent were black.</p>
<p class="p2">There are a few clear reasons for these trends. Although many universities, including Brown, offer financial assistance for low-income students to travel abroad, the cost of living in the most popular study abroad destination is a heavy financial reality. Students are also asked to fully step away from the many roles they assume at school, often sacrificing paying jobs held during the year and foregoing a certain number of mandatory on-campus credits, depending on the flexibility of one’s concentration. The freedom to take an absence from work and strict academic requirements without any difficulties is, again, a privilege.</p>
<p class="p2">And there is another trend driving the exclusivity of study abroad, one that is becoming a cornerstone of the study abroad experience: the necessity of maintaining an unwavering social media presence. Every day, when I check any social media platform, my feed is cluttered with constant reminders from friends that are abroad. I find myself in a network of activity surrounding travel that I too want to be a part of. A boomerang of a wine tasting in Italy, an Instagram post from Oktoberfest, a group mirror selfie from a museum in Copenhagen. “Here we are,” these posts seem to shout. “We’re experiencing different countries! Are we cultured yet?” I am the first to confess to being an active member in this hip and all-consuming broadcast network; this speaks to the sensationalized social media culture that millennial travelers cultivate. Put bluntly, this is an attitude that prioritizes traveling to curate the “cultured” profile. But this trend perpetuates the exclusivity of study abroad as these acts “boast” experiences that are not open to everyone. This in turn emphasizes the perception that study abroad is rooted in experiences that emphasize wealth and privilege, solidifying the line of separation between those who can participate versus those who cannot.</p>
<p class="p2">As we confront these realities of study abroad, the question remains: How do we, as students, reconcile the value of education through travel with its exclusivity? Perhaps the solution is twofold: challenging the expectation that studying abroad is simply a travel tournament<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and creating policies that make going abroad more accessible, such as an increase in financial aid and a more diverse range of programs. Either way, change will only begin if we acknowledge how study abroad has been commodified into an exclusive, rather than an educational, experience.</p>

		<title>Metz ’20: Sen. Al Franken: Step down</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After Leeann Tweeden revealed that Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn, had groped and kissed her against her will during a comedy tour in 2006, many commentators wasted no time accusing Democrats of hypocrisy amid the emerging Roy Moore scandal. Too often, they were right.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Far too many on the left — including some of those who most vehemently condemned Moore — have remained silent when asked about Franken. That silence, like the Senator’s behavior, is unacceptable. Now, with Lindsay Menz telling CNN that she was groped by Franken while taking a picture with him at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010, that silence is all the more deafening. <span class="Apple-converted-space">                   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tweeden’s and Menz’s revelations seem shocking, to be sure. Franken has made a name for himself in Congress by fighting to protect and expand progressive programs from Obamacare to the Violence Against Women Act. On the other hand, Franken’s actions are far from surprising to the millions of individuals who have grown up in a society that is far too tolerant of harassment, discrimination and sexual violence at home and in the workplace. If Democrats wish to demonstrate their dedication to women’s issues, it is critical that elected officials and voters alike urge Franken to resign. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If Democrats turn a blind eye to Sen. Franken, they do so at their own risk. The year since Donald Trump — a man caught admitting to sexual assault on tape — was elected president has seen American women mobilize on an unprecedented scale. Just this past January, more than four million women turned to the streets to fight for their rights. They represent real electoral power and champion vital issues, but far too many Democratic politicians have taken it for granted that they will be the beneficiaries. So far, though, many Democrats in Congress and around the country have shown that they are more willing to condemn predators in the GOP than in their own ranks. During an interview on Sunday morning, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — the highest-ranking Democrat in the country — declined to condemn accused harasser John Conyers (Mich.-13), the ranking Democratic member of the House Judiciary Committee. Pelosi’s hedging broadcast to predators in both parties, and to their victims, that Democrats are willing to turn a blind eye to self-declared progressives like Conyers and Franken. If her fellow Democratic office-holders give in to the worst impulses of political expediency by treating accusations against their own differently from allegations against their opponents, they will have willingly ignored the realities that half of their constituents face.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By responding to allegations of sexual harassment with partisan defensiveness and bickering, Democrats will reinforce a culture that silences survivors. This silence is already especially profound for marginalized groups, such as immigrants, people of color, gender-non conforming and trans people and those with disabilities. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is not enough that Democrats be better than the other side. It is not enough that we merely point out abuses in the GOP to earn the votes of the millions of Americans who every year face sexual assault, sexual abuse and sexual harassment. It is not enough that we condemn predators in the Republican party while merely slapping those in our own on the wrist. It is not enough to call for an Ethics Committee investigation, even after Sen. Franken has admitted to groping an unconscious woman. It is not enough to ask for women’s votes if we do not truly represent their interests. We cannot change the country from the top down. But we can start by setting a positive example — by calling out sexual abuse in the other party and in our own; by electing women to offices around the country; and by listening to, and standing with, survivors. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sen. Franken has distinguished himself in Congress, but for the sake of the growing movement for women’s equality, it is time for him to go. As Franken steps back into his office <a href="http://www.startribune.com/ashamed-franken-says-he-ll-return-to-work-on-monday/460108233/">today</a>, we call on Democratic office-holders around the country to join us in urging Sen. Franken to step down immediately. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">“Strategic Options” was the title of a document I was given by my predecessor shortly after being elected general manager of 95.5 WBRU-FM in 2015, the fall of my sophomore year. The document laid out a narrative of the station’s steady decline, a few possibilities for moving forward and the strong suggestion that it was time to sell our license to broadcast on the frequency 95.5. I joined WBRU the previous spring as a struggling first-year looking for a place to carve out as my own on a campus that had been both overwhelming and unwelcoming. I hadn’t been at the station long enough to have fully earned the position to which I’d been elected. At the beginning of my term, I didn’t understand how dire our situation was or why station members who had been around longer than I had refused to take a leadership position. Student leaders spent the entirety of 2016 working to maintain WBRU on radio and seeking out strategic options that could change our circumstances, but by the end of the year, we confronted the impending reality that we would have to sell.</p>
<p class="p2">Initially, I had no interest in selling, no matter how many people in the years above me — who had similarly sacrificed their lives and their sanity to the station — told me they’d seen the organization deteriorate every year. I inherited a Board of Directors — comprised of station alums and industry professionals who continue to volunteer their energy and expertise to keeping the organization running — fixed in a hostile stalemate. I couldn’t imagine selling because I didn’t want to lose the opportunities that WBRU allowed. Motivated students with little-to-no industry experience had the chance to interview local and national bands, go to music festivals with press passes, throw concerts in Providence attended by thousands of people and, most importantly, interact daily with devoted listeners within the radius of a signal that spanned Rhode Island and parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts. We were taken seriously while doing work that mattered to us and interacting with local communities in ways that were as close to peer-driven and mutually beneficial as the University can hope to get in Providence.</p>
<p class="p2">As general manager in 2016, I led a staff of six professionals and nine student managers. I oversaw recruitment efforts, long-term business strategies and projects for a student-run radio station and 501(c)(3) educational not-for-profit with an operating budget of $1 million. For someone with no business expertise and little inclination in that direction, it was a bizarre and wonderful learning experience. Working in tandem with student and alumni volunteers who have given so much of themselves to these projects, we turned over every possible rock that might hold a path to financial viability. We ran a fundraising campaign, cut costs by changing our phone lines, continued talks with Rhode Island Public Radio, pursued a joint sales agreement with another local independent station (of which there are increasingly few as they remain unable to compete in a market that favors corporate clusters, who have efficiencies independent stations do not), discussed changing our format, put a professional on the morning show “BRU Breakfast” for ratings, hired a consultant and, after reviews, cut down our salaried professional staff.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a 20-year-old running a nonprofit that couldn’t turn a profit, I was in the position of informing a salesperson twice my age (who had more experience in the industry and who had spent more time at this particular organization) that we had no intention of renewing their contract. We fired one professional and moved one to part time. The resulting animosity between professional and student staff was palpable in every meeting; each blamed the other for our circumstances. I was confused, and a little scared, when the GM before me said that she felt like a completely different person at the end of her term — but now I think I know what she meant. WBRU, it seems, has always been a sink-or-swim learning environment. Rising to the occasion is the only option — there are no alternatives. </span></p>
<p class="p2">My cohort of student leadership was the latest in a series of executive boards to continue to operate a failing business that had peaked in the 1990s and early 2000s. It was as if simply keeping the lights on was the only way to preserve a kind of college radio that no longer exists. But we couldn’t keep the lights on anymore. We struggled to maintain daily operations when our staff dwindled. We were too consumed by crisis management to explore our own creativity or cultivate experiences relevant to a media industry that is largely leaving radio behind.</p>
<p class="p2">The recent sale of WBRU’s FM license is what it looks like when a declining business acknowledges a downward trend and takes decisive action to prevent becoming just another casualty of modernity. Still, station members have been accused of being defeatists by people who oppose the sale. The process of entirely restructuring our organization, rewriting our constitution and transitioning to a digital platform is not for people who are afraid of a challenge. A sale is not an easy way out. The responsibility we feel to Providence communities, the University and our alums guides each discussion in this transitional period. Our scale has changed, but we’re still working to offer meaningful opportunities and tell important stories in Providence.</p>
<p class="p2">My time at Brown has been defined by WBRU — anyone who knows me even tangentially can confirm. I am grateful to this unusual, unmatched institution, and to every student who has stumbled into 88 Benevolent St. and shown their willingness to make sacrifices for the good of an organization that means the world to us and to thousands of our listeners. Whenever an alum told me that their degree might be from Brown but they actually studied at the University of WBRU, I scoffed. But I’m getting older and more sentimental, and I find myself inclined to say the same.</p>

		<title>Savello ’18: Calling out catcalling</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/12/03/savello-18-calling-catcalling/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">About a year ago, while I was walking down Thayer Street one afternoon, a man told me he liked my dress. Pleased with the compliment, I thanked him as I continued down my path, only to hear him shouting after me: “It would look better off!” Infuriated and embarrassed, I turned around to say something, but he had already diffused into a crowd of people. I never suspected that someone would catcall me so blatantly on College Hill — and I was even more surprised that none of the people around us confronted him or offered me support. As I kept walking down the street, I began to question whether I was in some way responsible for eliciting this inappropriate attention — whether my outfit or appearance was somehow provocative — even though I knew that I wasn’t to blame. The incident and other similar ones soon after also made me question how safe I really was on College Hill. I am not alone in this experience. In fact, a recent Herald undergraduate <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/26/half-students-oppose-cccs-proposal-move-drop-deadline/">poll</a> shows that 48.2 percent of female-identifying students surveyed are catcalled at least once a month while at Brown.</p>
<p class="p2">Many of us tend to dismiss catcalling as a form of harassment that is annoying but not particularly harmful; some even seem to think that these remarks are complimentary. But in reality, catcalls can have serious implications for an individual’s confidence and self-esteem. Deeply rooted in implicit sexism, these comments are objectifying and perpetuate the stereotype that those targeted — who are overwhelmingly women — are only valued for their physical appearances. Catcalls can be particularly harmful if recipients begin to feel unsafe in their daily environments or internalize the comments, blaming themselves for the unsolicited attention — like I did.</p>
<p class="p2">We are all aware of the pervasiveness of catcalling in general: A controversial video titled, “10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman” shows a woman being catcalled over 100 times in just 10 hours for simply walking down the street. But much less is said about how commonplace catcalling is around campus. Now that we finally have survey data showing that many students experience this as frequently as once a month, it is time to begin conversations about verbal harassment on College Hill and how we can best address this.</p>
<p class="p2">Unfortunately, catcalling is a difficult problem to combat because it happens so quickly and catcallers are not always as explicit as they appear to be in commercials or movies. And even if catcallers are confronted, there’s no guarantee that they will apologize for their actions or learn the error of their ways — an issue that is perhaps more frustrating than the comments themselves. Moreover, since Thayer Street is a hub for Providence as well as Brown, catcallers often throw out slurs from the windows of moving cars. For example, I remember quite distinctly an occasion in which a young man shouted a sexual comment at me from the window of his car as I walked past the SciLi, comparing the way I was drinking a smoothie to how I could provide him with sexual favors. This type of drive-by catcalling makes it virtually impossible for people to challenge the offenders.</p>
<p class="p2">Still, there are things we can do to address catcalling in our community. Bystanders who observe this type of behavior should offer their support to those who need it and report it to public safety staffers if the situation escalates. Preventing catcalling also begins with making perpetrators aware of the dangerous implications of their words. Though it is not necessarily our responsibility, it can be helpful to explicitly state that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>such behavior is offensive and wrong. Standing in support of those targeted can also help them feel safer and less embarrassed: I, for one, would have felt much more comfortable if bystanders had reacted in my defense.</p>
<p class="p2">Another way to help combat this issue, on a more general level, is to start discussions about it on campus. For one thing, this can help identify the areas on campus in which this occurs the most and the people who are repeat offenders. These conversations can also help educate people about the insidious effects of catcalling — and letting catcalling go unchallenged. Finally, these conversations can help those targeted of all genders understand that they have nothing to be ashamed of, and counteract the internalization of harmful comments.</p>
<p class="p2">I understand that there will always be people in the world who make offensive remarks, both on campus and off. But by opening up a discussion and brainstorming strategies to combat this issue, we can help make our community — and the world — a safer and more inclusive place.</p>

		<title>Pichardo ’20: Do you know where the homeless people are?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last week, the streets of Providence were especially empty. As I walked through Downcity Providence and up Broad Street, I could feel the absence of the city’s most vulnerable, who usually sleep near the river downtown, line the entrance of Crossroads Rhode Island, a large Providence shelter, and congregate at bus stops on the South Side. Over the past year, I’ve been working as an outreach worker with the Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project, an organization of formerly homeless people that seeks to build relationships with people currently experiencing homelessness and connect them with resources. During my time with RIHAP, I’ve come to look forward to my interactions with the homeless and on quiet nights like this most recent one, I always hope that the absence of familiar faces on the streets means that more folks have been housed.</p>
<p class="p2">However, while I’d like to be optimistic, I know better than to believe this. Many in the homeless community are likely sleeping on the floors of overflow shelters that require them to leave before sunrise. Others very likely have journeyed out of the city to other parts of the state or even the country; a few individuals I’ve met before have done so in hopes of finding relief elsewhere. More still, I suspect, have been actively pushed outside of their usual dwellings by law enforcement, as has been occurring in downtown Providence for the past few years. This movement of people experiencing homelessness is not occurring on its own; the homeless don’t always leave public spaces of their own accord. Stakeholders with influence at both the local and state level are taking deliberate steps to remove the homeless from public view. It is vital that people are aware of when the homeless community is both present in and absent from society.</p>
<p class="p2">Over the course of the nearly two hours I was on outreach Thursday night, my team came across only five people, a record low for me. I was introduced to outreach last September through <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/27/hope-membership-influence-grows-rhode-island/">Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere</a>, a student group I now co-lead that aims to end homelessness in Rhode Island. We have over 75 students doing nighttime outreach in downtown Providence, South Side and Pawtucket six nights a week. This week, the teams responsible for outreach in Downtown and South Side, which often see a steady number of people, were all asking themselves the same question: Where have all the homeless folks gone? At this time, we can only speculate as to whether or not these low numbers are here to stay, but in my experience, efforts to transform the area surrounding Kennedy Plaza and Burnside Park into lively hubs for commerce have meant increased policing and the criminalization of homelessness, particularly in down town Providence.http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170616/enforcement-of-downtown-smoking-ban-will-take-time-and-signage</p>
<p class="p2">This past summer, the Providence City Council — in conjunction with the former mayor of Providence and owner of Paolino Properties, Joe Paolino — tried to tackle the “homeless issue” by banning smoking in Kennedy Plaza. According to WPRI 12 Eyewitness News, Paolino, who has business interests downtown, was strongly in favor of the ban on <a href="http://wpri.com/2017/06/15/providence-city-council-may-restore-smoking-ban-with-override-vote/">smoking</a> and said it was about “fairness.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 2015, a similar ordinance was implemented, banning smoking in <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170616/enforcement-of-downtown-smoking-ban-will-take-time-and-signage">all city parks</a>, including Burnside Park, which sits beside Kennedy Plaza. (Homeless advocates say the smoking ban in Burnside Park drove the <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/08/do-outdoor-smoking-bans-mostly-punish-the-homeless/400886/">homeless</a> from the park and into Kennedy Plaza.)</p>
<p class="p2">While promoted as a public health measure, the smoking ban actually functions as a way to encourage or “force” the homeless presence out of Kennedy Plaza and into less visible parts of the city, such as Broad Street in South Providence. When the ordinance was sent to Mayor Jorge Elorza earlier this year for approval, he vetoed it, writing in his veto message that though this “ordinance is ostensibly about smoking, its true target is the homeless community.” In an 11-2 vote, the council passed the ordinance, overriding his veto.</p>
<p class="p2">Last year while on outreach, my team came across a group of about four police officers that had stopped some folks along the Providence River. We stayed in the area in case they were homeless and being harassed, and approached the officers when the interaction had finished. While the folks they approached hadn’t been homeless, we learned that the officers were not from Providence, but rather from neighboring cities in Rhode Island, which certainly can affect the dynamics between those policing and those being policed. The lead officer that night, though informed of our work, said as we departed, “No one wants to see the homeless downtown … no offense.”</p>
<p class="p2">Frankly, the homeless don’t want to be out there either; the list of Rhode Islanders awaiting housing is <a href="http://www.rimonthly.com/rhode-island-needs-more-housing/">growing</a>. For the many who have waited years to receive housing vouchers from local agencies, the wait continues as they and their case workers attempt to <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20161114/more-than-9000-apply-for-ri-housing-voucher-wait-lists">find</a> a landlord willing to accept them as tenants. For many landlords, agreeing to house homeless individuals may seem risky, due to their <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170714/evicted-in-ri-when-theres-no-place-like-home">financial insecurity</a> and negative stereotypes surrounding homelessness, such as the idea that all homeless people suffer from addiction. Therefore, despite the vouchers (and at times because of them), landlords sometimes discriminate against the homeless. And this housing discrimination makes it vastly harder for them to get off the streets.</p>
<p class="p2">It is our responsibility as members of the Rhode Island community to pay attention to and resist the deliberate push of homeless folks out of visible spaces and into marginalized communities. The homeless deserve to be seen and to occupy public spaces as they see fit. Their visibility mustn’t be denied because it makes other people uncomfortable.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear Director Edward Steinfeld:</span></p>
<p class="p2">On Sept. 15, Dean Douglas Elmendorf of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/announcements/statement-dean-elmendorf-regarding-invitation-chelsea-manning-be-visiting-fellow">rescinded</a> his invitation to Chelsea Manning to be a Visiting Fellow. Harvard’s initial offer to Manning prompted the public foot-stomping of former CIA Deputy Director <a href="https://twitter.com/Mosheh/status/908367178067574784">Mike Morrell</a> and current CIA Director <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chelsea-manning-harvard-acceptance-mike-pompeo-letter-2017-9">Mike Pompeo</a>, the latter of whom labeled the whistleblower a “traitor” to her country. We are deeply disappointed that an institution like Harvard, ostensibly dedicated to principles of political justice and free expression, would avoid bestowing any “perceived honor” on Manning, who is widely lauded for both her exposure of potential war crimes and for her courage in the face of cruelty and torture. With this recent action, Harvard has transparently embraced and amplified the interests of government officials who seek to marginalize those who expose their actions to public scrutiny. We believe Manning deserves to be honored for her dedication to “serving the community, the nation and the world by discovering, communicating and preserving knowledge and understanding in a spirit of free inquiry...” These, after all, are the opening words of Brown University’s mission statement. Brown War Watch and the undersigned ask that the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs join us in our commitment to the University’s mission and invite Manning to Brown as a visiting fellow or in some other official capacity, where she can receive the honor and appreciation she deserves.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Aug. 21, 2013, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after she exposed potential war crimes committed by the U.S. military. Included among these crimes were the wanton killing of over a dozen Iraqi men, including two Reuters journalists, the use of bombing raids to conceal the extrajudicial execution of Iraqi civilians and the torture and baseless detainment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. We believe empowering and defending whistleblowers like Manning is critical for maintaining accountable institutions, and for holding governments to the standards of the people they govern. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The specific reasons behind Harvard’s decision to rescind Manning’s invitation are widely disputed. <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/special-reports/article24602194.html">McClatchy</a>, the <a href="http://www.joplinglobe.com/news/ap-review-finds-no-threatened-wikileaks-sources/article_6ea02c66-3c36-5b9f-b7c5-d478390ffe9d.html">Associated Press</a> and former Defense Secretary <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/11/30/131700348/wikileaks-impact-on-foreign-policy-fairly-modest-gates-says">Robert Gates</a> have all emphasized that the material released by Manning never posed a security threat to any U.S. government personnel. Instead, the primary effects of her leaks were to invigorate public scrutiny of military action and to help kindle the Arab uprisings of the early 2010s, as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/opinion/keller-wikileaks-a-postscript.html">argued</a> by New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller. Manning’s actions are real-world examples of a principle laid out in President Christina Paxson’s P’19 strategic plan, “Building on Distinction,” namely, to “support scholarship and public discourse on institutions and ideas that promote social justice.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During her seven-year incarceration, Manning faced “cruel and inhumane” treatment, according to a United Nations <a href="https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/03/UN-Report-on-Bradley-Manning.pdf">special rapporteur</a> on torture. Manning was subjected to constant surveillance, stripped naked in humiliating public displays and often kept in extended isolation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/us/chelsea-manning-tried-committing-suicide-a-second-time-in-october.html?mcubz=3">driving her</a> to attempt suicide more than once. According to <a href="https://www.salon.com/2011/03/10/amnesty_7/">Amnesty International</a>, Manning’s treatment constituted a “breach (of) the (United States’) obligations under international standards and treaties.” Despite the inhumane conditions of her confinement, Manning made the decision to come out as transgender and demand the medical and psychological treatment she deserved. She is therefore not just a symbol of political justice, but also a major figure in the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We request that the Watson Institute continue the University’s commitment to justice, human rights and free expression by inviting Chelsea Manning to Brown University as a visiting fellow or in some other official capacity. Bestowing this distinction upon Manning would be an opportunity for Brown to demonstrate on the national stage how a university can responsibly channel its substantial influence to fight for global justice and the rights of LGBTQ+ people.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sincerely,</span></p>

		<title>Hood ’17.5: Don’t invite Chelsea Manning to Brown</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Matthew Ricci GS and Babak Hemmatian Borujeni GS published an op-ed in The Herald Wednesday asking that Brown University and the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs offer Chelsea Manning — a former Army intelligence analyst responsible for the 2010 leak of government documents — a Visiting Fellow position. She had previously been offered a position at Harvard, but the offer was rescinded as pressure from Washington and outrage from the public mounted. The two authors argue that offering Manning a position would “be an opportunity for Brown to demonstrate on the national stage how a university can responsibly channel its substantial influence to fight for global justice and the rights of LGBTQ+ people.” Not only are Ricci and Hemmatian Borujeni grossly misrepresenting Manning’s story, but if Brown “bestowed this distinction” on Manning, the University would undermine the entire military by showing that dishonorable actions can be rewarded. There is no greater insult to Brown’s veterans and veterans across America than offering a position to a traitor who was dishonorably discharged and found guilty of 19 of the 21 charges brought against her — including espionage and the release of classified <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-manning-guilty-on-many-charges-not-most-serious-2013jul30-story.html">information</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Manning was convicted in 2013 for releasing over 700,000 sensitive military and government documents. This leak has been described as “the largest leak of classified documents in US history,” according to the Washington <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/chelsea-manning-files-to-run-for-us-senate-in-maryland/2018/01/13/6439f0d0-f88c-11e7-beb6-c8d48830c54d_story.html?utm_term=.6746acd5009c">Post</a>. Not only did Manning knowingly disobey the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the legal fabric that holds the military together, but the documents released to WikiLeaks unveiled the names of many military and civilian operatives working with the United States. Manning defended her actions by claiming she had revealed war crimes committed by the United States; however, she also compromised the safety of numerous personnel, some of whom had to be evacuated at the last minute because they were identified in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/us/politics/obama-commutes-bulk-of-chelsea-mannings-sentence.html">documents</a>. Put differently, Manning recklessly and without thought of consequences handed over classified information to unauthorized sources and put countless lives at risk.</p>
<p class="p2">In 2011, former president Barack Obama claimed that “‘she broke the law’ and deserved <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/314703-obama- in-2011- manning-broke- the-law">punishment</a>.” (Why Obama commuted Manning’s 35-year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/us/politics/obama-commutes- bulk-of- chelsea-mannings-sentence.html)">sentence</a>, of which she served seven at a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, is beyond me.)</p>
<p class="p2">Ricci and Hemmatian Borujeni, however, offer a different interpretation of Manning’s actions. They argue that Manning is a hero of social justice for whistleblowing. While whistleblowers should be protected under certain circumstances, the costs of the information’s release and the damage that is caused should always weigh in the balance. In this case, Manning neglected to redact the names of the Afghan operatives assisting American forces in the documents before releasing the information to WikiLeaks and risking their lives. Ricci and Hemmatian Borujeni also claim that Manning is a champion of the LGBTQ+ community, as she underwent gender reassignment surgery while incarcerated. Though the difficulties and challenges of being trans are very real, and Manning has likely experienced these prejudices, these facts do not exonerate her from having undermined the American armed forces.</p>
<p class="p2">Indeed, Ricci and Hemmatian Borujeni’s plea rests on some obscure notion of moral superiority — that, by offering Manning a position at the University, Brown will demonstrate to the world its moral strength and vast understanding. This is not only an erroneous idea, but also injurious to the University’s reputation.</p>
<p class="p2">If the University wishes to bring a veteran who advocates for the LGBTQ+ community to campus, then I suggest <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/meet-kristin-beck-2017-7">Kristen Beck</a>. Beck, a former Navy Seal, served multiple tours overseas and separated honorably. Upon separation, Beck underwent gender reassignment surgery. She is a real hero of “global justice and the rights of (the) LGBTQ+” community. Chelsea Manning is a criminal. If Brown offers Manning a position, then one thing will become frighteningly clear: Brown cares more about appearances than substance. It is more important to look like the institution fights for justice, even if its new appointee violated military law, undercut the military’s operations and put many people in harm’s way.</p>
<p class="p2">I hope Brown and its administration very carefully consider the ramifications of their decisions if they offer her a position. Furthermore, I hope Ricci and Hemmatian Borujeni reconsider their perspective. In selecting a new Visiting Fellow, Brown ought to find someone who has actually fought for justice and endured the hardships and tribulations of trans life without selling out her fellow soldiers.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">National media attention surrounding the issue of immigration has largely centered on President Trump’s derision of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“bad hombres” from “shithole countries” — specifically those from Latin America. Immigration activists’ focus on Latinx undocumented immigration is, of course, justified: The majority of undocumented immigrants come from Latin America. However, Trump’s simplification of undocumented immigrants as Latinx allows the American public to forget that a large proportion of undocumented immigrants actually come from Asia. In popular discourse, Asian Americans are lumped together as primarily East Asian, obedient, educated and labor-producing bodies. Regrettably, the counter-narrative that exposes the hundreds of thousands of undocumented Asian immigrants living in the shadows remains largely unheard.</p>
<p class="p3">Asian Americans are not only the fastest growing racial minority in the United States, but the fastest growing population of undocumented immigrants as well. Of the <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/korean-immigrants-united-states-2">1.8 million</a> Korean Americans in the United States, 200,000 are undocumented, making up a significant percentage of the total population of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/06/us/politics/undocumented-illegal-immigrants.html?mcubz=1">1.5 million undocumented Asians</a>. Further, since 1990, the number of undocumented immigrants from South Korea has risen 800 percent. Yet, the plight of these immigrants has received little attention, and, within the overarching narrative of undocumented immigration, there has been little political advocacy specifically in support of Asian undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p class="p3">To fully conceptualize this popular disregard of Asian immigrant issues, it is important to first understand Asian America’s racialized history. First, Trump’s travel ban itself has a precedent in Asian America in the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the first law that banned a specific ethnic group from entering the United States. Moreover, historical memories of Japanese internment and, for the Korean community, the 1992 riots in Los Angeles — in which 2,300 Korean-owned businesses were burned or looted — ring fresh in the Asian American collective imaginary. U.S. imperialism — the occupation of the Philippines, the war in Southeast Asia and the Korean war — has also been a significant determinant of the Asian American experience. Overall, these violent histories push back against comfortable model minority tropes imposed on all Asian Americans, and introduce a common thread of experience among immigrant groups.</p>
<p class="p3">Today, Asians make up over <a href="http://aapidata.com/blog/asian-undoc-1in7/">10 percent</a> of the population of undocumented immigrants, but only 2 percent of applicants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed immigrants brought to the United States as children to stay in the country. (Only two Asian countries, South Korea and the Philippines, are in the top ten countries of origin for DACA recipients.) According to the Migration Policy Institute, only 15 percent of eligible Korean immigrants had applied for DACA benefits, compared to a <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca-profiles">DACA participation rate</a> of 65 percent among Mexican immigrants and 62 percent among El Salvadoran immigrants. This gap in DACA participation may be partly due to the difficulties associated with reaching the diverse Asian community in the United States. Moreover, though various ethnic organizations (largely Korean, Filipino and Cambodian) have established strategic plans to reach their undocumented populations, the sheer diversity of language and culture of Asian America hinders any comprehensive efforts to assist the population as a whole.</p>
<p class="p3">A whole host of subtle dynamics further complicates the experiences of undocumented Asian immigrants. There is a relative dearth of media outlets for undocumented Asian immigrants. There is no Univision or Telemundo to unite Asian America (nor is it possible to create such television channels). Further, when Asians do attend spaces consisting only of undocumented immigrants, their representatives are often pushed to the margins, and their undocumented experiences are considered different from those of others. There is also a hidden shame among Asian families surrounding the label “illegal” — at least among Korean immigrants. This stigma, in turn, stifles the community’s ability to push for immigrant rights and combat the model minority stereotype, which has been used to label Asian Americans as a self-sufficient monolith without any need for rights and protections.</p>
<p class="p3">Trump has remained inconclusive on what to do with DACA, constantly flipping back and forth on his policy proposals. But he has remained steadfast in his disdain for immigrants. Recently, the Korean American Students Association at Brown has begun to focus its efforts on DREAM advocacy and draw more attention to undocumented Asians. The Korean American Students Association sent out an online poll which found that our group’s general body members overwhelmingly support the DREAM Act. Based on the results of this poll, and in conjunction with the nonprofit Korean American Civic Empowerment, KASA hosted a phone bank to advocate for undocumented youth and provide a space for its members to call their respective Congress members in support of the DREAM Act.</p>
<p class="p3">The Brown Korean American community stands for the 230,000 Korean undocumented immigrants and 7,000 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/05/us/politics/who-are-the-dreamers.html?mcubz=0&amp;_r=0">Korean beneficiaries of DACA</a>. We yearn to see an America in which these immigrants can receive full American citizenship. To achieve this vision, Koreans, Asian Americans and all undocumented immigrants must do more to share their experiences and advance their shared objectives. As an organization composed largely of immigrants and children of immigrants, we at KASA wholly believe that immigrants are a crucial part of American democracy, and that the undocumented individuals among us must be valued as such.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last week, thousands gathered on the Smithsonian Mall for the second Women’s March on Washington, commemorating the one-year anniversary of both Trump’s presidency and the record-breaking day of protest that followed.</p>
<p class="p2">Some pulled out their bright pink “Pussyhats” for the occasion, while others wore their statement “The Future is Female” or “Nasty Women Unite” tees. Most carried homemade signs displaying powerful messages and some masterful puns:</p>
<p class="p2">“Tweet Women with Respect.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Vulva la Resistencia.”</p>
<p class="p2">“OMG. GOP. WTF.”</p>
<p class="p2">Gathering on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, marching down Pennsylvania Avenue and demonstrating outside of the White House, this army of protesters came out to have its voice heard and demands met. I showed up with a sign of my own, my mom and a deep desire to do something.</p>
<p class="p2">It’s been a long year. A long year of watching a man who has been accused of sexual assault by 19 women sit in the Oval Office and perform the duties of the president. A long year challenging the White House’s discriminatory and destructive policies threatening our country’s most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="p2">But it has also been a year of empowerment — a year of speaking out.</p>
<p class="p2">The past few months have marked a true watershed moment in our society, as countless brave women have stepped forward to share their deeply personal and painful experiences of sexual assault and harassment. The #MeToo and Time’s Up movements have shaken our country to its core, as survivors have joined together, forming a beautiful chorus of voices demanding change and commanding respect.</p>
<p class="p2">As a 19-year-old, this is the first time I feel like part of a historic social movement. Sixty years ago, my grandparents stood on the Lincoln Memorial steps watching Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. deliver his “I Have a Dream” speech. Thirty years ago my parents protested South African apartheid on Embassy Row. And last week, I was happy to be following in their footsteps.</p>
<p class="p2">With this in mind, the idea of participating in this year’s Women’s March seemed important, necessary and cathartic.</p>
<p class="p2">However, the Women’s Marches have not gone without controversy, and the criticisms that many have made against them are important and deserve consideration. Critics argue that the marches lack diversity — are unrepresentative of those who are most acutely affected by our country’s current government.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Others believe the nationwide protests are becoming too “mainstream” and that many of those who are coming to the marches are doing so out of convenience — showing up one day out of the year to check a box, soothe their conscience and get some pictures for their Instagram. In other words, they argue that the protests are inauthentic and ineffective.</p>
<p class="p2">I recognize the validity of these arguments. I, like many others, was taken aback by the lack of diversity at the 2017 Women’s March. And though over the past year the Women’s March has worked hard to respond to its critics (appointing more women of color to its leadership and, as co-chair Tamika Mallory noted in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/01/18/womens-march-more-inclusive-year/1038859001/">USA Today</a>, making “transgender inclusion a priority”), the Women’s March remains far from perfect. Just this fall, when the march’s leadership appointed Bernie Sanders as the headlining speaker for its women’s convention, people were outraged. (Why not get a woman for the women’s convention? Just an idea.)</p>
<p class="p2">Ultimately, the Women’s March’s shortcomings need to be addressed through awareness and education. Pointing out flaws and teaching march organizers and marchers alike about how feminism must be intersectional is the only way to ensure that the Women’s Marches continue to hold the power that they do. If the Women’s March continues to fail to proactively incorporate the opinions and needs of all women, across boundaries of race, class, sexuality and gender expression, they will let down a generation of women. At the end of the day, we shouldn’t give up on the marches, because despite their shortcomings, the strengths and importance of the Women’s Marches cannot be overlooked. The answer isn’t to stop marching. The answer is to listen, to educate and to improve.</p>
<p class="p2">At the march this year, after reading a few articles critiquing the protests, I came in a bit skeptical. But when I arrived, I was overwhelmed by an energy which I hadn’t felt since last January — an atmosphere of hope, unity and solidarity. The Smithsonian Mall was transformed into an empowering sea of knowing smiles, supportive nods and friendly waves. Walking around the reflection pool, holding my mom’s hand and waving my sign high, I felt like a part of something important. And, all around me, I saw women and men from a variety of backgrounds, joining together with a common purpose. This isn’t a sight you see every day.</p>
<p class="p2">I was reassured of the need for the Women’s March to continue throughout the era of President Trump, not just to accomplish policy goals, but to build solidarity amongst all those affected by the rhetoric and actions of the Trump administration. At its best, the Women’s March can inspire women of all backgrounds — instilling them with a confidence which, in a society that is constantly tearing girls down, is hard to come by.</p>
<p class="p4"><em>Maya Fitzpatrick ’20 definitely did not post about the Women’s March on Instagram and can be reached at maya_gonzales_fitzpatrick@brown.edu.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Among the scientists, environmentalists and investors on the advisory council of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society sits Warren Kanders ’79. Kanders is the chairman of The Safariland Group, described in his profile on <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/institute-environment-society/people/advisory-council">IBES’ website</a> as “manufacturers of safety, survivability and other products for the law enforcement and military markets.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kanders has played a consistent and prominent role in developing the supply of and market for crowd-control weapons globally. The Safariland Group emerged from a conglomeration of body armor companies. As chairman and chief executive of Armor Holdings, Inc., Kanders laid the foundation for The Safariland Group by overseeing the acquisition of American Body Armor and Safariland in the late 1990s. In the intervening years, BAE Systems bought Armor Holdings and ultimately sold it back to an affiliate of Kanders &amp; Company in 2012, at which point the company name became <a href="https://www.safariland.com/timeline/our-history-landing.html">The Safariland Group</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kanders’ company supplies many crowd-control weapons used by law enforcement and military agencies around the world. <a href="https://safariland-llc.dcatalog.com/v/2018-Products-Catalog/#page=176">Safariland’s catalogs</a>, including its 2018 product catalog, have a section offering “less lethal” impact munitions, smoke bombs and riot control grenades. From Egypt to the occupied Palestinian territories, Ferguson to Standing Rock, the weapons sold and promoted by The Safariland Group <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/ferguson-tear-gas_n_5679931.html">have been used to suppress protests</a>, maim or kill activists and intimidate social movements.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Less lethal weapons and crowd-control weapons are designed to inflict pain and temporarily impair movement without penetrating the body or causing serious injury. According to a 2014 American Civil Liberties Union report, law enforcement agencies worldwide increasingly rely on crowd-control weapons when confronting popular protests. However, the terms “less lethal” and “non-lethal” do not mean that protesters walk away unscathed. A <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/lethal_in_disguise_inclo_single_page.pdf">2016 study</a> by the International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations and Physicians for Human Rights <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/reports/lethal-in-disguise.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/">reported</a> the widespread and devastating physical — and, at times, fatal — impact of crowd-control weapons. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The impact of The Safariland Group’s weapons has been documented across the world. War Resisters League, the “oldest secular pacifist organization in the United States” according to its <a href="https://www.warresisters.org/about-us">website</a>, alleges that tear gas canisters manufactured by a Safariland Group subsidiary were used against protesters in Cairo in <a href="https://www.warresisters.org/defense-technology-safariland-federal-laboratories">2011</a>. B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights nonprofit, released a <a href="https://www.btselem.org/download/201212_crowd_control_eng.pdf">report</a> co-sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme on the use of tear gas in the West Bank — Palestinian territory occupied by Israeli forces — that clearly mentions that Israeli forces utilize weapons manufactured by a Safariland Group subsidiary as well. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to its catalog, The Safariland Group’s rubber bullets are widely used by law enforcement for crowd maintenance or “single subject compliance.” In the United States, protests in Ferguson, Missouri and other police confrontations with the Black Lives Matter movement included “indiscriminate use of tear gas, disorientation devices, acoustic devices, beanbag rounds and rubber bullets,” <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/lethal_in_disguise_inclo_single_page.pdf">according to the ACLU</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><a href="http://www.stltoday.com/gallery/news/multimedia/protests-arrests-continue-monday-in-ferguson/collection_3cb71990-8eb8-5328-aeda-bd0d4bed7198.html#14">The St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/jonswaine/status/499207314918764545/photo/1">Guardian journalist</a> both identified weapons used against Ferguson protesters as those of a Safariland Group subsidiary. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 2016, law enforcement used water cannons, tear gas and other crowd-control weapons against hundreds of unarmed water protectors opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline in Standing Rock, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/21/dakota-access-pipeline-water-cannon-police-standing-rock-protest">resulted</a> in 26 hospitalizations and around 300 injuries. Images posted by the nonprofit media organization Unicorn Riot allege that The Safariland Group’s weapons were used at the site; multiple reports have confirmed that crowd-control weapons were used at Standing Rock, though they do not make specific mention of The Safariland Group. <a href="https://www.salon.com/2016/12/06/i-didnt-want-the-world-to-see-me-like-this-sioux-z-suffers-permanent-injury-after-police-attack-with-tear-gas-canister/">A Navajo woman</a>, Vanessa Dundon, lost sight in her right eye after she was shot in the face with a tear gas canister. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/dakota-pipeline-protests/pipeline-protesters-decry-excessive-force-after-woman-s-arm-blown-n687326">That same night</a>, a concussion grenade hit a 21-year-old woman bringing water to others at the camp and blew the bone out of her arm. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The use of crowd-control weapons harms the people fighting for the future of human rights, the environment and our society. It is shocking that IBES disregarded Kanders’ connections to the suppression of social justice movements and that his role in the company did not prevent his selection as part of the advisory council. <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/president/advisory-groups/advisory-councils">According to the President’s office website</a>, the selection of the members of advisory councils is based on a member’s “expertise or experience” that can offer “valued perspectives on the areas of interest.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given the social and environmental record of The Safariland Group, we have to ask: Were IBES — an organization dedicated to researching environment and society — and the President’s office not aware of the company’s business? What sort of expertise does Kanders bring that contributes to the Institute’s stated commitment to preparing “future leaders to envision and build a just and sustainable world”? </span></p>
<p class="p2">We cannot pretend that the decision to place someone in a position of power exists in a vacuum. Through our actions, we demonstrate our beliefs and we reinforce, or, as in this case, contradict our ambitious rhetoric. IBES and the President’s office’s decision indicates their tacit support of the increased militarization of U.S. law enforcement. In addition, the less lethal weapons market continues to expand despite incidents of death and injury related to the use of tear gas and other less lethal weapons. The Safariland Group, created under years of guidance and leadership by Kanders, sells weapons used against people challenging the status quo and prevents physical demonstrations.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By aligning himself with IBES, Kanders can greenwash his career in the crowd-control weapons industry — covering up his culpability in human rights violations by appearing to support environmentally progressive causes. IBES, by inviting Kanders to sit on its advisory council, effectively condones Kanders’ attempts to reframe The Safariland Group’s work as being in the public’s interest.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Someone who owns a company that is directly involved in suppressing movements — many of which are actively combating the environmental and social issues that IBES exists to address — should not have an advisory role or any other role at Brown. As alums, we are proud to have attended an institution that prides itself on critical engagement and scholarship. Having Kanders on the IBES council reflects neither.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Updated on Feb. 9, 2018 at 12:08 a.m.</strong>
<p class="p1">If distinction is the rubble of five historic buildings, then by all means Brown is building on distinction. The University plans to break ground on a new performing arts center in a location currently occupied by the Urban Environmental Lab — the epicenter of undergraduate environmentalism at Brown — in addition to a community garden and four other historic buildings. One of the buildings will be relocated, but the rest, including the UEL, will be <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/03/u-hopes-open-performing-arts-center-fall-2021/">destroyed</a>. Though cognizant of Brown’s desire to provide the performing arts community with a space that suits its needs, we respectfully yet adamantly oppose the current plan. Not only is this location strategically inappropriate for the theater, but the departmental damage and historic loss inflicted by its erection would be devastating to the Providence community.</p>
<p class="p2">Since its inception, the UEL has prioritized the community and its relationship to the space; students helped with the design of the building as well as the physical renovations. At its completion in 1982, the retrofitted building was on the forefront of sustainable design for its pioneering self-sufficiency and use of passive solar energy.</p>
<p class="p2">When news of the UEL’s planned demolition reached students, the change seemed inevitable. When we, as environmental studies concentrators, began to mobilize to avert its destruction or integrate sustainable design elements into the performing arts center, we were told to direct our attention the renovation of Arnold Lab, the glorified hallway where the environmental studies program was to relocate. The time to intervene, we were told, was three years ago.</p>
<p class="p2">Not until recently did Brown’s duplicity become clear. Just days before winter break, we caught wind of a Providence City Plan Commission hearing Dec. 19 that was slated to review Brown’s most recent developmental initiatives — including the performing arts center. After receiving testimony from the public, the Commission was to approve or reject the plan — though they ultimately voted to postpone their decision until March 20. Contrary to our impression, Brown had not received official permission to execute the project, despite already hiring an architect, according to President Paxson’s P’19 Corporation recap from spring 2017.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Because the Commission meeting fell in late December, most Brown students were either home or studying for finals. Many concerned students were unable to attend — though the two of us managed to go. In addition, the meeting was attended by dozens of community members, all of whom opposed construction of a performing arts center at the Angell Street location. They argued that the development would result in a lack of parking, needless erasure of history and a brutal attack on the character of College Hill. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Representatives from Brown assured those present that their concerns had been adequately addressed. However, they explained their reasoning with conflicting and misleading claims. When asked about the problem of parking in and around the new theater, the representatives from Brown responded by explaining that the University’s current theaters have a similar capacity to the proposed performing arts center and that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>these existing theaters haven’t struggled with parking in the past.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite what they said at the meeting, Brown does not have a theater with similar capacity to the proposed performing arts center. The new center will seat <a href="https://www.brown.edu/facilities/sites/facilities/files/IMP2017-Amendment1_20171113-FINAL.pdf">500 individuals</a>, while Brown’s largest performing arts space<a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/theatre-arts-performance-studies/about-department/facilities?"> holds just 240</a>. Brown may well benefit from a larger performing arts center, but considering Brown’s plans to build a wellness center in the place of the largest parking lot in the vicinity, Brown’s lack of transparency and misdirection around the issue of parking betray an indifference to the quality of life of College Hill residents.</span></p>
<p class="p2">As students, it strikes us as ill-thought out and absurd that a new performance venue is to be built within a stone’s throw of four other theaters on campus: The Perry and Marty Granoff Center for the Creative Arts, Leeds Theatre, Stuart Theatre and Alumnae Hall are all within a tenth of a mile from the proposed construction location. To be clear, we’re not opposed to the expansion of performing arts at Brown and would support opportunities to realize this project elsewhere. However, there is more at stake than the redundancy of the construction or the services provided by the UEL. The entire character of College Hill is in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="p2">This disrespect for the community goes even further. Regardless of the need for a theater or the impracticality of building atop a bus tunnel and within feet of four other theaters, the eradication of historic buildings undermines an important contract that Brown has with the City of Providence. As a university, Brown is bound by <a href="https://www.providenceri.gov/efile/5786.pdf">Providence zoning ordinances</a> to preserve “neighborhood character, historic resources and consistency with the City’s Comprehensive Plan and adopted land use policies.” The loss of the UEL and its surroundings marks not just a disregard for that ordinance, but a continuation of a trend that has cost College Hill far too many historic buildings.</p>
<p class="p2">The UEL has played a substantial role in the history of College Hill. Built in 1885 as a carriage house, the building called Johnstone and later the Lucian Sharpe Carriage House underwent many changes before becoming what it is today. Originally the space served as a stable for the hotel across the street before the University bought it for storage and transformed it into the hub it is today. The UEL and the four surrounding buildings are essential to the neighborhood character of College Hill, as evidenced by their position on the Providence Preservation Society’s <a href="http://ppsri.org/most-endangered-properties/2018-mep-list">list of most endangered properties</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Since its conception, Brown has successfully repurposed <a href="http://ppsri.org/most-endangered-properties/2018-mep-list">numerous extant buildings</a>; however, it has demolished at least a hundred more to make way for modern infrastructural expansions. As one resident made clear at the hearing, Brown may not remove all the historic buildings at once, but when a few are left in isolation they lose context and become vulnerable to future demolition. We’ve seen this with the original urban studies building, destroyed to facilitate expansion of the School of Engineering building in 2015. The University seems to take for granted just how important these historic spaces are to past, current and prospective students, but, most of all, to the residents of College Hill. Luckily, it’s not too late to save the UEL and the four historic buildings in its vicinity. But time is running out to ensure that an important piece of Providence history is not lost forever, and, with it, a vital connection to our neighbors on College Hill.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Math dictates almost every process in our lives: It can determine if an infectious disease will become an epidemic, how quickly a biochemical system will reach its equilibrium and the circumstances under which a certain species will become extinct. However, though I am firm in my conviction that math is the single most important system of thought discovered on our planet, I don’t think it has any place in human romantic interactions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Recently, the Blognonian paired with the Harvard Computer Society to bring to Brown an edition of Datamatch — a matchmaking service in which over 60 percent of Harvard’s campus participates, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/165153197597418/">according to its organizers</a>. The premise of Datamatch is to use mathematical algorithms to assign students their “perfect match.” Though math can account for an infinite number of phenomena, how can it perfectly predict interpersonal chemistry? More importantly, should we aim to improve artificial intelligence to the point that it can assign us our “perfect match?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Black Mirror,” a British television series proudly touted by Netflix, often depicts dystopias in which technology rules all interpersonal interactions. In the series’ most recent season, the episode “Hang the DJ” highlights what romantic and sexual exploration would look like if every participant had a device that could predict the outcomes of their potential relationships. The data compiled from one’s series of relationships — that could last hours or years — ultimately promised to lead the users to their 100 percent match: in other words, their soulmate.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As millennials, we have been indulged by instant gratification: Instagram “likes” immediately invalidate our insecurities, and Facebook reactions remind us that we have online communities that support our ideas and pursuits. The most dangerous factors to consider, when contemplating systems such as Datamatch, are the instant gratification and the false sense of certainty they provide us. Why endure the “ghosting,” the ignored texts, the meaningless hookups, the heartbreak and emotional torment that the pursuit of love often entails when we can answer tangential questions such as “Why do you take classes S/NC?” and be delivered our “perfect match?” The simplicity of the question above (provided by Datamatch) is not universal across all dating applications, but the underlying fallacy remains blatantly clear: No data can truly predict the chemistry between two (or more) individuals.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A fundamental element in solving most mathematical proofs is the “if and only if” statement. In using this step to prove a conclusion, we must prove that event A causes event B and vice versa. In this case, can we prove that if we participate in mathematically-founded systems such as Datamatch, we will find our “perfect match?” If we find our “perfect match,” will it be a result of participation in Datamatch’s services?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When I was growing up, my mom always told me “opposites attract.” Maybe this was to justify that she, the woman who becomes friends with every cashier at Stop and Shop, married my father, who wears soundproof headphones around the house to avoid conversation. Some couples, regardless of sexual orientation or identity, prefer to be with those who share identical characteristics, whereas some want to be with those who supply the very characteristics they lack. How can we rely on algorithms and internet applications to dictate what is “perfect” for us when we ourselves often don’t know what we’re looking for in a relationship until it’s right in front of us?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The theorems of Pythagoras and the methods of Euler and Newton have maintained their immutability as universal truths since their logical conceptions. However, in a time when our world is constantly being shattered and glued back together by technological and social processes, it is impossible for human interactions to not be impacted by temporal circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Furthermore, even if we were to live in a vacuum untouched by scientific, technological and social advancements, math still would be unable to assign us our “perfect match.” In Oscar E. Fernandez’s “The Calculus of Happiness: How a Mathematical Approach to Life Adds Up to Health, Wealth and Love,” the mathematician and Wellesley College professor attempts to estimate N, the maximum number of potential partners one could possibly have based on a number of variables: P represents the population from which you would like to find your partner, S is the fraction of the population of the desired sex, A the fraction within the desired age range, E the fraction within the stratum of desired educational attainment, D the fraction that is available, H1 the fraction you would want to date and finally, H2 representing the fraction who would date you.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><b>N=(P)(S)(A)(E)(D)(H1)(H2)</b></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The product of all of the variables above is supposed to give a rough estimate of the potential number of partners who could be a “perfect match.” I would like to elaborate on Fernandez’s equation to accommodate sexual preferences and orientations within the two last variables. Even if this equation were to work perfectly, however, it does not account for an individual’s sexual and romantic preferences (of which there are an infinite number) and how they are weighted. It’s impossible to quantify how much it means when your partner gets along with your parents, how they care for you when you are sick or whether they help you with your problem sets. Quite simply, it is impossible to mathematically model love. Math may be infallible in the classroom and the lab, but its influence on our personal lives is far more inconclusive.</span></p>

		<title>Carroll &#039;21: What the Super Bowl riots can teach us about race in America</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On the night of Super Bowl Sunday, football fans took to the streets of Philadelphia after the Eagles pulled off a historic upset in Super Bowl LII, bringing the team their first championship title. However, the fun quickly turned to chaos as fans began to tear through the streets, causing damage in their wake.</p>
<p class="p2">Videos surfaced online of out-of-control fans flipping cars, setting fires, vandalizing local businesses and even eating horse feces off the ground — yes, you read that right. In spite of the widespread mayhem that ravaged downtown Philadelphia that Sunday night, for some reason the resulting media reaction has been rather tempered. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2018/02/05/philly-celebration-turns-rowdy-after-eagles-win-super-bowl.html">Fox News</a> classified the riots that destroyed parts of Philadelphia as a “celebration” and “rowdy,” and <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/raucous-celebrations-and-riots-erupt-philadelphia-fans-celebrate-eagles-799352">Newsweek</a> reported that the “raucous celebrations” got “out of hand.”</p>
<p class="p2">However, the story is told rather differently when black Americans take to the streets. Blatant and upfront racism has been replaced by a similarly dangerous, but harder to recognize set of racial double-standards. In recent years, Black Lives Matter protesters have frequently been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/01/27/578980821/labeled-a-terrorist-a-black-lives-matter-founder-writes-her-record">accused</a> of being “thugs” by media outlets, particularly Fox News. The founders of the Black Lives Matter movement like Patrisse Cullors and its members across the nation more generally have been accused of being literal terrorists. However, TV media outlets largely lost their harsh tone when referring to the majority-white Philadelphia rioters with Fox News referring to the latter as “boisterous fans.”</p>
<p class="p2">The discrepancy in coverage of predominantly-white and predominantly-black demonstrations is not a new phenomenon. One can point to the many violent riots caused by predominantly-white youth after sporting events and the lack of media response as evidence of prejudice. For example, the Michigan State <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/10000-fans-riot-in-michigan/">riots</a> after a loss to Duke in the 1999 NCAA Final Four resulted in over 100 arrests and damage assessments as high as $500,000, and the 2012 University of Kentucky <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/university-kentucky-fans-overturn-cars-burn-couches-celebrate-final-win-louisville-article-1.1054059">riots</a> saw an estimated 10,000 fans amass in the streets after a win against rival Louisville.</p>
<p class="p2">The difference in the way that black protesters and white rioters are characterized in society demonstrates the state of racism in America today. Consider Fox News <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-fox-news-hate-group_us_55e5c102e4b0b7a9633a3b12">suggesting</a> that Black Lives Matter is a “murder movement” in 2015 or <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-news-charlottesville_us_59907720e4b090964297b9d3">comparing</a> Charlottesville Neo-Nazis and white supremacists to Black Lives Matter protesters in 2017. The “N-word” has been replaced by the word “thug.” The explicit denouncement of blacks in America as dangerous has been replaced by cloaked insinuations hidden in the statements of news pundits.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In recent years, black Americans have raised questions over the way the mainstream media disproportionately portrays blacks as dangerous or criminalistic. For example, in 2014, media coverage of the infamous police shooting of African American teenager Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked widespread controversy. Young blacks from all over America chimed in to criticize media outlets’ apparent attempts to portray Brown as a malefactor — the media eschewed flattering photos of Brown with family or at his graduation and instead used rough photos of Brown on the street or with his middle finger raised.</span></p>
<p class="p2">These events spurred the “If They Gunned Me Down (What Photo Would They Use)” online campaign in which young black Americans contrasted positive and negative photos of themselves and pondered which ones the media would choose to run should they become victims of police brutality or racially-motivated gun violence. One viral post showed a young woman in a military uniform alongside a picture of her holding a bottle of vodka. Another <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/08/11/339592009/people-wonder-if-they-gunned-me-down-what-photo-would-media-use">showed</a> a man in a gold chain and a T-shirt juxtaposed with a picture of him walking across the stage at his graduation.</p>
<p class="p2">Similar allegations of racial bias and subsequent public outcry have arisen. Notably, the public has denounced distorted and tasteless coverage in moments like the media investigation of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin’s private life after his fatal shooting in 2012, which included speculation about Martin’s academic transcript and school record. Another common practice is to refer to black minors like Martin and 12-year-old police shooting victim Tamir Rice as “men” or “adults,” while older white men who committed atrocities such as mass murders and rape — like Dylann Roof, Nikolas Cruz and Brock Turner — are referred to as “boys.” By contrast, the policeman who shot Rice perceived him not as a 12-year-old playing in a park but as a “maybe 20” year old threat, as he <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7297265/tamir-rice-age-police">described</a> Rice immediately after fatally shooting him. These media practices are poorly veiled attempts to demonize the victims of racially-motivated violence and police brutality, while giving white perpetrators of violence the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p class="p2">Black America needs to keep calling out the racialized media coverage present in this country. The messages that people receive from television and other media surrounding race play an important part in how we interact with society. And as the deaths of Martin and Rice make clear, this distorted coverage has concerning implications for how people of color are viewed in the world. We need to work toward an America where black civil rights protesters aren’t called terrorists and threats to society if white college students destroying cities after a football game are simply “kids” and “boisterous fans.”</p>

		<title>McDonald: Paxson’s promotion of Prospect Medical Holdings is irresponsible</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">President Christina Paxson P’19 has been telling Rhode Islanders for weeks now that she wants the University to team up with Prospect Medical Holdings, Inc., a California-based for-profit, to acquire Care New England, a non-profit and the second largest health care system in Rhode Island. <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/01/cne">According to Paxson</a>, “Prospect has a national reputation for operating quality, cost-efficient healthcare facilities.” We at the United Nurses &amp; Allied Professionals think that Paxson has it wrong. When it comes to patient safety, Prospect has proven itself an unreliable and ineffective provider of health care, and Rhode Islanders deserve better.</p>
<p class="p2">Last spring, Prospect’s own consultants found that <a href="http://wpri.com/2017/09/29/unap-claiming-contaminated-tools-used-in-operating-room-at-fatima-hospital/">surgical instruments</a> in the operating room at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence — which is majority-owned and operated by Prospect — were contaminated with foreign material and otherwise worn, cracked or broken, thereby putting patients at risk. Prospect is now being investigated by the National Labor Relations Board, under the National Labor Relations <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/01-CA-200126">Act</a>, for refusing to make the consultant’s report public. Prospect is also being investigated by the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/01-CA-214788">NLRB</a> for refusing to make information relating to additional deficiencies public.</p>
<p class="p2">On Dec. 27, 2017, the <a href="https://pbn.com/four-r-hospitals-penalized-high-patient-injury-infection-rates/">Providence Business News</a> reported that here in Rhode Island, the federal government reduced the reimbursement rates at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital and Roger Williams Medical Center — also majority owned and operated by Prospect — for high patient injury and infection rates. Both hospitals ﬁnished in the bottom 25 percent of 3,306 hospitals surveyed across the country.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to a 2016 article that ran in the<a href="http://www.journalinquirer.com/towns/manchester/prospect-unclean-feds-find/article_b1ac7516-f5ca-11e5-bcbc-fb9b1b82a744.html"> Journal Inquirer</a>, a Connecticut newspaper, the federal government had to shut down a Prospect surgical unit in California for eight days because of a widespread risk of patient infection. In addition, several of Prospect’s California hospitals were cited for inappropriately staffed intensive care units, improper storage of biohazardous waste, failure to appropriately store and administer patient medications, failure to ensure that medical staff were professionally qualified and catheterizations of patients without doctor’s orders.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Prospect’s failures do not end there. Prospect recently purchased a hospital system in Pennsylvania — <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-transactions-and-valuation/prospect-medical-holdings-to-pay-300m-for-crozer-keystone.html">Crozer-Keystone Health System</a>. <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/business/labor_and_unions/crozer-keystone-foundation-prospect-agree-to-arbitrate-21-5m-dispute-20170623.html">Under Pennsylvania law</a>, Prospect was required to put the proceeds of the sale into a community foundation charged with the responsibility of providing health care-related services to local residents. When Prospect reneged on this obligation, the foundation took the matter to arbitration. Finding that Prospect was in the wrong, Prospect was ordered to make a payment of approximately $21 million to the <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/business/crozer-keystone-community-foundation-wins-arbitrator-decision-against-prospect-medical-20171110.html">foundation</a>. Adding insult to injury, Prospect was late in making the court-ordered payment into escrow. Also in Pennsylvania, Prospect<a href="http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20170930/NEWS/170939997"> tax payment checks</a> to three local school districts bounced to the tune of several million dollars.</p>
<p class="p2">Paxson is most certainly entitled to her own opinion, but she is not entitled to her own facts. Prospect does not have a national reputation for operating quality, cost-efficient health care facilities, and Brown University should not put its reputation and finances at risk by doing business with the likes of Prospect Medical Holdings.</p>
<p class="p4"><em>Linda McDonald is a registered nurse and the president of United Nurses &amp; Allied Professionals, a union that represents health care workers employed in Rhode Island, Vermont and Connecticut and advocates for high-quality patient care. UNAP represents over 600 health care workers employed at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital and is involved in a labor dispute with Prospect Medical Holdings.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The PTP is sometimes criticized for this approach and, significantly, for welcoming financial support not only from liberal but also from conservative and libertarian donors. For example, <a href="http://www.unkochmycampus.org/jan-23-2018-brown-university-faculty-letter/">a recent blog post</a>, written anonymously by a Brown faculty member, criticized the PTP for bringing Noam Chomsky to Brown, claiming we hosted Chomsky, and featured his picture on our website, as a “smokescreen” to hide a right-wing agenda. But Professor Chomsky is not the only left-leaning speaker the PTP has brought to campus. In recent years, we have also hosted Jeffrey Sachs, Jessica Valenti, Stanley Fish, Brad DeLong, Lani Guinier, Larry Lessig, Michael Eric Dyson, Sven Beckert, Randi Weingarten, Glenn Greenwald, Rick Ross, Michael Sandel, Jerry Greenfield from Ben &amp; Jerry’s and many others. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Still, Brown is a famously innovative and contrarian university, so with PTP events there is a twist. PTP events routinely feature not just one but two speakers, presenting students with dueling perspectives. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQD6qeCb_0&amp;list=PLTiEffrOcz_4YIz1QvotlAPz9s8GwYa5F&amp;index=5&amp;t=0s">our Chomksy event</a> was on America’s relationship with Israel, so we paired him with Ambassador Dennis Ross, who provided counterpoints. When the PTP brought Bill McKibben to Brown to discuss coal divestment, we also brought James Rogers, the CEO of Duke Energy. For an event on human rights and torture, we brought together Larry Cox, the executive director of Amnesty International, and John Yoo. When Catharine MacKinnon spoke about gender equality, we paired her with Harvard’s Harvey Mansfield (the author, for better or worse, of a book entitled “Manliness”). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">PTP events are popular at Brown because they are designed based on the principle of respect for undergraduates. We don’t see students as passive creatures who attend university to be corrected by their moral superiors. Instead, we believe that a great university, above all else, owes each generation of students a chance to think for themselves. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What about our critics? They do not like the PTP, and they fear the idealism that an approach like ours inspires. They believe college students should not have the opportunity (or even the desire) to interact with cutting edge scholars on various sides of controversial issues. Instead, they seek to sanitize the university. In their dream, Brown would not be a garden with flowers blooming in surprising directions and hues, but a place where every sprout of difference has been rooted out, and the campus painted over with a monochromatic ideology of their own liking. Conformity is their goal. Their attack on donors they dislike is the smokescreen they use to hide this fact.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> It is revealing that criticisms of the PTP have often been built upon innuendo and simple factual errors. For example, few years ago, a book on “dark money” claimed that I received a grant of roughly $150,000 from an outside foundation to teach a seminar at Brown. That is false. That author also made much of a misquote — originally presented, ironically, in a conservative magazine — to the effect that I see the aim of my teaching as indoctrination when the opposite is true. The anonymous blog post that I mentioned above recycled that misquotation, and additionally asserted that I was awarded a $50,000 book prize from a foundation which also supports the PTP. Alas, that too is false. Critics of the PTP routinely mischaracterize my own political views, describing me as an exponent of unbridled capitalism. In fact, my life’s work has been to reconcile advocates of private economic liberty to the moral imperatives of social justice (and vice versa).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The PTP is committed to transparency. Indeed, we have a long-standing policy of listing our major donors on our website, even though Brown does not require us to do so. (Brown also discloses donor information in its Annual Financial Report.) What’s more, the PTP publicly states the principles of philanthropic partnership on which we are willing to accept financial support. The main principle, closely modeled on Brown’s own policy under President Christina Paxson P’19, is what we call “Programming First.” The PTP allows donors no input regarding any of our activities. Programming First is a kind of public contract: If any donor wishes to support the PTP, they must do so entirely on our terms.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Increasingly, there are powerful groups seeking to create a university of conformity. They may succeed elsewhere, but not at Brown. For pluralism is the very essence of Brown. It is in our DNA.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While other Ivy League schools were founded on religious charters, Brown was different from the start. Brown’s Charter of 1764 states: “(I)t is hereby enacted and declared that into this liberal and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests: But, on the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full, free and absolute and unlimited liberty of conscience.” In 1969, the students who devised the New Curriculum had a similar idea: Instead of one mandated curriculum imposed upon all, they insisted that, at Brown, each student should be free to experiment and devise a unique path of study for themselves. So too, in her convocation address in 2001, former president Ruth Simmons declared, “While other types of communities devise covenants so as to avoid conflict, our covenant is rooted in quarrel, in opposition. We freely trespass boundaries, criticize each other’s views, test every theory. No idea is beyond range or out of bounds.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Today at Brown, many centers, departments, faculty members and students remember, and seek to honor, Brown’s tradition of pluralism. At the PTP, our commitment to pluralism is not only on behalf of our students: It is fundamental to our mission as scholars. The PTP has increasingly become an intellectual junction box at Brown, bringing together “quarrelsome” insights from the disciplines of philosophy, politics, economics and others. At the PTP, we study differences not only for the sake of difference, but as a method to discover commonalities that might inspire us all. I invite you to join us in this great adventure.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the past few months, we have seen the narrative that Brown’s PTP is a corrupted right-wing think tank at the mercy of the Koch brothers gain acceptance on campus. This narrative alleges that the “Koch-backed” Political Theory Project has an agenda to manipulate helpless Brown students into supporting free market economics. As a Brown student who has engaged in PTP programming, I find these allegations to be not only erroneous, but also insulting. The PTP serves a valuable role in cultivating a forum for vibrant and rigorous intellectual discourse on our campus. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The argument underlying this narrative is that the PTP is a pawn of a Koch brothers-funded scheme to “convert” Brown students into right-wing ideologues. The accusations are made on the assumption that Koch brother donations carry with them a certain contingency — that the PTP engage in the espousal of a “right-wing agenda.” These accusations are demonstrably false. As Professor Tomasi explained in his recent op-ed, “The PTP publicly states the principles of philanthropic partnership on which we are willing to accept financial support. … The PTP allows donors no input regarding any of our activities. … If any donor wishes to support the PTP, they must do so entirely on our terms.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The narrative also implies that the scholarship output of the PTP is decidedly one-sided and biased, intended to further the Koch-backed right-wing agenda. In his October column, Herald opinions editor Anuj Krishnamurthy focuses on two papers from 2010 and 2011 and argues that they, in their advocacy of deregulation, are indicative of a conflict of interest. Krishnamurthy points to these papers as clear evidence that the scholarly output of the PTP is driven by Koch brother interests. In my view, this argument is false and incomplete — two finance-focused papers from seven years ago hardly constitute compelling evidence of deep-rooted Koch brother influence. In reality, the aggregate scholarly output of the PTP is diverse and nuanced, focusing on a range of topics and disciplines. For example, Associate Director Daniel D’Amico focuses his research on the comparative analysis of criminal justice systems across societies to study the structural economic and political incentives that determine the extent to which nations jail. Indeed, one could survey the PTP’s current collection of professors and post-doctoral research associates and find that its scholarship is largely independent of any<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Koch-inspired agenda.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ironically, in Professor Tomasi and Professor D’Amico’s class, POLS 1150: “Prosperity: The Ethics and Economics of Wealth Creation,” my classmates and I were able to participate in a direct conversation with Charles Koch during which I had the opportunity to question Koch’s perspective on climate change and policy. Koch made himself entirely open to constructive criticisms and questions. In giving us this opportunity for open debate, both the director and associate director for the PTP made clear their commitment to allow room for pushback. This contradicts the theory that the PTP’s sole reason for existing is right-wing indoctrination.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a student, I have thoroughly enjoyed the thoughtful courses taught by the PTP’s professors, as well as its Janus Forum lectures. Not only are these events intellectually stimulating, but they are predicated on a commitment to exposing students to a diversity of perspectives and helping them form their own opinions. I have greatly appreciated how committed the PTP is to presenting multiple rigorously informed perspectives on a range of issues. The fundamental purpose of the Janus Forum lectures is to give opposing voices time to make their case and debate one another.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The mission and practice of the PTP is not only admirable but also vital to facilitating thriving intellectual discourse. It is of the utmost importance that students are able to expose themselves to diverse academic scholarship so that they can come to their own well-informed conclusions. Through its funding of freethinking student publications like the Brown Journal of Philosophy, Politics and Economics and the Brown Political Review, as well as its sponsorship of campus lectures and programs, the PTP is undeniably a foundational treasure of our campus. The PTP ought to be celebrated for its commitment to academic rigor and free thinking, rather than falsely framed as a manipulative pawn of dark outside forces.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In response to recent debate about the Brown Political Theory Project, we feel the need to warn students that the PTP is not a center for “thriving intellectual discourse,” in the words of Daniel Shemano ’19. Instead, we must be critical of what it means to have a political center on our campus that has received significant contributions from the Charles Koch Foundation. We ask students to consider the history of Koch money in our country and reject the claims that the PTP exists to contribute to our academic community at Brown. The <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180224/koch-funnels-millions-into-brown-riling-left">millions in Koch money</a> on our campus threaten our values and our community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Charles and David Koch have a long history of influencing American politics and institutions to advance their own interests, particularly those related to their petrochemical business, Koch Industries. They have been explicit about their use of universities toward this goal: Charles Koch, in a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/connor-gibson/to-charles-koch-universit_b_9090404.html">1974 speech</a>, said they should only support universities that “contribute in some way to our individual companies or to the general welfare of our free enterprise system.” Thus, Koch’s contributions cast serious doubt on the PTP’s “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/25/tomasi-political-theory-project-essence-brown/">commitment to pluralism</a>”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— instead, they fit into the Kochs’ broader scheme, one with a strict ideological agenda. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 2013, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/10/spreading-the-free-market-gospel/413239/">the Atlantic reported</a> that the two private charitable institutions owned by Charles Koch had donated a total of more than $19.3 million to 210 colleges and universities across the country in 2012 alone. As the Atlantic reported, “Koch officials routinely cultivate relationships with professors and deans and fund specific courses of economic study pitched by them.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Professor John Tomasi wrote in his recent op-ed that “the PTP allows donors no input regarding any of our activities.” We don’t doubt this is true, but it would be absurd to think that the Charles Koch Foundation donated $3.2 million to the PTP out of pure benevolence. The Kochs make these donations to support their anti-government, “free market” agenda in order to safeguard their wealth and power. And this is not purely conjecture. According to the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/koch-funded-academics-bring-free-market-ideology-trump-administration-2624003">International Business Times</a>, the Koch brothers have long considered universities to be “the foundation of their ‘Structure of Social Change,’ an effort to convert Americans to libertarianism and push through steep tax cuts and deregulation.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Kochs’ donations may not be explicitly quid pro quo, but we are confident that if the PTP’s scholarship strayed from the Kochs’ radical agenda, the Kochs would cut funding to the PTP and start afresh with a new charismatic professor and a new project to support. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The evidence of this influence bleeds through the PTP’s well-manicured website. In his <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/02/shemano-19-in-defense-of-the-political-theory-project/">op-ed</a>, Shemano claimed that “indeed, one could survey the PTP’s current collection of professors and post-doctoral research associates and find that its scholarship is largely independent of any Koch-inspired agenda.” We did in fact survey the PTP’s professors, and their CVs are littered with oil-stained Koch fingerprints. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Looking at the ‘People’ page of the PTP’s website, you will notice that everyone but Professor Tomasi received their economics PhDs from George Mason University. Charles Koch has donated $96 million to George Mason University, where he established the Mercatus Center — a heavily-endowed incubator for radical libertarian ideology. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But it doesn’t stop there: PTP professors pad their bios with academic awards they’ve received. Most of them come from Koch-affiliated institutions. Take the “Gordon Tullock Prize” that PTP Professors Emily Skarbek and Daniel D’Amico list in their bios: Unsurprisingly, this award is granted by the Center for Study of Public Choice, hosted — where else — but at GMU. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or take the “Israel M. Kirzner Award,” from the Society for the Development of Austrian Economics, of which both Professors D’Amico and David Skarbek boast: Again, unsurprisingly, this is actually just a GMU student award. Furthermore, Tomasi himself received the literal “Charles G. Koch Prize” at, again, GMU. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The fact they received GMU awards and degrees alone is not evidence they are torch-bearers of the Koch ideology, but when you look at the extent of support they’ve received throughout their careers, a clearer picture of the Kochs’ talent pipeline comes together. For example, these professors have also been repeatedly published in Koch and GMU-affiliated journals, like the Review of Austrian Academics, the Public Choice Journal and the Cato Journal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But what is most alarming is that the PTP is employing this same strategy, using Koch Industry money to legitimize a dangerous ideology, at Brown. Students who join the PTP’s Philosophy, Politics and Economics Society are rewarded with $500 and often cite leadership positions on PTP’s undergraduate journal, accolades that in turn give them access to the entire Koch network. This includes internships, research opportunities and eventually jobs, all backed by the same individuals. The Koch’s ‘Talent Pipeline,’ as many call it, starts at Brown. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And let us not forget in this debate that we should be deeply afraid of the Kochs’ agenda, not because we disagree with them but because their ideas are affronts to the legitimacy of our country’s democracy. They have led efforts to gerrymander election maps for Republicans, fought against limits to corporate spending in elections and cultivated the Tea Party, one of the largest astroturf movements in American history. Students should not be fooled. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent weeks, there has been a call for full disclosure about the role that “legacy” status plays in the college admission process at selective institutions. At Brown, legacy applicants are those whose mother or father, or both, received an undergraduate degree from the University, and who seek admission as first-year or transfer students.

Unfortunately, the full disclosure movement is based on long-held and entrenched misunderstanding about the role that legacy plays in the admission process. It has led to speculation that children of alums are admitted at the expense of students who will be the first in their families to attend college, low-income students or others who do not have an immediate connection to Brown. This couldn’t be further from reality. A focus on legacy admissions distracts from what is truly at the heart of the movement, which is how to increase access to Brown for low-income and first-generation students.

The questions that we must address include: How do we get more low-income and first-generation students to apply to Brown? How do we more strongly communicate that Brown is affordable, and that our institution wants to ensure they thrive here? And how do we encourage them to accept Brown’s offer of admission once they are admitted?

Dispelling myths about how Brown considers children of alums in its application process will let us focus squarely on these important questions. The full disclosure movement has asked for any and all documents related to our “policy” about how legacy applicants are considered in the admission process. There is no written policy about how applicants’ status as a child of an alum may be considered in their admission process, because they are reviewed like all other aspirants to Brown — one case at a time, and without the use of formulas or quotas.

First and foremost, we look for academic strength and intellectual curiosity. Our primary mission is to identify young minds that will ask new questions, create new knowledge and be active learners for life. Second, we closely review how students spend their time outside of class. For some, it may be student government; for others, working a part time job or taking care of younger siblings. Third, we seek to understand, from essays, letters of recommendation and alumni interviews, if the student is someone of strong character. This is of critical importance as we build a class and a community.

Only after we have established the foundation of these essential elements do we begin to layer a host of priorities that help guide our work in an ever-more selective admissions environment. We take a vast range of considerations into account, many of which receive more attention than whether or not a student’s parents attended Brown. We are dedicated to strengthening the visual and performing arts, and might look very closely at musicians when trying to identify the cellist who might be needed to fill out the orchestra. We seek out some of the most talented science students, innovators and humanists in the world. And as part of our commitment to building community at Brown, we pay special attention to children of Brown employees, whether that be a faculty member, a member of our grounds staff, or a library employee.

We consider how our student athletes spend innumerable hours training and competing, all while balancing the rigors of academic work. Veterans, children of active duty military and our ROTC cadets represent the very best of this country and are courageous in ways that many of us will never know. And we actively recruit students who will be the first in their families to attend college, because these students demonstrate determination, life experiences and traits of leadership that will help guide our society into the next generation.

So why do we also pay attention to whether an applicant is a child of a Brown alum? Many of these students grew up immersed in the values of Brown. They are often mentors and guides to other students in navigating the University. We see them giving back through BrownConnect by mentoring and developing internship opportunities for Brown students. And yes, they also support Brown’s priorities financially, though this is not the focus. All members of the campus and alumni community benefit from the unique attributes that children of Brown contribute.

And these students reflect the growing diversity of our campus and therefore our alumni base. One in five children of alums who enrolled at Brown this year are students of color. Over the past five years, 29 percent to 39 percent have been students on financial aid. They come from big cities and rural America.

It’s important to understand that each of the many factors outlined here is an example in which the talent or attribute may act as a “tie-breaker” in our process. In cases where an applicant is otherwise extremely well-qualified for admission, the fact that they are a first-gen, ROTC cadet, legacy, or talented artist may prompt us to lean in their direction to build the community that we know will flourish as they process through the Van Wickle Gates.

And this is how we build a diverse class that supports our goals of community. Admitting children of alums does not affect access for first-generation and low-income students. In the Class of 2021, 13 percent are first-generation, 40 percent are students of color and 11 percent are children of Brown alums. The simple reality is that presenting a trade-off between access to Brown for first-generation and low-income students and children of alums is a false dichotomy.

What does affect access is whether or not these talented students know that a place like Brown is possible for them. It’s whether they have the support to understand and navigate the admission process. It’s the availability of financial aid. And it’s resources like the First-Generation College and Low-Income Student Center to help them thrive at Brown.

Our work is successful when we bring students from dramatically different backgrounds together on College Hill, where they will learn and grow together as a class. In the past two years, we have doubled the number of ROTC cadets admitted, doubled the funds available to bring low-income admitted students to campus for A Day on College Hill and increased from three to 30 the number of QuestBridge students (low-income and high achieving students) we admitted through the formal “match” process. And because we learned last year how much of an impact application fees can have, we have waived the application fee for any student who qualifies for free or reduced-price lunch in high school, or who works with a Community Based Organization focused on college access. In addition, increases in financial aid continue to make Brown more affordable, and all students next fall will have the University-packaged loans that used to be part of financial aid packages replaced with scholarships they don’t have to repay. This is through the Brown Promise initiative.

We can, and should, continue our commitment to increased accessibility to Brown. We will continue to expand our efforts to enroll even more low- and moderate-income and first-generation students. At the same time, we should continue to recognize the talents that our legacy applicants bring to campus. This is not a case of either/or. This is a tide that will continue to lift all students.

		<title>Ulichny: Brown’s elementary MAT program gets it right</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As director of the elementary Master in Teaching program from 2000 to 2009, I’d like to make a case for not only continuing the elementary MAT program but financially supporting it more robustly than it has been. During my tenure as director, I authored an annual comprehensive report for four consecutive years to justify the continuation of the program for four different audiences. One such audience included three national experts on teacher education and teacher education reform. After reading our documentation and interviewing students and alums as well as local principals from Providence and Central Falls, they recommended that the program be continued and better funded to support its mission.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The mission of the elementary MAT program, first created in 1998, was specifically tied to educating teachers for urban school careers because of the continuing local and national need for smart, talented and well trained teachers to effect positive change for already vulnerable young people and their families. The program has been very successful in carrying out its mission. Let me give you an example of its effectiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Learning Community, a charter school in Central Falls, opened its doors in 2004 for kindergarten and first grade. After adding a grade level each year, it is now a K-8 school with 573 students who enter via lottery and come from Central Falls, Providence and Pawtucket. The Brown MAT program has been a major feeder of highly successful teachers, coaches and administrators for The Learning Community. Our graduates were hired each year as the school expanded its grade levels so that by the time I left Brown, nearly one half of the teaching faculty at The Learning Community were Brown elementary MAT grads or mentor teachers that we recruited to supervise our students during the SummerPrep experience and in their classrooms, the majority of which were in Providence. I myself have been on the Board of the Learning Community since it began and have been an active participant in many aspects of the school’s development. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to national statistics, The Learning Community’s demographics suggest that it is among the schools that are most likely to fail. It is in the highest poverty district in Rhode Island, with 85 percent of its students qualifying for free and reduced lunch, the public school measure of poverty. Seventy-nine percent of the student body is Latino, 16 percent is black and 5 percent is white. Thirty-two percent of the students are English language learners, and a much higher percentage live in homes where English is not the primary language. Fifteen percent of students are special education classified, which is similar to the percentages of the sending districts, Central Falls, Providence and Pawtucket. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In spite of this statistical profile, which correlates highly with school failure, The Learning Community’s students have defied the odds. On the 2017 Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers’ English Language Arts assessment — a state-wide assessment, 23 percent of R.I. Latino students in grades three to eight were deemed proficient. Fifty percent of white students in all of Rhode Island scored proficient. Fifty-seven percent of The Learning Community’s Latino students scored proficient. That means they closed the achievement gap between white and Latino students by outperforming the state’s white students by 7 percentage points. Furthermore, The Learning Community reached proficiency at two-and-a-half times the rate of their Latino peers statewide. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Math results are also impressive. The proficiency level of students in grades three to seven on the 2017 PARCC Math assessment was 43 percent for white students in Rhode Island, 9 percent for Latino students statewide and 42 percent for Latino students at the Learning Community. The Learning Community was the top performing R.I. urban middle school in math.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While these are extraordinary results, they are even more impressive because The Learning Community is not a test-centered school unlike many expanding, chain urban charter schools. The Learning Community’s students are actively engaged in every classroom, debating their views and explaining their thinking. They have a social justice mission that is realized in concrete projects that enhance the Central Falls community every year. On top of that, The Learning Community, as part of its charter, is committed to bringing what it has learned to urban districts through the Teaching Studio, a professional development entity within the school staffed by teachers at the school. They have worked successfully with Central Falls elementary schools, raising their ELA proficiency rates from the first year of collaboration. Funded by the Rhode Island Foundation and the Kellogg Foundation, they</span><span class="s2"> expanded their work to include Woonsocket, Smithfield and other urban schools.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">There is a great deal that goes into making a school as successful as The Learning Community, but a major part of its success is due to the amazing teachers that work there. The critical mass of Brown elementary MAT graduates who are teachers and administrators has created a nationally recognized school that is doing it right — fulfilling the vision of the first champions of the charter school movement, which is to incubate ideas and share successful practices with their district counterparts. Ted Sizer, former chair of the education department, the greatest influence on the current Brown MAT programs, would be very proud of this legacy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">As the elementary MAT program was taking shape and becoming more urban focused in 2001, The Learning Community was in the planning stages, and my association with the co-directors helped create a common vision of excellent instruction between The Learning Community and the MAT program. We were on the same page from the beginning, having both experienced the positive outcomes of the Reading and Writing Workshop model of instruction developed by Lucy Calkins and colleagues at Teachers College, Columbia University. The main idea behind the workshop model is that whole-class, teacher-led instruction takes place in a mini-lesson of 10 or 15 minutes, which gives students multiple opportunities for active engagement, and the rest of the 60 or 90 minute period allows the teacher to work with individuals or small groups at their particular level. Meanwhile, all students are engaged in doing independent work at their own level of proficiency. In each subject area, students get individualized instruction an average of three times a week. Since 2001, the workshop model — the basic instructional methodology of our MAT program — has been refined and adapted to the needs of an urban school by The Learning Community. It has been expanded to include math and science instruction as The Learning Community developed its own curriculum in those subject areas.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">At The Learning Community, Brown MAT grads are teacher leaders, coaches and some have become administrators, charting the course of the school with the co-directors. Because The Learning Community is very democratically run, teachers create the curriculum for their grade levels and have a lot of say in how the curriculum, instruction and culture of the school unfold. They work very hard, are evaluated rigorously and continue to refine their craft. However, teaching methods are not the only thing that make The Learning Community excel. The co-directors have a vision for a school that deals with the whole child, so there is a large safety net program to assess student learning and to intervene, with additional adults working with small groups of learners, so no child loses ground and falls behind in his or her learning. Of course some do, but they are then even more heavily supported by other adults. Not only is there an instructional safety net but there is also a social-emotional team of social workers and interns who work with students experiencing all sorts of environmental and psychological stressors — including immigration policies that are tearing apart many of the families. Another leg of the stool that supports the excellent outcomes of the school is the involvement of families. The school is a support for many families and caregivers and actively involves them in their children’s education. Parent involvement, as measured by Rhode Island Department of Education criteria, is about 98 percent!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In its current self-study, I understand that Brown’s administration may eliminate some programs that don’t align with its intended focus. In my opinion, however, Brown has a responsibility to enrich the community that hosts it. It is abundantly clear that the elementary MAT program serves the surrounding urban community in tangible and critical ways. It would be a great loss to the children and families of the Providence area urban core if the program were to be eliminated.</span></p>

		<title>Boury ’20: Advocating for ideological diversity at Brown</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2001, newly instated President Ruth Simmons famously responded to controversy surrounding a racist advertisement in The Herald by stating that “it is easy enough to exist in a realm where everyone is like-minded and speaks only of unimportant matters. That’s easy. While comfort may be found in silence, truth cannot dwell there.” Fifteen years later, her successor, President Christina Paxson P’19, stressed the importance of freedom of expression on college campuses in her 2016 convocation speech, likening the censorship of ideas in universities to “turning off the power in a factory.” Both emphasized that civil discourse and debate among opposing views are essential resources for students to develop, build on and perhaps even challenge their pre-existing beliefs. In that vein, universities have the responsibility to expose their students to a diverse spectrum of ideologies and opinions, as doing otherwise would effectively lull students into thinking in a one-dimensional manner. All this begs the question: Has our university lived up to the promise of engaging its students in ideological diversity? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">A university can be judged by the type of thought and discourse it attracts, as this indicates its commitment to challenging commonly held ideas and engaging in frontier-pushing work. Those who are invited to speak, debate and lecture in its halls are representative of that commitment, and we are coming up short here on College Hill.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In 2017, the University invited a long list of speakers to campus — and we should know. Over the past year, the SPEAK coalition — a group of students, professors and student organizations seeking to bring more ideologically diverse speakers to Brown — has collected data on every speaker invited by the institutes and centers listed by the Political Science Department as “bear(ing) on the study of politics.” We chose to analyze the political affiliations of these speakers as a transparent metric of the ideologies welcomed on campus and of the general environment of discourse. Of the 237 speakers who were politically identifiable based on campaign contributions, social media statements and career histories, 94.5 percent leaned left, while a mere 5.5 percent leaned right. In an examination of political contributions by these speakers, 97.4 percent of donations went to Democratic races and political action committees, whereas only 2.6 percent went to Republican ones. Though political affiliation may be an imperfect measure of ideology, the results are so skewed that they can’t help but betray a lack of diversity. The complete results of our findings are available in our 2017 Brown University Speakers Report, with an extended analysis of the data and a detailed methodology on our website. Our mission has been supported by several student organizations and faculty members.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The Herald reported on this last Tuesday, and reached out to administrators for comment. According to the article, Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs Director Edward Steinfeld took issue with our analysis, commenting that Watson’s programming focuses on “public policy issues from an international and comparative perspective.” He claimed that a left-right dichotomy does not apply to these topics. However, in order to mitigate this very problem, we chose not to include international speakers who had never lived in the United States in our data, and collected additional data on whether speakers’ talks had any relevance to American politics. Of those that were relevant, 93.4 percent of speakers still leaned left.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a concrete example of this issue, the Watson Institute will be hosting a talk later today that was originally titled, “The Future of Bipartisanship.” Yet even this event will not be bipartisan — the two planned speakers are 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Lincoln Chafee ’75 and Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez ’83 P’18. (The title of this event has been changed to “A Conversation about Partisanship Today,” but the description of the event still calls it “a discussion on the future of bipartisanship.”)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Brian Clark, director of news and editorial development, also noted in The Herald piece that the left-right dichotomy in our data failed to capture “in totality the richness and complexity of viewpoint diversity at Brown.” This begs the question: If such a wide diversity of viewpoints is brought to campus, why do almost all of the speakers fall on the left side of the spectrum? This isn’t a matter of chance — as we showed in the report, this bias occurred among professors and non-professors alike, as well as those who addressed both American and international topics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">For these reasons, we, the SPEAK coalition, challenge the Brown community to improve. Diversity of thought is crucial to academic and personal development, and is one of the main reasons we’re all here. How can we truly experience diversity of thought when most of our speakers come from the same perspective?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We at SPEAK seek to hold the University to its promise of creating a more ideologically diverse environment for personal growth, self-reflection and discussion. To this end, Brown should invite intellectuals, journalists, policy practitioners and others from across the ideological spectrum who can articulate their worldviews and subject them to respectful campus scrutiny. This would not include spectacle speakers or professional agitators, who offer nothing of intellectual substance and attack marginalized groups on and off campus. We are now working to expand our coalition and receive input from these groups on how to achieve our goal in the most inclusive and productive way possible.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">We are staunch liberals, lifelong conservatives, avowed libertarians, passionate socialists and everything in between; however, we share a common interest in diversity of thought. As an advisory and watchdog group, SPEAK hopes to facilitate civil debate and open-minded discovery for ourselves and our peers, an environment we argue is currently lacking.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The like-mindedness within our university can only be mitigated by welcoming differing voices into our discourse. Otherwise, how can we be sure that, in Simmons’ words, we do not speak “only of unimportant matters”?</span></p>
<p class="p4">Eugénie Boury ’20 is the media relations director of the SPEAK coalition and can be reached at eugenie_boury@brown.edu. Please send responses to this opinion to letters@browndailyherald.com and other op-eds to <span class="s3">opinions@browndailyherald.com.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Israel &#039;21, Rock &#039;19: Guns are not a mental health issue</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the wake of every mass shooting in this country, there are two responses: 1) We need stricter gun control legislation, and 2) we need to improve the mental health of U.S. citizens.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both of these statements are true, but one is far more relevant to the urgent issue of gun violence in America.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Psychiatrists and researchers agree that the link between mental illness and mass shootings is weak, if it’s there at all. There are a lot of statistics to be thrown around here. When accounting for substance abuse, childhood maltreatment and living in adverse environments, researchers found that the mentally ill were actually less likely to be the perpetrators of violence than the general population. If someone were to magically cure the United States of bipolar disorder, clinical depression and schizophrenia — the three mental illnesses with the highest proclivity for violence — violence in the nation would only decrease by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/untangling-gun-violence-from-mental-illness/485906/">4 percent</a>. Only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/fact-check-parkland-gun-violence-mental-illness.html">1 percent</a> of gun homicides are mass shootings committed by people with mental illnesses. And contrary to popular perception, people with mental illnesses are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11585953">14 times more likely</a> to be the victims of violence in the United States than to be the perpetrators of violence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The obvious question is, if these mass murderers aren’t mentally ill, what could possibly motivate them to commit such horrible acts? Whereas an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/fact-check-parkland-gun-violence-mental-illness.html">analysis</a> of 235 mass killings from 1935 to 2014 revealed that less than a quarter of mass killings are committed by people who could be considered mentally ill, people with a history of domestic abuse have committed over <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/11/07/562387350/in-texas-and-beyond-mass-shootings-have-roots-in-domestic-violence">half of mass shootings</a> between 2009 and 2016. The <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/11/07/562387350/in-texas-and-beyond-mass-shootings-have-roots-in-domestic-violence">Sutherland Springs</a> shooter: history of abusing women. The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-las-vegas-shooting-live-updates-at-his-local-starbucks-vegas-shooter-1507060195-htmlstory.html">Las Vegas</a> shooter: history of abusing women. The <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orlando-shooter-domestic-abuse_us_5760536ae4b0e4fe5143f349">Orlando</a> shooter: history of abusing women.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another strong indicator of gun violence is a history of a hateful presence on social media or membership in hate groups. Why are we talking about Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz’s mental health instead of about the swastikas found <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/us/florida-school-shooting/index.html?sr=twCNN022718florida-school-shooting0441PMVODtop">carved into his magazines</a>? Why was the Charleston shooting a “random act of violence” and not an act of terrorism? If Second Amendment advocates want to blame anything but guns in the aftermath of mass shootings, they should be looking at domestic abuse and white supremacy, not mental illness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, the best way to tackle gun violence is with gun control legislation, according to many major studies. Banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, preventing concealed carry on K-12 school grounds, strengthening background checks. These measures are, thankfully, being proposed in many states, but unfortunately they’re not the only policies being seriously considered or put in place.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An example of a policy that misses the point can be found right here in Rhode Island. On Monday, Feb. 26, Gov. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order establishing a statewide “red flag” <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/02/27/rhode-island-red-flag-dangerous-gun-owners/376158002/">policy</a>. The order, part of a larger push for gun control legislation since the Parkland, Florida shooting last month, directs law enforcement to consider what the order calls “red flags” in assessing whether a person is dangerous. According to the text of the order, these <a href="https://lintvwpri.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/18-01-red-flag.pdf">factors</a> “include but are not limited to the following red flags:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> i. Recent acts or threats of violence by the person against self or others, including statements, videos or photographs posted on social media sites;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> ii. A pattern of prior acts or threats of violence by the person against self or others;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> iii. The criminal history of the person, including arrests and convictions for crimes of violence, whether felonies or misdemeanors, and crimes involving domestic violence, stalking or harassment;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> iv. Previous no-contact orders, restraining orders or protective orders issued against the person;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> v. Unlawful or reckless use or brandishing of a firearm; and, </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> vi. Evidence of recent acquisitions of, or ready access to, firearms.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Current, or a history of, mental illness is correctly left off this list. But again, this list is not comprehensive — deciding what constitutes a “red flag” is left to law enforcement agencies and officers, making people with mental illnesses — and, frankly, people of color — vulnerable to discrimination. We should be looking at policies that keep the focus on guns rather than scapegoating people with mental illnesses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Other states have instituted policies that focus on mental health at the expense of effective gun legislation, or are planning to. Florida Gov. Rick Scott has proposed legislation that would ban people with mental illnesses from buying firearms, and he recently signed a law passed under the mantle of protecting our schools from gun violence — a law that includes a <a href="http://fox61.com/2018/03/09/florida-gov-rick-scott-signs-gun-bill/">provision</a> appropriating $69 million for mental health assistance in schools. Again, we absolutely do need more mental health support in our schools and communities, but to finally fund these things because of a local school shooting blatantly blames people with mental illness for the horrific actions of individuals. This increases the stigma around mental illness already perpetuated by the language we use to talk about mass murderers: “psycho” and “sick” and “crazy.” What’s the point of these policies if they won’t actually prevent mass shootings? When trying to end gun violence in the United States, our focus shouldn’t be on mental health — it should be on domestic abuse, white supremacy and gun control.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, the Brown community will be faced with a fundamental choice. Between 12 p.m. Tuesday and 12 p.m. Thursday, we will be able to vote on not only a new set of candidates for the Undergraduate Council of Students and the Undergraduate Finance Board, but also on a ballot referendum to re-examine the use of legacy preference in the admissions process.

Specifically, the referendum will read: “Should Brown University disclose all internally written admissions policies and disaggregated data about legacy treatment, and charge a joint committee of students, alums and administrators to reexamine the use of legacy status in the admissions process?”

Through conversations with hundreds of students, the #FullDisclosure team and I have found that there is a deep desire for clarity around the University’s use of legacy preference. We’ve met students who both agree and disagree with the use of legacy preference, but virtually every student we’ve talked to concluded that we need to see all the data to have a frank, critical and informed discussion.

But this discussion cannot occur unless we are critical of the University. And we have questions. For example, what is the acceptance rate of legacy applicants compared to the overall student body? How has the share of legacy students changed from year to year? How many legacy students receive financial aid? How many legacy students are eligible for Pell Grants? The appointment of a joint committee will allow a panel of engaged and committed members of the Brown community to re-examine the value that legacy preference brings to the University. By placing a call for transparency and the appointment of a joint committee directly on the ballot, students will be able to show their peers at Brown and nationwide that this is a key issue deserving of our attention.

We want #FullDisclosure.

And we have good reason to call for transparency. Legacy preference finds its roots in discrimination; it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/opinion/end-college-legacy-preferences.html">originally conceived</a> and used to prevent Jewish students from matriculating to elite universities. Secondly, there is no reason to believe that legacy preference brings financial value to the University. A <a href="http://production.tcf.org.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2016/03/08201915/2010-09-15-chapter_5.pdf">study</a> of the top 100 universities in the United States found that the “presence of legacy preference policies does not result in significantly higher alumni giving.” Another <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/the-decline-of-legacy-admissions-at-yale/29338">study</a> looked at seven universities that abandoned legacy preference and found “no short-term measurable reduction in alumni giving as a result of abolishing legacy preferences,” as quoted in The Chronicle of Higher Education. Lastly, the practice is unpopular. A <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/04/14/students-question-use-legacy-admission/">Herald poll</a> conducted in 2014 found that over half of students disagreed with the use of legacy preference, and a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/07/08/poll-finds-public-opposition-considering-race-and-ethnicity-college-admissions">national poll</a> conducted by Gallup found that 52 percent of people disagree with the use of legacy preference.

That being said, these points don’t make a case for abolishing legacy preference outright. But any policy that is historically prejudiced, that hasn’t been shown to bring universities money and that is unpopular deserves a second look.

And truly, re-examination and transparency are what this campaign is about. This is not an attack on individual students’ qualifications. This is not an attempt to antagonize the administration. This is not about getting rid of legacy preference. This campaign is a movement aiming to spark a conversation about educational opportunity.

The #FullDisclosure team is looking forward to continuing this conversation with the student body and the administration after the results of the referendum. Both grassroots momentum from student activists and support from the administration have been critical in institutionalizing past efforts for fairness in admissions practices, like #NoApologies, the campaign to eliminate application fees for first-generation and low-income college applicants. We fundamentally believe that the future of our community should be determined by a thoughtful exchange of ideas and that we should follow the facts wherever they take us.

But first we need to open the discussion.

Vote Yes on #FullDisclosure.

		<title>Stapleford &#039;21: Against the disability identity center</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">On March 12, 1990, over 60 physically disabled individuals <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/americans-disabilities-act-capitol-crawl-anniversary/">threw themselves</a> out of their wheelchairs, abandoned their crutches and left their walkers behind, dragging themselves up the 78 steps of the capitol building in Washington, D.C., to protest the delay of the long-awaited passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p class="p3">The passage of the ADA set in motion a dramatic transformation of the accessibility of institutions like Brown. It is the reason why I, as a wheelchair user, can attend today. It put into law the idea that individuals with disabilities have as much a right to live, work and take part in their communities, without compromise, as their able-bodied peers. This desire — to be fully integrated into an accessible, inclusive community — is one of the reasons why I was drawn to Brown.</p>
<p class="p3">Upon first reading The Herald’s <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/21/students-propose-disability-identity-center/">Feb. 21 article</a> regarding the proposed creation of a disability-focused student-run center, I was initially excited that my peers were addressing an issue that frequently surfaces in my daily life but remains largely undiscussed. However, upon reflection, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot support the creation of the proposed disability identity and cultural center.</p>
<p class="p3">First, I’d like to make something clear: I cannot speak for anyone other than myself, a physically disabled wheelchair user here at Brown. I cannot speak to the issue of psychological, mental or emotional challenges, which the proposed center focuses heavily on. However, it is my belief that for any disability, emphasizing the creation of a separate space actually exacerbates the social isolation and physical separation that those with disabilities at Brown already struggle to overcome.</p>
<p class="p3">To be sure, my experiences with the administration as a disabled student at Brown have been largely positive. I have found that Student and Employee Accessibility Services has done a wonderful job of helping me and many other students access this campus and have been prompt and thoughtful in resolving any issues I have experienced. But many of my experiences with social inclusivity — or rather the lack thereof — have been startling. This campus still has a long ways to go in meeting the ideals of the ADA, and the proposed disability identity and cultural center, while well-intentioned, is not a step forward on this journey.</p>
<p class="p3">The problem is not that the disabled don’t have a space or a feeling of community. The problem is that the spaces and culture of Brown itself are not living up to what the ADA envisioned: integration and inclusion of the disabled. Before coming to Brown, I never quite understood what it was like to navigate a space like this in a wheelchair. I wish I could explain how it feels to be stuck in the snow in my wheelchair, clearly unable to access the sidewalk, and a dozen students pass me before someone stops to help. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve been invited to attend an event, listen to a speaker or go to a party, only to have to turn the invitation down when I realize I will not be able to access the space.</p>
<p class="p3">The social challenges I face are coupled, inevitably, with the physical challenges of being a wheelchair user. The University has multiple buildings that remain partially or completely inaccessible to me. There are many residential housing complexes in which I can never live or visit a friend. The elevator in my dorm has broken down an average of twice a month since I have lived there, and from the time it breaks down until it is fixed, I cannot go to class, get a meal or do anything, without someone being willing to assist me. When our minority peer counselors hold workshops — which first-years like myself are so encouraged to attend — on racism, sexism, ableism and the like, only the ableism talk was held in a wheelchair-accessible space, an irony I have been quietly disturbed by.</p>
<p class="p3">Many people have been kind and helpful to me in these situations during my time at Brown. But many more have not been, and I point this out not to be accusatory but to express to our community that inclusivity is still just an ideal, not a reality, for the physically disabled on this campus. That is what cements my opposition to the proposed disability center. It is my firm belief that I and my physically disabled peers must remain visible, and have our accommodations remain visible as well, to the wider Brown community if we expect Brown to fully achieve the ideal of inclusivity.</p>
<p class="p3">The only way to break down the social and physical barriers between me and my peers is if they know me, see me and begin to see opportunities to be an ally to me in their spaces. I recognize that most people do not interact with someone in a wheelchair on a daily basis, so sometimes it may seem difficult to know how to help or to even remember to think about being accomodating in the first place. But I firmly believe that the only way people who haven’t had this exposure can develop real consideration for disabled people is to actively try to understand what their own role is in facilitating my inclusion in public, social and academic spaces.</p>
<p class="p3">I don’t want to go to a special building to access my community at Brown, because my community is Brown. I want and deserve to be accommodated in the spaces that everybody else can access and to feel just as much a part of the wider community. The letter of the ADA gives me that right, and the spirit of the ADA means that my peers have a responsibility to share the space with me and help me access it when they can.</p>
<p class="p3">I was also startled to notice that the proposal, as described in The Herald on two separate occasions, primarily focused on psychological or emotional disability and mental illness and mentioned physical disability either briefly or not at all. As disabled students, we are individual actors with distinctive experiences of disability — and without our individual voices being included in the conversation, I am concerned that our wants and needs will be misidentified or left out of the conversation and inaccurately conflated or labeled.</p>
<p class="p3">It is my firm belief that a wider culture of inclusivity must be fostered at Brown before any progress can be made and that the proposed center undermines that effort. Before the ADA was enacted, disabled people were often placed in our “own” spaces — separate, designated places to attend school, develop a sense of community and live “safely” without our needed accommodations causing inconveniences to the wider world. I do not believe this model of addressing the needs of disabled people should be revisited. While I have no problem with the resources the center would provide, I strongly encourage the student group to consider providing them in already existing spaces on campus.</p>
<p class="p3">I stand with those disabled activists who, almost thirty years ago, did the impossible to struggle up the steps of the halls of power in our country. I stand with their belief that access to every space is as much my right as that of an able-bodied person, and that integration, not isolation, is the only dignified and adequate form of accommodation. The de facto physical and social segregation that keeps me from accessing this campus like a typical student is profound and the greatest challenge we need to overcome if we want our community here to be disability inclusive.</p>

		<title>Fritschner &#039;06: Gun violence restraining orders are good</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The actions of America’s students over the past two months aren’t just inspiring — they are everything.</p>
<p class="p2">It is impossible to overstate the importance of local, coordinated action in this moment, and Brown’s students have stepped up. This level of grassroots engagement is what gun reform advocates have needed for many years to make advances on this issue.</p>
<p class="p2">Stopping gun violence is something I work on professionally. My career working in Congress began Dec. 14, 2012, the day of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which colored everything that came afterwards for me. Even as I became a press staffer, I asked for and received exactly one legislative issue. I write, therefore, as the gun violence policy advisor to one of the most active members of Congress on that issue — Congressman Don Beyer D-VA— though I am speaking solely for myself today.</p>
<p class="p2">I want to respond to the piece “Guns are not a mental health issue,” which ran in the Brown Daily Herald last week on gun violence and mental health, by Julia Rock ’19 and Jenna Israel ’21.</p>
<p class="p2">Rock and Israel are exactly right that we need better gun laws. They are right that banning weapons of war and strengthening background checks are key objectives of that effort. Rock and Israel are also right to say that bringing up mental illness is a dodge employed by the National Rifle Association and its allies to avoid meaningful conversations about gun violence prevention. I was treated for clinical depression as an undergraduate at Brown 13 years ago, and consider myself a member of the community which comes under attack whenever people wrongly stigmatize mental illness in the wake of a mass shooting.</p>
<p class="p2">Instead of continuing to tolerate these diversion tactics, it is essential that we consider real policy solutions. In particular, I want to make the case for a key reform which Gov. Gina Raimondo has sought for Rhode Island in the aftermath of the shooting in Parkland, Florida.</p>
<p class="p2">Gun violence restraining orders, also referred to as extreme risk protection orders in some states, are a mechanism by which law enforcement and families can restrict access to guns for people who present a demonstrated threat to themselves or others. They have been touted by experts as a means to prevent mass shootings, especially ones where there were numerous warning signs like those exhibited before the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.</p>
<p class="p2">The executive order which Raimondo issued in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting endeavored to enact some aspects of GVROs. Though Raimondo can only do so much by executive order, this is a good first step. But to realize the benefits of GVROs, Rhode Island needs the legal and judicial mechanisms which can only be created by the passage of a law in the state legislature. Raimondo called for such a law at the end of her order, and a bill has been introduced by several state representatives. Florida became the sixth state to enact such a law a few weeks ago, and similar measures are nearing passage in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p2">To return to the piece by Rock and Israel, I want to stress that the GVRO is a measure meant to reduce gun violence, not a mechanism to attack people of color or people with mental disorders.</p>
<p class="p2">As enacted in states like Connecticut, such orders may only be carried out after a judge issues a warrant on the basis of a sworn affidavit submitted by law enforcement or family members attesting to a specific, demonstrated threat of violence.</p>
<p class="p2">The fact that an order to remove guns is issued in response to a provable threat, and not merely to suspicions or the symptoms of mental illness, is key.</p>
<p class="p2">The mentally ill are many more times likely to be victims of gun violence than perpetrators, but most gun deaths in the United States are self-inflicted. Evidence shows that GVROs are crucial in protecting the severely mentally ill because they are particularly effective at preventing suicide by allowing families to remove access to guns from people in crisis.</p>
<p class="p2">Additionally, the fact that family members can seek GVROs helps to mitigate the threat that such measures might disproportionately impact people of color as a result of government action. And in fact, because people of color, particularly women, are at significantly elevated risks of being victims of gun violence, effective gun reforms like GVRO laws are valuable measures in protecting members of these communities.</p>
<p class="p2">GVROs are not a substitute for other gun reforms like the Assault Weapons Ban, introduced by fellow Brown alum Congressman David Cicilline ’83, D-R.I., who represents Providence in Congress, or laws requiring universal background checks; they are a complement to them. Cicilline is also a co-sponsor of the bill on which Beyer is a leader: the Gun Violence Restraining Order Act, which would help states adopt and implement GVRO laws. Sen. Jack Reed D-R.I. has pushed for a similar measure in the Senate.</p>
<p class="p2">Gun violence is a complex issue with many causes and no easy solution. There isn’t a single law that will prevent 30,000 deaths a year. But if an individual reform saves even one life it renders an immeasurable benefit. GVROs can save many lives, and several states have already begun the process of adopting these measures<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— most recently, in Florida and California.</p>
<p class="p2">GVROs are a good step forward, and Rhode Island should enact them.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I read The Herald’s April 1 column “Schapiro ’19: Rob Manfred crosses the Rubicon”, and while I don’t love what Rob Manfred is doing to baseball, denouncing the implementation of an international tiebreaker in the minors is not the right battle to choose. There are plenty of problems to solve in baseball, and there are plenty of problems with the proposed solutions to those problems, but this is not the one to fight.</p>
<p class="p2">First, the idea that the rule doesn’t address a problem is wrong — it just doesn’t address the problem you think it does. Starters are throwing fewer and fewer innings, and after seeing the success of teams with strong bullpens, like the 2016 Cleveland Indians and 2017 Colorado Rockies, relievers are more expensive than ever. Keeping extra innings down isn’t about quickening nail biters — it’s about protecting teams from multimillion-dollar injuries. I love seeing Chris Davis take the win over Darnell McDonald as much as any other fan. It’s exciting, but it also puts overtaxed bullpens and the position players who relieve them at risk unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="p2">Second, if your argument is that old-school baseball is better than the changing modern game, international tiebreakers should make you giddy. It may not have the excitement of a game-winning home run, but with four-baggers already at a record high and climbing, do we realistically need more? Instead, what we get with international rules is the resurgence of small ball baseball, a dying art. Rosters full of power bats nowadays are often devoid of players who can lay down a good bunt and force the defense to make mistakes. That’s old-school baseball at its finest. The team that can execute the fundamentals of the game is the team that wins, and we should be rewarding that. In an era where hitter tendencies can be analyzed down to the minutiae, let’s force teams to squeeze in runs and let bullpens try to stop them. That’s just good baseball, and it’s disappearing.</p>
<p class="p2">Lastly, as much as I dislike a lot of what’s happening in baseball analytics, James Schapiro’s statement that “we’ve played this game the same way for well over a century” is laughable. Forty years ago, the five-man rotations we take for granted now were being questioned in the same way that today’s experimental six-man ones are. Defensive shifts were all but unheard of even 10 years ago, and now we see infielders move not only with every batter, but also with every pitch. Can you imagine today’s American League without the designated hitter? Baseball is steeped in tradition, but perhaps its most pervasive tradition is change. Fans never like it, but they always adapt.</p>
<p class="p2">It is clear that Manfred intends to be the commissioner to save baseball from itself. Pace of play has become a major priority in a way it never was in the past, and rules like visit limits demonstrate the ways our current commissioner is far removed from the actual action on the field. I don’t have Manfred’s playing information in front of me, but that rule tells me he has never spent time behind the dish. No catcher would green-light a restriction like that, and its implementation was detrimental to baseball. However, it has now become part of the multifaceted strategy that makes baseball great. This is the thinking man’s game, and the international tiebreaker is now simply another aspect of it.</p>
<p class="p2">There’s no way to know now if we will see pre-placed runners in the Majors soon, or ever. The rule may become one of those minor league quirks like the pitch clock that is regularly discussed but has so far stayed out of Major League Baseball. Either way, the idea that it somehow takes away from baseball is one I can’t agree with. In an age where we see over 6,000 home runs and double-digit Tommy John surgeries a year, maybe a little more small ball is exactly what we need.</p>

		<title>Bohman &#039;18: Heavy petting should consider dogs’ needs too</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I have hesitated a long time to write this column. I know this issue could make me a pariah on campus, but, as a senior, I guess it’s time to go out with a bang. I have a confession to make: I hate Heavy Petting. I think it’s dangerous. Here’s why.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I am a dog trainer and dog sport competitor, and Heavy Petting runs counter to everything I know about dogs. My dog is a certified therapy dog, and as the handler, I was always taught to put his needs first. If he’s not having fun or enjoying the experience, we leave. I left Heavy Petting and never went back because it was too overwhelming for him because there were dogs running off leash and large dogs and small dogs all crammed together. This is not an environment many dogs feel comfortable or able to concentrate in. It’s true that some dogs enjoy going to the dog park, but they generally don’t go there to be patted by college students. Even when my dog and I compete in dog sport competitions, where there are 35 dogs in a small space, competitors are required to keep our dogs crated and bring them out only for their run.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Heavy Petting also presents a safety issue. A dog surrounded by a million canines and people is probably a stressed-out dog. Based on my previous experiences attending Heavy Petting and talking to University administrators, I was led to believe that BWell Health Promotion, which runs Heavy Petting, has not, in the past, tested dogs for temperament or suitability before the event. Until recently, BWell didn’t even require that the dogs be on a leash or provide supervision for the event. I am frankly unsure of how Heavy Petting has continued under the aegis of the University’s lawyers, who may have reason to be skeptical of dog events. Given the way Heavy Petting is run, I believe it is just a matter of time before there is a dog fight or someone gets hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I want to acknowledge that I do run the other dog therapy club, Brown Animal Assisted Therapy, on campus, which was founded with the idea of providing a different type service from Heavy Petting through individual appointments. However, we would be happy to see a thriving Heavy Petting program on campus — trust me, there’s enough demand.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And there are ways that BWell could run Heavy Petting more safely. There are groups of registered therapy dogs in Rhode Island who only do events like this — I have been contacted by several. If they wanted to stick with faculty members’ dogs, they could have a dog trainer evaluate the dogs for suitability: Every dog could get a certificate before coming to Heavy Petting. They could have separate areas for large and small dogs. They could implement crowd control measures for participants. They could invest in moveable fences so that each dog could have its own space. But many of these measures would require a significant expenditure of effort by the University, which is why I believe they have not happened yet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ultimately, I would like to add that I did not make this public statement without first privately speaking to many members of both the administration and BWell. I am open to hearing that changes are being made that I perhaps have not been informed of, but from my perspective, nothing has changed in the three years I have been here. As Brown students, we should demand better — not only for dogs, but for ourselves. Heavy petting is a fun event, but it can be fun and safe at the same time.</span></p>

		<title>Froid &#039;21: Inviting Jeb Bush to speak is irresponsible</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It was announced recently that the University intends to have former Florida Governor Jeb Bush come to campus to deliver the Stephen A. Ogden Jr. ’60 Memorial Lecture on International Affairs. This decision is disappointing, to say the least. The stated goal of the lecture is, according to the lecture’s <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/04/bush">website</a>, “the advancement of international peace and understanding.” Unfortunately, Bush’s views are not those of peace and understanding. Instead, he represents the exact divides in our world that lead to international conflict.</p>
<p class="p2">Jeb Bush has consistently chosen to advocate for policies that do not, and should not, represent the values of Brown students. Bush has vocally opposed allowing non-straight marriage, as well as the adoption of children by non-straight couples. These are morally unjustifiable positions. Furthermore, Bush has consistently advocated that women be denied their right to access reproductive health care, including abortions. These positions dehumanize, shame and disrespect members of the Brown community and the population at large. Individuals of moral character do not hold these indefensible positions.</p>
<p class="p2">By inviting Bush to deliver a prestigious lecture, the University implicitly suggests that holding morally unjustifiable and outrageous views about women and members of the LGBTQ+ community is not disqualifying of distinction, when in fact it should be. Providing Bush a platform suggests that his views, including his bigotry, deserve the same attention as rational and tolerant views. This should not be the case. It is downright insulting to the members of the Brown community who Bush has dehumanized that he be given the honor of delivering The Stephen A. Ogden Jr. ‘60 Memorial Lecture on International Affairs.</p>
<p class="p2">Even if one were to ignore Bush’s outrageous views, there is simply no reason to believe he has credible opinions on policy. Not only does Bush hold abhorrent views on social matters, but he has also refused to accept the facts surrounding climate change. Bush, in a 2011 interview, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/121580/jeb-bush-talks-about-climate-change-and-carbon-new-hampshire.">misleadingly stated</a>: “It is not unanimous among scientists that (climate change) is disproportionately manmade.” (While it is true that not every single climate scientist has thrown their weight behind this fact, the vast majority have.) Climate change is a serious matter, and the livelihoods of future generations depend on our ability to recognize and combat the serious harms being done to our planet. Someone who will mislead the public about the facts surrounding the climate, for example, should not be treated as a credible source of information on other subjects either. Despite these issues with his credibility, the University believes he is fit to deliver a prestigious lecture.</p>
<p class="p2">Furthermore, given that the topic of the lecture that Bush has been invited to deliver is international affairs, it might seem reasonable to believe that Bush has at least has some relevant experiences in this field. Unfortunately, Bush fails again. For instance, in 2015, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/15/jeb-bush-iraq-war-ivy-zietrich-isis-george-w-bush">stated</a> that, if he had been president in 2003, he would have authorized the invasion of Iraq given the information available. In light of the developments of the past decade, this position seems unthinkable. Bush’s policy positions notwithstanding, his qualifications in the field of international affairs are modest at best. Bush has never held a federal diplomatic office, and though he has engaged in some foreign diplomacy as Governor of Florida, it is unclear what warrants awarding him a prestigious lecture in this field.</p>
<p class="p2">And, let it be clear that the opposition to Jeb Bush speaking on Brown’s campus does not come from some desire to end freedom of speech. Bush certainly has every right to state his own views, and Brown has every right to invite him to speak. However, freedom of speech does not guarantee any platform from which to speak. Nor does freedom of speech mean that we, as a community, must blindly accept the legitimacy of any views presented to us. Furthermore, the opposition to Bush speaking on Brown’s campus does not come out of fear of ideological diversity. Brown ought to welcome those with dissenting views on policy issues. However, Bush’s views are unjustifiable, dehumanizing and rooted in ignorance, and the Brown community should not lend them legitimacy by inviting him to speak. There is a meaningful difference, for example, between legitimately believing that the free market is the best mechanism to confront climate change and denying the basic facts surrounding climate change. One of these positions is a legitimate, if controversial, policy opinion. One is not.</p>
<p class="p2">If Brown wants to encourage debate and discussion on campus, I, by all means, encourage them to find a speaker whose views might challenge those of students. However, when we allow speakers that dehumanize others to find a platform on our campus, we only act to silence those who have been dehumanized. I will gladly listen to any speaker who wants to make a case for a foreign policy doctrine with which I do not agree. What I will not do, however, is listen to someone who fails to recognize the humanity of my family, friends and peers. I strongly encourage the University administration to reconsider their decision to invite Jeb Bush to speak on campus. Furthermore, I strongly encourage them to invite a different speaker, one who has earned the privilege of addressing Brown students, and who represents the values that the University claims to support.</p>

		<title>Sweeney ’19.5: Why we must respect Jeb Bush’s right to speak</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Jeb Bush should be allowed to speak at Brown. In his Apr. 9 op-ed in The Herald, Mark Liang ’19 offered many good points for why this should be the case. But his arguments about why Bush should be allowed to speak endanger liberal democracy by encouraging tribalism and exacerbating political polarization. Further, his proposed solution of personally shaming Bush with protest signs that say “PLEASE CLAP” is atrocious. We can and must aim instead for mutual respect in our political discourse.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Firstly, the main issue with Liang’s perspective is that it condescends to the political right in a tribalist manner, and in doing so violates the concept of mutual respect that is required of a multiparty liberal democracy. He says, “we have to recognize that (Republicans) are there and learn how to beat them.” This is objectionable in that he views political debate as a struggle between two factions where winning is of the utmost importance. His column suggests that liberals should always win. The better argument is that the discourse between liberals and conservatives, and everyone in between, should help to shine light on the truth and on our shared morality as human beings. Political debate should not be about winning, but about truth and justice, and absolutely requires the humility to accept that your ideas could be wrong. Liang shows no willingness to concede that he, in fact, could be wrong in his viewpoints and in his deeply held moral convictions, nor does he consider that humility and mutual respect are the reasons why Bush should be allowed to present his views at Brown. We cannot move on from political polarization until we, the next generation of American leaders, put justice before party and show respect for the ideas of others.</span></p>
<p class="p2">What’s more, it is widely accepted that Bush is, especially by today’s standards, a moderate Republican. He does not spew radical nonsense and conspiracy theories — instead he is informed, articulate and justifies his viewpoints with intellectual principles. Because Bush has shown respect for all those he engages with in political debate (even when President Trump attacked him in the Republican primaries in 2016), he deserves to be treated respectfully. It is for these reasons, as well as the simple fact that he is a human being and therefore deserves respect, that it is morally abhorrent to propose, as Liang does, that students should protest Bush with signs saying “PLEASE CLAP” — a reference to a vulnerable moment in which Bush asked the audience to clap during a stump speech for his presidential bid in 2016. To even suggest that it is morally tolerable to protest someone by invoking one of their most personally vulnerable moments — one which itself has minimal relation to politics — is unfathomable. To berate Bush with this type of ad hominem attack is to become a bully in the same manner that Trump has been, by using schoolyard taunts in place of reasoned and respectful debate. It is precisely this kind of backhanded comment, a personal attack in place of a political one, that threatens to increase political polarization. Liberal democracy is premised on mutual respect, which is undermined when we reduce our discourse to mere tribalism.</p>
<p class="p2">Although one should have respect for those willing to engage in genuine debate on political issues, there is some speech that is unequivocally beyond the pale. When hate speech is invoked in political debate, for instance, we should not legitimate it by inviting its advocates to campus. Yet at the same time, we should also not respond with personal attacks and taunts. To be clear, Bush does not meet the bar for hate speech and should be permitted to come to campus and respected when he arrives. But the health of our liberal democracy depends on the quality of our discourse, and even when we come across people with hateful views, it is important that we are able to marginalize those views through civil discussion rather than resorting to toxic discourse ourselves.</p>
<p class="p2">Some people would surely say that Bush’s viewpoints are immoral and therefore the type of protest advocated for by Liang is justified. To them I say, we must always treat others with respect in our political discourse: It does not depend on what others say or do. Personally shaming Bush is a morally bankrupt idea and ought not to be tolerated by Brown students or by the Brown administration.</p>

		<title>Buchsbaum &#039;19: Disrupting the path to sexual assault perpetration</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2015, Kevin Swartout, an associate professor of psychology at Georgia State University, seemingly confirmed long-held doubts about the demographics of perpetrators of sexual assault when he published his article, “Trajectory Analysis of the Campus Serial Rapist Assumption.” Swartout dismantled clinical psychologist David Lisak’s 2002 study — “Repeat Rape and Multiple Offending Among Undetected Rapists” — which described assaulters as serial predators, “monsters” lurking among us. Lisak’s study stirred up a storm and influenced sexual assault prevention education for the better part of a decade, but further research on the same issue has identified different results.
<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In opposition to previous thought, Swartout’s study indicated that college-aged men who perpetrate assault tend to do so only once or twice, and often unknowingly. Moreover, he found that there was a temporally-linked switch: men who had assaulted prior to college often did not continue, and men who had not assaulted prior to college only began after they entered a new social sphere. Swartout sees a crucial environment shift: if men exit an environment tolerant of abuse of women and enter one that repudiates this behavior, they become less likely to offend. Unfortunately, the reverse holds true as well.</span></p>
<p class="p2">So, which is it? Are offenders serial perpetrators? Or are they oblivious individuals who don’t consider the harm they are doing to others? The answer is likely somewhere along a spectrum. Research has established that perpetrators justify their actions through assumptions about entitlement, power and privilege. What we need now is research on how to unlearn those assumptions and how those assumptions create the “monsters” of Lisak’s research.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Before New York Times reporters Meghan Twohey and Jodi Kantor broke their investigative story on Harvey Weinstein’s years of systematic abuse and assault of women in the film industry, I was inclined to believe that most assaults — in college, at least — fell into the category Swartout delineated: men who did not understand the totality of consent and who, often unknowingly, violated their partners. I was inclined to believe that serial perpetration was a myth. Perhaps that was my own naivety at hand, perhaps it was my own blinding desire to trust in the good of people. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Nonetheless, the Harvey Weinsteins, Matt Lauers and President Donald Trumps of the world clearly exist — men in roles of immense power abusing that power to coerce and hurt women, in a sick exercise of social and physical force over another’s body. But so too exist the Aziz Ansaris of the world — men who publicly commit to navigating the pitfalls of relationship dynamics and advocating for feminist causes, who nonetheless exercise their power coercively over another person’s body. A difference exists — many men, including Weinstein, consciously benefit from office cultures that silence conversations around sexual assault — but where does that lead? Is Ansari’s obtuseness and dismissal of Grace’s needs a solemn harbinger of what may ensue should no one illuminate to him how he caused harm?</p>
<p class="p2">I’m inclined to believe there may be a breaking point — a point of no return, so to speak — where after a given number of weird nights, uncomfortable extrications of bodies from beds, “C’mon, it’ll be fun”s, the Azizes of the world can morph into something darker. Someone who doesn’t know how to satisfy that desire any other way, someone who even thrives off that exercise of power over another person’s body. But where does that shift occur? On a drunken night after a rager in a basement, upon entering a cutthroat corporate hierarchy or after amassing enough power to silence any whistleblowers? Or is the entitlement to others’ bodies internalized from an early age and simply awakened through too many “I got away with it”s?</p>
<p class="p2">More research must be conducted — not just on college-aged men, though that demographic is an excellent locale in which to implement sexual assault prevention education. We need to think more expansively around the trajectory and hierarchy of these crimes. Weinstein and Lauer did not act in a vacuum — they lived and worked in environments that enabled their gross abuse of others. We need to think beyond college campuses as the source of the “assault issue,” adopt a multi-pronged approach to root out this point of no return and integrate a culture of consent into our daily lives. We need to teach from a young age how consent is not an abnormal entity that appears only at the door to a sexual encounter, but a routine component of regular interactions. And on the other end of the equation, restorative justice can be a mechanism by which colleges and workplaces intervene in problematic and violatory behavior so that perpetrators don’t reach that point of no return. Simultaneously, we need to identify the threshold where unlearning entitled, harmful behavior proves impossible.</p>
<p class="p2">Swartout’s research forwards that one’s environment factors into these transition points, indicating that fostering a culture of consent in all of our institutions — schools, businesses, governments — is crucial to reducing sexual assault. At Brown, we have begun the steps toward this comprehensive approach — the Undergraduate Council of Students requires that categorized student groups have a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/14/ucs-passes-campus-consent-amendment/">trained sexual assault peer educator</a> in their group, and we overhauled our <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/11/advocates-stress-training-address-rape-culture/">sexual assault prevention orientation</a>. But this type of research can provide a framework as we as a society grapple with how we rehabilitate or castigate perpetrators of sexual assault.</p>
<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this op-ed stated that Kevin Swartout seemingly confirmed long-held doubts about the demographics of perpetrators of sexual assault when he published his article, “The company they keep: How men’s social networks influence their sexually aggressive attitudes and behaviors.” In fact, Swartout seemingly confirmed long-held doubts about the demographics of perpetrators of sexual assault when he published his article, "Trajectory Analysis of the Campus Serial Rapist Assumption." An earlier version of this op-ed also stated that further research failed to reproduce the results of David Lisak’s 2002 study — “Repeat Rape and Multiple Offending Among Undetected Rapists." In fact, further issue on the same issue has identified different results. The Herald regrets the errors.</strong></em>

		<title>Israel &#039;21, Rock &#039;19: Rhode Island needs in-person early voting</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 37 states and Washington D.C., voters may cast a ballot in person at some point before election day; in Rhode Island, you cannot. This poses a barrier to accessing the ballot for people with inflexible work schedules, childcare responsibilities, lack of access to transportation and other reasons that might prevent a person from showing up to vote on election day. Hopefully, that will soon change: R.I. Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rhode-island/articles/2018-02-13/secretary-of-state-pushes-for-early-in-person-voting">introduced</a> a bill in this legislative session to allow Rhode Islanders to vote early, in person, as many as 20 days in advance of a primary or general election. The response to this bill has been neatly split along party lines: State GOP Chairman Brandon Bell <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180314/ri-advocates-of-early-in-person-voting-renew-push-for-legislation">told</a> the Providence Journal that he opposed the legislation because it would force voters to make decisions without “important information” which “usually comes to light later in the campaign.” Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo wrote in her testimony in support of the bill: “Our current system needlessly excludes many working Americans who are unable to cast ballots on election day due to inflexible schedules or other conflicts.”</span></p>
<p class="p2">Between 2006 and 2012, in-person early voting programs were expanded across the country, which allowed researchers to study the impacts of the legislation. The percentage of voters who cast their ballots in person grew in each election throughout that time frame. Some of the best-studied outcomes of the legislation were that in-person early voting reduced the stress on election officials on election day, which allowed them to carry out their jobs more effectively and led to shorter lines at the polls on election day, according to a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/early-voting-what-works">report</a> published by the Brennan Center for Justice.</p>
<p class="p2">But perhaps most importantly, early voting legislation has proven to enfranchise the populations of voters that have historically been prevented from voting through practices such as poll taxes, voter ID laws, racial gerrymandering and purges to voter rolls. These practices have impeded black and Latino Americans in particular from voting throughout history.</p>
<p class="p2">Early voting has been proven to increase voter turnout between 2 and 4 percent, with a higher increase among minority voters, according to an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/which-voters-show-up-when-states-allow-early-voting">article</a> published by ProPublica in 2016. According to a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/voting-rights/cutting-early-voting-voter-suppression">fact sheet</a> produced by the American Civil Liberties Union, 32 percent of ballots cast in the 2012 election were cast early, either in person or by mail. In 2008 and 2012, 70 percent of black voters in North Carolina voted early. In 2012, black voters in Ohio voted early at twice the rate of white voters.</p>
<p class="p2">In 2008 in Florida, a group of black church congregations organized a “Souls to the Polls” initiative in which they transported their congregations from church the Sunday before election day to vote early at polling sites. That year, black voters made up 13 percent of registered voters, but cast 22 percent of early ballots. In 2012, the Florida legislature passed a law to roll back early voting, but the law was struck down by the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C., because the judges found that the law violated the Voting Rights Act by disproportionately preventing black voters from voting.</p>
<p class="p2">In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder, ruling that the racial discrimination against voters that the Act was passed to prohibit no longer exists. In the wake of that decision, state legislatures across the country, especially those dominated by Republicans, passed laws that reduced access to the ballot in ways that particularly affected these historically disenfranchised voters. The ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/voting-rights/sos-voting-rights-act-need-immediate-repair">reported</a> in 2016 that following the Shelby decision, at least 17 states passed laws that restricted voting. In Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, the early voting periods were cut short, and in Wisconsin early voting on nights and weekends was eliminated, posing an obvious barrier to people with strict work schedules. We hope to reverse that trend here in Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="p2">Today, Brown students will be meeting under Faunce Arch to leave at 3 p.m. to join groups including Common Cause of R.I., the Working Families Party and the NAACP of Providence to participate in a lobby day in support of the early voting bill. Please join the Brown Progressive Action Committee, your peers and activists in Rhode Island to ask legislators to expand voting access in the state. We only live in a democracy so long as people are able to vote.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As a member of the Brown community for the past 11 years, I have come to treasure and expect the diversity of backgrounds and perspectives that we find on our campus. It’s one of the reasons why I came back after taking time off as an undergraduate and why I again came back to Brown as a medical student. One of the most valuable lessons I have learned here is to not assume that I truly, or even partially, understand someone else’s point of view. As the son of two parents who I would describe as liberal in every sense of the word (politically, socially, religiously, etc.) and the product of a community with similar leanings, I didn’t knowingly engage with a self-identified conservative or Republican until the latter half of my time in college. Contrary to my expectations, I found that we shared a great deal of common ground. We loved our families and considered them in almost every personal decision that we made. We saw the chance to pursue higher education as one of the most valuable opportunities in a young person’s life and wanted to find ways to extend this privilege to as many others as possible. And perhaps most importantly, we both wanted to find happiness in our lives and to help others to do the same.</p>
<p class="p2">While I may share many of the political views described by Michael Froid ’21 in his <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/06/froid-21-inviting-jeb-bush-speak-irresponsible/">piece</a>, “Inviting Jeb Bush to speak is irresponsible,” I have a hard time with his reference to “policies that do not, and should not, represent the values of Brown students.” I do not believe that there are politics, positions or perspectives that define our entire student body, nor should there be. In fact, I think that diversity in these areas is what makes our campus, and ultimately our country, unique.</p>
<p class="p2">Much of my growth at Brown as a college student, a soon-to-be physician and a human being has come from having conversations with and being pushed by other students and people who see the world differently from than I do. I have learned to listen to activists explain why they think abortion is unjust and immoral, and I have learned to care for patients even when they express bigotry. Each of these moments was different and uncomfortable in its own way. I have found that these encounters often arise when you least expect them, which makes them that much more difficult and sometimes even painful when they seem to target us directly. At the same time, I am grateful that I’ve gotten to cross paths with these people and that they weren’t denied a place at Brown, in Rhode Island or in the United States because of how they voted or what they thought. I am grateful that each of these people pushed me to consider different perspectives, even when I disagreed with them.</p>
<p class="p2">I speak solely for myself here — I think that as students, we need to be pushed and to be challenged. Some of our most valuable learning comes from times when we are made to feel uncomfortable. I think that finding respect for and common ground with someone who might seem to be our complete opposite is a skill that we all could and should practice. I am grateful that we at Brown have no prerequisites for political leanings or for the values that we hold dear. The freedoms to respectfully share and speak your thoughts are parts of this community that I will always value. I believe that if we try to create a mold into which all Brown students must fit, we will risk losing them.</p>

		<title>BIRC: University should do more to support immigrant communities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On April 5, 2018, the Brown Immigrant Rights Coalition launched a campaign to gather support from students, faculty and community members to encourage the University to critically reflect on the impact of its scholarship and to commit to increasing its support of the immigrant communities within and outside our campus. The decision to launch this campaign was prompted by grievances from Providence community members over a central component in Senior Fellow in International and Public Affairs Stephen Kinzer’s class INTL 1802W: “International Journalism”, in which students were tasked with finding a person who qualifies as a “Dreamer” and with holding them as their object of study for the duration of the semester. We believe that mistakes in the design of this course could have been avoided through a more careful and informed preparation of the course. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We agree with Professor Kinzer that there needs to be more scrutiny of the immigration system of our country today and the way in which it impacts our society, and we agree that one way to go about this is through journalism. We believe responsible journalism and scholarship should be performed with a high degree of integrity and sensitivity — especially when it directly affects the most vulnerable members of our community. We are working privately with Professor Kinzer and the students in the course to ensure that this is a productive learning experience for all. We would like to work with the broader Brown community, however, to be better informed and proactive on this issue at a truly critical point in our national history. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our call to action speaks to a larger need for reform. At a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is steeply on the rise and when immigrant communities are often pointed to as scapegoats for the problems of the world today, it is more important now than ever for us to get informed and involved. We have composed a list of demands that we believe will promote and deepen the necessary dialogue on immigration that we need to be having on this campus, dialogue which will work to raise our humane and intellectual comprehension of the world. In working to meet these goals, Brown would be upholding its own values on progressing toward diversity and inclusion, and would be helping to lead the way in our nation’s understanding and discourse.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our demands are as follows:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>1. Comprehensive training for faculty and student leaders on working with undocumented people</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In order for Brown to be a campus that engages in responsible and ethical research regarding migration, and, as such, to be a campus that is hospitable to undocumented students and students from mixed-status backgrounds, we believe that it is paramount for our professors and student leaders to be well-informed about our country’s immigration laws and the increasingly multitudinous legal and social threats and obstacles that undocumented people face in the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Understanding that there are multiple undocumented students on campus and many more who come from mixed-status families, we believe campus awareness can and must grow to be cognizant of the challenges undocumented people face, so future academic work and community building on campus are sensitive to this issue and do not work to perpetuate harm against these communities.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>2. An expansion of “Pathways to Diversity and Inclusion: An Action Plan for Brown University” to explicitly consider working with undocumented students and undocumented people</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While Brown has been making strides in progressing toward its established goal of becoming a more diverse and inclusive campus, we urge the institution not to leave undocumented communities behind. The current DIAP states undocumented students, among other groups, are a focus in recruiting and supporting on this campus. But we believe that for Brown to be earnest in this effort, the plans which each academic and administrative department have to create must take into consideration how to best work with and support undocumented people. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>3. The hiring of more faculty with true expertise on the topic of migration and immigration</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If Brown is to be a leader in understanding migration, its research and scholarship produced on this topic must be impassioned and cutting-edge, and must not be parochial. Recruiting more faculty with expertise will allow for our campus understanding to develop and grow.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>4. A strong recommitment to actively recruiting and admitting undocumented students and students with Temporary Protected Status, Deferred Enforced Departure or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">College access has long been and continues to be littered with systemic obstacles and barriers for undocumented students. Recognizing this, Brown has committed to making its admissions open and equitable to these students. We ask that Brown hold itself accountable to bringing in top undocumented students from around the country for the betterment of our campus community and campus awareness.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>5. Expanding Brown’s Tam Tran memorial by creating the Tam Tran Undocumented Series and providing funds to support the Tam Tran Scholarship </i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Tam Tran was an undocumented doctoral student at Brown who was killed in a motor accident in 2010. She was passionate about advocating for immigrant rights and immigration reform, and used filmmaking as a medium to uplift the narratives of undocumented students. In honoring her life work, BIRC helped start the Tam Tran Scholarship to provide financial assistance for undocumented students in Rhode Island seeking to attend college. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Recipients of this award have asked us why Brown students keep pestering them for interviews. We do not believe this is doing right by the legacy of Tam Tran. We ask Brown to stop this practice and to focus instead on resources and attention toward programming and scholarship that honors the enduring vision of Tam Tran.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><em>John Lopez ’18.5,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maria Camila Arbelaez Solano ’19, Alexis Roman ’21, Angel Mendez ’20, Kathleen Wu ’20 and Javier Juarez GS are members of the Brown Immigrant Rights Coalition and can be reached at john_lopez-aldas@brown.edu, maria_arbelaez@brown.edu, alexis_roman@brown.edu, angel_mendez-flores@brown.edu, kathleen_wu@brown.edu and javier_juarez@brown.edu, respectively.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Earlier this week, a group called Students Supporting Israel — which has no affiliation with Brown Students for Israel or, as far as we know, with any student group on campus — tabled outside of the Stephen Robert ’62 Campus Center last Wednesday. We, as leaders of Brown Students for Israel, approached the tablers and urged them to leave. We took great issue with a number of this group’s tactics, which we found to be both counterproductive and embarrassing to the pro-Israel community. Our intention in this op-ed is both to clarify that we have no relationship with SSI and to explain some of the reasons why we found SSI’s actions this week problematic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First, it is important that we establish the facts about Wednesday’s incident. Despite the similar acronyms of SSI and BSI — Students Supporting Israel and Brown Students for Israel, respectively — the two groups are in no way related. SSI acted independently, without reaching out to BSI, and arrived on campus without our knowledge. BSI members learned of their presence at the same time as the rest of the Brown community. SSI exhibited posters that distilled very complex topics in the conversation about Palestine and Israel into simplistic slogans, and they sought to incite Brown students to anger so that they could film us for their “research.” BSI leaders were among the students whom they tried to videotape. In doing so, SSI deeply upset a number of Brown students who have, as many members of BSI do, a personal connection to the conflict between Israel and its neighbors. When BSI learned of SSI’s activities, we asked the group a number of times to leave. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From our perspective, one enormous issue with SSI’s actions on our campus this week was the group’s apparent decision not to consult with members of the Brown community before visiting. As much as outside and national groups can, and regularly do, participate in the conversation about Israel and Palestine on Brown’s campus, such groups ought to do so with the permission and facilitation of Brown students or members of the faculty. These SSI representatives lacked an understanding of Brown’s student body. They did not know how to engage with intellectually curious, justice-focused students, and they were neither prepared for nor, apparently, interested in, serious, nuanced discussions about Israeli and Palestinian history, politics, policy and current events. BSI has worked hard in the past to keep away from campus those groups, no matter their opinion on Israel, that we know will not contribute constructively to the Israel-Palestine conversation at Brown. We care deeply about the needs of students affected by the conflict on this campus, and so prioritize a productive, civil campus discourse — we are dubious that this SSI delegation shared this priority.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">BSI disagrees heavily with SSI on issues of tactics. We believe that conversations about Palestine and Israel, especially on a college campus, must be informed and thoughtful, and that they must start from a place of mutual respect among people with different perspectives and experiences. When we host events and engage in conversations, we do so with the aim of both educating ourselves and our fellow students, on the one hand, and promoting dialogue, justice and peace, on the other. In particular, it is very important to us to never generalize about Palestinians, Muslims, Arabs or any other national, ethnic, religious or racial group. As we see it, SSI aimed less to cultivate a nuanced discussion than to generate content for their video last Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, we are concerned that SSI’s provocative language has the potential to excuse attacks on Zionist or Jewish students more broadly. Over the years, Jewish students, including BSI members, have been bullied, harassed, silenced, slandered and subjected to anti-Semitism and even to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/21/anti-semitic-homophobic-vandalism-found-in-marcy-house/">threats of violence</a> on College Hill. We also worry that Israel-Palestine discourse on campus tends to become uncivil. In recent years, we’ve heard anti-Zionist students express the view that incivility on their part is excusable on the grounds that there exists a power imbalance between Israel and Palestine. However, those claims do not adequately account for both the broader regional and historical context of the conflict between Israel and its neighbors and a host of other (often existential) threats and fail to recognize the very real losses that Zionist students have experienced on this campus — some of us have lost friends and relatives to the conflict, and most of us have family in the line of the fire.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For our part, BSI members commit to working hard to promote a high standard of respectful discourse. We seek a solution that accommodates the needs of both Israelis and Palestinians. When we see members of the pro-Israel community, even those who are not Brown students and with whom we are not affiliated, behaving in ways that do not meet that standard, we are, frankly, embarrassed, and we worry that it undermines our requests for civil treatment by anti-Zionists.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That is why the leaders of Brown Students for Israel would like to extend a formal invitation to any member of the Brown community interested in serious discussion about Palestine, Israel or other issues related to Southwest Asia or Zionist or Jewish peoplehood to reach out to us. If you would like to further this conversation, we invite you to contact us. The setting for nuanced and intellectually rigorous conversations is not at the intersection of Brown St. and Waterman. Whether you are interested in Zionist organizing or are grappling with the issues, whether you are curious to learn more about Israel and the conflict or would like to share your critiques of Israel and Israeli policy, we want to engage with you.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many Brown students assume that Rhode Island’s status as a blue state — and its reputation for progressivism on the national stage — means that we live in a safe haven of reproductive rights. But in fact, NARAL Pro-Choice America ranks reproductive rights access here as <a href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/state/rhode-island/">“severely restricted,”</a> its lowest grade, on par with states such as Alabama and Texas. In short, the condition of reproductive health care access in Rhode Island is unacceptable, and Brown students must work harder to support protections for reproductive rights in the state.</span></p>
<p class="p2">In January 1973, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that abortion is a fundamental right under the U.S. Constitution. Even though this landmark decision nullified abortion bans across the country, many states like Rhode Island did not amend state laws on this issue. Forty-five years later, the ban is still on the books at the state level in Rhode Island — and if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned, as President Trump has promised to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/live-updates/trump-white-house/neil-gorsuch-confirmation-hearings-updates-and-analysis-on-the-supreme-court-nominee/trump-promised-judges-who-would-overturn-roe-v-wade/?utm_term=.95386d65df24">encourage,</a> abortion would once again be illegal.</p>
<p class="p2">Even though abortion is currently legal because of Roe v. Wade, Rhode Island law burdens patients seeking reproductive health care with draconian restrictions. A doctor must notify a married woman’s husband, for example, before performing an abortion. Women under 18 must obtain parental consent for an abortion procedure, even in the cases of rape, incest or child abuse. Low-income women on Medicare are not able to obtain health insurance to cover an abortion procedure. And bans on late-term abortion do not provide an explicit exception to protect the health of the woman. These restrictions are in part why Rhode Island has earned such a low rating from NARAL on reproductive health access.</p>
<p class="p2">For many years, progressive representatives in the Rhode Island House and Senate have tried to codify the protections of Roe v. Wade in state law through the passage of the Reproductive Health Care Act. This bill would ensure that current federal protections are guaranteed under state law and would repeal unenforceable measures such as the requirement for spousal notice. But the leadership of the State House, which consists mainly of anti-choice <a href="http://www.wpri.com/news/eyewitness-news-investigates/pro-life-group-backs-top-ri-dems-for-re-election/1044214513">Democrats,</a> perennially stalls the <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/807512">bill’s progress.</a> Every year when the bill is introduced, it flounders in committee and never makes it to the floor for <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/15/r-lawmakers-reintroduce-law-protect-abortion-rights/">a vote.</a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Rhode Island falls short when it comes to other reproductive rights issues as well. Tampons, for example, are still considered non-essential goods under Rhode Island law, and are therefore subject to sales tax. State Rep. Edith Ajello, D-Providence, who is sponsoring a new bill to eliminate tax for these products, said in a committee hearing last June that the<a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170601/ri-women-tell-lawmakers-its-time-to-abolish-tampon-tax"> tax is unfair.</a> Tampons are necessary “for women’s physical health and safety,” she said, and the tax is particularly a burden for low-income women.</span></p>
<p class="p2">There is some hope, however, that the political status quo regarding reproductive health in Rhode Island is shifting. It is encouraging to see several pro-choice women and men, such as Rebecca Kislak ’94, running for the State House this election cycle. But as of now, the <a href="http://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/ri-lawmakers-attempt-to-end-tampon-tax/1044220166">tampon tax bill</a> and the <a href="https://upriseri.com/news/health-care/reproductive-rights/2018-04-11-rhca-house/">Reproductive Health Care Act</a>, once again, are stuck in committee. To that end, Brown NARAL has organized phone banks and canvassing efforts, in addition to extending invitations to pro-choice State House candidates to come to campus. Brown NARAL and the Brown chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union are also co-sponsoring a discussion with Wendy Davis, the former Texas state senator who gained national attention after her 11-hour filibuster to delay the passage of abortion restrictions in 2013. We hope the event will serve as a reminder of the importance of robust reproductive health care legislation, and of the dire state of reproductive rights in Rhode Island and nationwide.</p>
<p class="p2">We urge our peers to attend and take part in the discussion. But more importantly, it is imperative for Brown students to campaign for reproductive rights progress in Rhode Island, especially in the face of a regressive federal administration. That means supporting pro-choice candidates in November, specifically candidates for the Rhode Island State House and Senate who will support bills such as the Reproductive Health Care Act. It also means educating people on campus and beyond about the appalling environment of reproductive health care restrictions in the state. This is especially critical as federal protections for abortion are the most at risk in the 45 years since Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p class="p2">Please join us on April 21 at 4 p.m. in Metcalf Auditorium to welcome Davis, and in the larger fight for reproductive justice as we mobilize for the November state elections.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Political engagement has skyrocketed since the 2016 election. Mass rallies are increasingly frequent, more non-politician candidates are running for local office and research indexes of political engagement have shot upwards. But in a time when hours on our phones are spent complaining on Facebook to garner “likes” instead of speaking with our representatives, we have to ask ourselves about the quality, not quantity, of our political engagement. Are we involved in politics to serve our communities, or are we only motivated by our resumes? Do we follow through on the political work that we sporadically begin? Do we practice all that we preach in our self-righteous social media rants and our grand professions of social values?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It seems that our generation thinks showing up for a rally armed with some friends, a witty sign and a cute Instagram post with the insert-relevant-hashtag-here counts as effective activism. Yes, rallies are important, and showing solidarity is always meaningful. Town square gatherings to debate and protest are one of America’s earliest forms of democratic engagement. Rallies like the DACA protection rally at the Rhode Island State House last year are powerful demonstrations to members of our community that they are supported and that their voices are heard.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But rallies require follow-through. If we want real policy change — the change we rant about on social media — we have to keep showing up. It is not enough to stand at one march, congratulate ourselves for participating and then go home. Rallies are insufficient in producing substantial policy change when they are not followed up with phone banks, canvasses, lobby days, email campaigns and, especially, votes. If we want change, we need action items, plural.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We observed the pitfalls of a lack of follow-through in the aftermath of the 2017 Women’s March: Unprecedented turnout and energy were converted to little (if any) legislative action. The March was a historic demonstration which motivated many women to run for office and reinvigorated the political consciousness of many young people nationwide. The turnout at the March made an important statement about the values of modern Americans and renewed many people’s hope in a future that respects the rights of women, people of color, Muslims, immigrants, refugees, LGBTQ+ individuals and the Earth. But the Women’s March had no clear policy goals, no concrete or actionable “next steps.” We know what we marched for, but what did we march toward? I use the Women’s March as an example, but this is a pattern we observe each time we rally. Can you think of any concrete national legislative changes that are directly attributable to a recent march?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is easy to respond that obdurate legislators, not marchers, are at fault. But the recent teacher strike in West Virginia challenges this narrative. Teachers had specific demands, and they took collective, organized and (most importantly) sustained action to achieve them. Rather than standing in front of the West Virginia State Capitol for a few hours chanting catchy slogans, teachers took strong, intentional action that left the state no choice but to work with them on their demands. And ultimately, they were successful. This is how effective change happens: following up a clear message with decisive, unrelenting action to produce results.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">For examples of effective activism, we need only to look to our peers. There are so many students at Brown who put in innumerable thankless hours each week, collecting signatures, lobbying senators and knocking on doors. Look at Gabe Zimmerman ’18 and <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/27/students-lobby-housing-legislation/">Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere</a>, for example. Their tireless, humble and rarely recognized work was directly influential in reinstating No-Fare RIPTA passes last year for individuals experiencing homelessness. The March for Our Lives has also shown us that students can be impactful: In the wake of the Parkland shooting, praises abound for youth leadership, and politicians and the media alike are heralding a new era of youth-led activism. The problem is, millennials consistently have the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html">lowest voter turnout</a> of any age group in America, despite being the nation’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/politics/brownstein-millennials-largest-voter-group-baby-boomers/index.html">largest voting-eligible age group</a> as of 2017. We have more power than ever before, but by not sustaining our political engagement (even enough to vote!), we waste it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The moral of the story is, talking and caring about politics isn’t going to cut it. Meaningful action means more than sharing articles on Facebook. Change requires getting your hands dirty. It requires knocking on doors, making calls, going to community organizing meetings and showing up at the State House. Sporadic “feel-good” activism might earn you social capital or a resume boost, but it is not going to solve the tremendous challenges we face. While you remain comfortable in the Brown bubble, climate change continues to worsen, Americans continue to go unhoused or uninsured, immigrants continue to face deportation and prisons continue to swell. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So please, come to rallies. Show up for marches. But then go home and call your senator, your reps, your mayor’s office. Canvass for an issue or a candidate. Lobby at the State House. Vote in primaries and midterms. Join a local activism organization. If you hold a community rally, identify some feasible but powerful actions that you can point people toward. If you want change, your Instagram post is not enough. If you want to help people in your community, patting yourself on the back is not enough. We’ve got a long road ahead, and we have to sustain our energy to fight for the change we need.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> The Brown Progressive Action Committee’s motto goes: “Don’t agonize, organize.” Just remember not to self-aggrandize.</span></p>
<p class="p5">If you want to take political action or learn about events and local activism opportunities, consider following the Brown Progressive Action Committee page on Facebook or reach out to bpac@brown.edu to be added to the listserv. While BPAC is progressive and run by Brown students, it is also non-partisan and available as a resource for everyone. Virginia Schilder ’20 is chair of the Brown Progressive Action Committee and can be reached at virginia_schilder@brown.edu.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reproductive rights, as usual, are <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/15/abortion-trump-supreme-court-roe-wade-473601">under attack</a>. Conservative activists have intensified their efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade and strip away access to abortion through legislation at the state level, both in Rhode Island and across the rest of the nation. The threat to reproductive freedom has not been in danger like this, especially on a national scale, in a long time. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is no secret that President Trump and his administration are hostile to reproductive rights. In April 2017, Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trump-addresses-45th-march-life/">signed legislation</a> that overturned an Obama administration rule that prohibited states from defunding abortion service providers. In January 2018, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/01/19/578928911/trump-unlikely-champion-of-anti-abortion-rights-movement-to-address-march-for-li">Trump spoke</a> at the 45th Annual March for Life rally, an anti-abortion rally that seeks to overturn Roe v. Wade. At the rally, he stated, “Under my administration, we will always defend the very first right in the Declaration of Independence, and that is the right to life.” It is abundantly clear that Trump is not an advocate or defender of the right to choose. Additionally, Vice President Mike Pence <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/376793-the-end-of-abortion-in-your-dreams-mike-pence">has stated</a> that he predicts abortion will “end in our time” and that he would like to see Roe v. Wade in the “ash heap of history.” The threats the Trump administration is making against the right to choose are incredibly alarming. Many have written these threats off as typical Republican rhetoric but it is not politics as usual this time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The risk is greater now than in previous years because Trump is one Supreme Court Justice away from overturning Roe v. Wade. <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/377555-gop-senator-justice-kennedy-is-going-to-retire-this-summer">Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, said</a> that he believes Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has traditionally served as the Court’s “swing vote,” will announce his retirement this summer. This is incredibly troubling because it would provide the Trump administration another opportunity to nominate a conservative, pro-life replacement. Needless to say, there would be significant ramifications for those who rely on access to reproductive health care services, including abortion. This move would define the court for generations, likely stalling any social progress that has been made on many civil, social justice and reproductive health care issues. Low-income communities and black and brown people in particular will be disproportionately affected by the change. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Roe v. Wade is overturned, states could easily impose restrictions that would limit or totally eliminate a woman’s access to abortion services. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet, even without overturning Roe v. Wade, conservatives are intensifying their efforts to restrict access to abortion on a state level. Mississippi recently passed a restrictive abortion ban in the United States, which outlaws abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The week before the Mississippi legislation was signed into law, Kentucky <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/federal-judge-puts-strict-kentucky-abortion-law-hold-n865941">attempted to ban</a> abortion after just 11 weeks. Other states like South Carolina and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/20/595211551/ohio-gop-introduces-bill-to-ban-abortion">Ohio</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>are debating an outright ban of abortion and legislators in Iowa are considering a ban on abortion when a heartbeat is detected. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The threat to bodily autonomy is here and it is real. The bills that these states have passed and are considering can prompt a legal challenge that would make its way to the Supreme Court to challenge Roe v. Wade. Yet, here in Rhode Island, legislators refuse to take action to protect those living in the state, as we prepare for a potentially post-Roe v. Wade world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In Rhode Island, existing antiquated and, in some cases, unconstitutional laws could completely outlaw abortion services. Several chapters of Rhode Island laws make it a criminal offense to perform an abortion or help a woman obtain one. A law that is still on the books that followed the ever-important 1973 Roe v. Wade decision defines human life as commencing “at the instant of conception.” Another law requires a married woman to notify her husband before she can terminate a pregnancy and actually prohibits insurers from covering the procedure. Despite our overwhelmingly democratic state government, Rhode Island is incredibly hostile to reproductive rights and freedom. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To address this issue, some Rhode Island lawmakers have introduced the Reproductive Health Care Act. The Act would prohibit the state or any of its agencies from interfering with any individual’s reproductive health care, including the ability to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability or after that point in cases when necessary to preserve the woman’s health or life. It would eliminate the several laws that (at least for now) unconstitutionally limit access to abortion, and repeal laws about definitions of life and permission seeking. In essence, the RHCA would codify Roe v. Wade into state law and protect the fundamental human right to reproductive freedom and bodily autonomy while repealing laws that could restrict access to legal and safe health care for Rhode Islanders. In the current political climate, with an administration that is hostile to reproductive freedom, a Supreme Court in jeopardy, a conservative national Congress and an emboldened <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/11/community-members-voice-opinions-proposed-reproductive-health-bills/">pro-life movement within the state</a>, the need to act is urgent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The leadership of both the Rhode Island State Senate and House has refused to act and codify Roe v. Wade into state law to keep abortion safe and legal in the state. Consequently, it is on us to take action and hold them accountable. The fight for reproductive freedom is at a breaking point and we must take action. We must rally, talk to our elected officials and demand a vote on this important bill. We must secure these protections now, rather than reacting later to the rights of millions being taken away. To the Rhode Island House and Senate leadership, the time to act is now.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In recent years, American medical schools have publicly committed to enhancing the diversity of their student bodies. In its diversity and inclusion <a href="https://www.aamc.org/initiatives/diversity/">mission statement</a>, the Association of American Medical Colleges promises to “cultivate human capital” by collaborating with institutions of medical education to “use diversity as a driver of excellence.” Similarly, Brown’s <a href="https://brown.edu/web/documents/diversity/actionplan/diap-full.pdf">own Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan states</a> that the University will take tangible steps to “identify, recruit and retain faculty, students and staff who have been historically underrepresented in higher education.” More specifically, the Alpert Medical School <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-diversity/pathways/implementation/people">has set out to</a> “develop a diverse graduate and medical student body at Brown, with the specific goal of doubling the number of graduate students from historically underrepresented groups by 2020-2022.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, two of the most underrepresented groups in medicine are individuals who are undocumented or recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. To be clear, medical schools often treat the two groups differently; the Medical School, for example, <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/medical/admission/apply/requirements-and-criteria/eligibility">accepts applications from DACA students, but does not accept applications from undocumented students</a>. But when it comes to medical school admission, undocumented students should not be denied the consideration afforded to their DACA counterparts just because they might have missed a certain eligibility date. Medical schools should not, and cannot afford to, leave these students behind. At the moment there <a href="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/with-three-months-left-in-medical-school-her-career-may-be-slipping-away/2018/02/22/24a7a780-10f3-11e8-9570-29c9830535e5_story.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524697042350000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNp9PFqbjrPOMDayUq43MdM-7iSA">about 100 DACA medical students</a> in the United States; approximately 32 of them are at Loyola University Chicago’s Stritch School of Medicine. Because of DACA and undocumented medical students’ potential to make meaningful contributions to American health care — and because we have an ethical obligation to honor their humanity — I call upon medical schools across the country to proactively work to increase the representation of DACA and undocumented individuals in medicine. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DACA was implemented in 2012 following the failure of the DREAM Act in Congress in 2010. In order <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-questions">to qualify</a> for DACA status, an individual must be under the age of 31, have entered the country prior to age 16, resided continuously in the U.S. since 2007 and have no record of a felony or record of three or more misdemeanors. Approximately 800,000 individuals benefit from DACA; this number has fallen since the suspension of DACA in September 2017. Despite the benefits of DACA — which allows recipients to obtain a <a href="https://www.nilc.org/issues/daca/daca-after-trump-q-and-a/">work permit</a>, a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/deferred_action.pdf">social security number</a> and a driver’s license — access to medical school remains limited at best. <a href="https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2017/11000/Considerations_for_Residency_Programs_Regarding.16.aspx">According to the AAMC</a>, 26 DACA students applied to medical school in 2014, 46 in 2015 and 113 in 2016. Eight students checked the DACA category on their Electronic Residency Application Service form in 2015 and at least three did in 2016. Currently, leaders of Pre-Health Dreamers — an organization empowering undocumented youth to pursue health careers — whom I personally know estimate that at least eight DACA students matched into residency programs this 2018 cycle. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The low but rapidly increasing number of applicants is a testament to the barriers DACA and undocumented students must overcome before their application lands in the hands of admissions committees. DACA students are not eligible for federal loans or aid, which typically form the basis of most financial aid packages at medical schools across the country. Many medical schools, especially state schools, do not consider DACA applicants — such as my home state’s public medical school, despite years of my paying taxes that benefited the medical school and state health care system. In my personal experience, some state schools, like those in California, offer aid to DACA medical students who are in-state but do not offer any aid to out-of-state individuals. Furthermore, some schools in Texas will not allow DACA students to matriculate despite being accepted, as was <a href="http://www.texasstandard.org/stories/students-in-immigration-status-limbo-lack-medical-school-options/">the case with a colleague of mine</a>. At times, a DACA student’s access to medical school is highly predicated on their state of residence. With a limited number of medical schools to apply to and the uncertainty of securing financial aid, DACA students are at a disadvantage from the start. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This disparity is unfortunate because DACA and undocumented medical graduates could help reduce the country’s growing physician shortage and support efforts to bolster the cultural competency of the American medical system. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28562450">AAMC’s diversity and inclusion report</a> estimates an overall shortage of 104,900 physicians by 2030, with vulnerable populations most affected. (The same report also found that the country will experience a deficit of 33,800 to 72,700 specialty care physicians by 2030.) Most DACA students hail from underserved communities themselves, and many express a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hast.780">desire to serve underserved communities</a>. In a letter to Congress, the American Medical Association estimates that in the coming decades DACA students could contribute more than five thousand primary care physicians, thus helping to alleviate some of <a href="https://www.aamc.org/download/485292/data/healthprofessionscallfordacafix.pdf">the shortage</a>. As such, medical schools should proactively recruit and support DACA and undocumented students, as they are a largely untapped source of talent. With their community-based experience and expertise — <a href="https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2017/11000/Considerations_for_Residency_Programs_Regarding.16.aspx?">98 percent are multilingual</a> — DACA medical school graduates are well-positioned to navigate the intersection of politics and the the social determinants of health. After all, as Rudolf Virchow, the father of social medicine once said, “Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing more than medicine on a large scale.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beyond pragmatic concerns, however, medical schools should open their doors to DACA and undocumented students because it is the ethical thing to do. The Hippocratic Oath, taken by physicians upon their induction into the medical profession, states: “I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.” The modern-day Hippocratic Oath is in many ways a code of conduct, a guiding principle for the ethical practice of medicine. I believe this oath applies not only to our treatment of patients but also to how we treat our colleagues and our fellow human beings. With this in mind, in my opinion it is short-sighted to think about increasing the representation of DACA and undocumented individuals in medicine solely using a pragmatic framework. As current and future medical professionals, we ought to open doors in times of crisis to raise the next generation of physician leaders who will advocate for the health of America’s increasingly diverse patient population. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In line with the University’s DIAP goals, I believe that the Medical School should start recruiting undocumented students and improve its efforts to recruit DACA students. As a private institution, the Medical School has the ability to accommodate these students in ways that state institutions may not due to state regulations. By partnering with local banks and creating a financial aid fund for DACA and undocumented students — in the <a href="https://ssom.luc.edu/daca/">model of Loyola</a>, which has partnered with in-state financial institutions to provide interest-free loans to DACA students — to help reduce the burden of private loans, the Medical School has the opportunity to lead the way among Ivy League medical schools. Some peer institutions, <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/education/admissions/index.aspx">like Yale</a>, already do accept applications from and provide aid to undocumented medical school applicants. I believe now is the perfect opportunity for the Medical School community to come together and continue to pave the way in medical education by proactively working to train the next generation of diverse leaders in the American health care workforce. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The experience of growing up undocumented instilled in me a hyper-awareness of the fragility of my family’s place in U.S. society. It exposed me to the injustices of our current immigration system from an early age and has shaped a large part of who I am. My dad has always encouraged us to lead as normal of a life as possible, claiming we couldn’t let our legal status wedge itself between us and our happiness and aspirations. Millions of mixed-legal-status families develop their own defense mechanisms against the crippling fear of being separated. My dad battled internalizing the idea of being an outsider, or an “alien,” as immigrants are referred to by our legal system, in a country that has been his home for over 20 years by maintaining a jovial optimism and unwavering faith that things would “work themselves out.” Recently, however, our administration’s divisive, criminilizating and anti-immigrant rhetoric, along with sobering statistics such as 2017’s 40-percent rise in immigration arrests carried out by the unscrupulous Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, have made it increasingly difficult to be so optimistic. A message is being sent loud and clear: Immigrant families are under attack and no one is safe. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It became increasingly clear to me that any moment the four of us spent together could be our last. As a student, that is why, this past spring break, I forewent travel with friends and educational opportunities, opting to spend the entire week with my family. It is the reason why I prioritized being home for my upcoming summer plans rather than seeking internships in a major metropolis. Throughout the semester, I constantly face the guilt of being hundreds of miles from home and have to remind myself of the privilege of having access to a Brown education and the ways in which it can ameliorate my family’s situation, especially as a first-gen student from a low-income background. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When I do have the opportunity to be home with my family, I cherish every second of it: the group labor of making a meal together, my parents’ recounting of their lives, laughing hysterically at my dad’s jokes and observing the wrinkles that have formed around my parents’ eyes when they smile. The uncertainty of our future makes me wish these moments would last forever. I experienced our time spent together with a heightened sense of awareness, wanting to slow it down and freeze it so I could soak it all in and never forget any of it. I once read a book in which the characters defined their love by how deeply they missed each other when they were together. They felt the loss before it happened, and their love was defined by that loss, a type of melancholy love, and fierce nostalgia for the present. It’s the closest description I have to the feeling of being home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The morning of April 13, when my mom called, she didn’t even have to say the words. Her tone, when cautiously asking me if I was in class, said it all. Our fears had materialized, and although I had known for so long that this could happen, nothing could have prepared me for that moment. My dad had been arrested by ICE officials near our home on his way to work. Although they had no right to do this without a warrant, they used intimidation tactics to startle him into believing that his cooperation with them was in his best interest. He went along with their questioning and, a few moments later, he was in handcuffs. That morning, I stayed on the phone with my mom, who was desperately trying to keep it together. She told me to inform my sister because she couldn’t gather the strength to do so at that moment. I made the call. “It happened. Dad was arrested. Take a moment but be strong. Mom needs you.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I was initially in a state of shock and at a complete loss for what to do. My dad’s over-optimistic attitude had always gotten in the way of us creating a contingency plan for this moment, as if refusing to acknowledge the issue was some sort of protection from our reality. I went to class that morning and slipped a note to my professor, asking her to excuse me in case I had to leave to take a call. It wasn’t until that afternoon, after lying in my bed for a few hours feeling numb, that I decided to reach out to a dean from the Office of Student Support Services to ask about support for an extension on a paper. My conversation with him helped me snap out of my trance. He made it clear I wasn’t alone, walked me through the next steps and helped me get home the following day. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I spent a week and half learning about the intricate details of my dad’s case, navigating the difficult process of acquiring proper legal representation and brainstorming ways to raise the funds for the astronomical costs of the process ahead of us. It has been a life-altering experience to see my dad tear up, wearing an orange jumpsuit, sitting behind a glass. Our country has, without a doubt, a broken and outdated immigration system. It is uncertain how many months my dad will remain detained in a correctional facility in Battle Creek, Michigan, attempting to avoid deportation, while we work on his case. From what I have gathered from studying my dad’s case, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 that amended the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act creates major complications in his defense. Although my dad lawfully entered the United States in the 1990s, he returned to Mexico in the mid-2000s to handle a family matter. When he tried to re-enter the United States shortly after with a valid visa, he was turned away because of records of over-staying his previous visa. Knowing he couldn’t uproot his family from the life we had created here, he took on the dangers of crossing the U.S.-Mexico border on foot. The INA deems this “unlawful” re-entry across this man-made border — even though he did it for the purpose of reuniting with his family — a critical part of this case. Since he falls under the categories of “entry without inspection” and has accrued more than a year of “unlawful presence,” if he leaves the United States, even under voluntary proceedings after his detention, he is likely to be barred from coming back home for up to 10 years. Technically, this ban can be suspended, but only for individuals who can demonstrate to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency that their deportation would result in “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse or parent. USCIS does not consider hardship to the immigrant themselves or their children, even if the children are U.S. citizens. Fortunately, my mom is a lawful permanent resident spouse. Unfortunately, the ambiguous terminology and nearly impossible burden of proof in meeting this standard — along with the system’s indifference to the effects of separating a family — are a couple of the reasons why the odds are stacked against us. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The separation of families takes place in communities all over the country. Recent cases, such as the expedited deportation of DACA-protected 23-year old Manuel Montes and new ICE policies targeting activists and immigrants without criminal convictions — not to mention the removal of exemptions for the detainment of pregnant women — display the increased callousness of this federal law enforcement agency and its disregard for human rights in the name of “national security.” The largest workplace raid in a decade took place in Tennessee earlier this month. It demonstrates the impact of this issue on education and our youth; more than 500 students missed school the next day in the area affected. There are 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country. The message being sent is that they are undeserving of basic rights and protections from the wrath of our immigration system, simply because they were born outside of our border. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My dad’s story is one of many. There is a Spanish saying: “la lucha sigue.” The fight continues. We must find ways to come together, resist and bring awareness to this issue. Personally, I’m back on campus, and as I prepare for final exams I remain the main point of contact for lawyers and will continue to advise my family from my dorm room. It is a reminder of my immigrant reality. The only difference is that, unlike many others who go through this in silence and with limited support, I have been able to count on the love and support of my community back home and my community at Brown. We must continue to stay aware on these daily issues that are devastating the lives of our immigrant friends and neighbors.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you wish to support my family as we fight my dad’s case, you can continue to share our story, contact me or donate to our<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/supportkeepmyfamilytogether"> GoFundMe.</a> Thank you.</span></p>

		<title>Dolan ’19.5, Triedman &#039;20: Ratty air conditioning plans need more accountability</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">On April 23, in an editorial entitled “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/23/editorial-ratty-renovations-heartening-sign/">Ratty renovations a heartening sign</a>,” the Editorial Page Board of The Herald praised the University administration’s recent commitments to address overheating in the Sharpe Refectory. Although the Student Labor Alliance is also cautiously optimistic about the prospect of change in the Ratty, our emphasis falls more on the side of caution than optimism. Our skepticism hinges on two critically important points that have so far been ignored in the response to the Ratty renovations: First, the action taken by the University so far has been misconstrued, leading to a lack of public scrutiny and accountability; and second, without this public accountability and oversight, we cannot be sure that Brown’s promises and material commitments will lead to substantive improvements to working conditions in the Ratty kitchens.</p>
<p class="p3">Though they are steps in the right direction, the actions taken so far by the University have been overly celebrated and praised, leading to misunderstandings about progress made in the campaign and ultimately leaving the University unaccountable. For example, one sentence in the opening paragraph of The Herald’s editorial reads, “We applaud the University for taking and making public concrete action to enhance working conditions in the Ratty.” Let us not overstate which actions the University has actually agreed to. The SLA has received written confirmation from the administration that Brown has committed to spending $4 million on revamping the Ratty’s electrical system, expanding temporary cooling systems and short-term fixes for overheating in coming summers and conducting a feasibility study for other “permanent cooling solutions.” The money currently allocated to electrical improvements and the feasibility study does not fund any installation of air conditioning. To be extremely clear, the University has financially and verbally committed to studying the possibility of air conditioning implementation — not to actually installing air conditioning. Further, the administration has only agreed to install air conditioning pending the results of the feasibility study. As part of the announcement that has won them so much praise, administrators have given themselves a legitimate-sounding excuse to use should the cost of respecting workers’ rights to a safe workplace prove to be higher than expected.</p>
<p class="p3">The SLA is also skeptical of the University’s dedication to the renovation plan. While The Herald reported that the University has “announced” its plan in the April 13 news article “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/13/sharpe-refectory-gain-cooling-abilities-2019/">Sharpe Refectory to gain cooling abilities in 2019</a>,” in reality, the administration has thus far released no statement of its own. Despite the SLA’s urging of the administration to release such a statement — which would allow students to hold the administration accountable to the statement should it stray from it — it has refused to do so. By using The Herald article as a public statement, the administration has shielded itself from public pressure, and placed the author of the article in the unfair position of messenger. Until there has been an official statement from the University that outlines their concrete action steps and the timeline by which they will be implemented, workers and students cannot hold the administration accountable.</p>
<p class="p3">In the aftermath of this supposed commitment from the University, the SLA is demanding four things of the administration. First, the administration should make an official statement on behalf of the University — do not use students in The Herald as your shield against accountability. Second, this statement must include a timeline and detailed outline of the action steps taken in both parts of the renovation plan. Third, there must be interim measures taken during the two summers that will pass before potential air conditioning installation. These measures must be taken per the demands of Ratty workers. Fourth, there must be an establishment of an accountability working group composed of administrative members, dining service workers and students. This working group should meet regularly throughout the next several summers and school years to ensure that the University is conducting the feasibility study and both phases in a transparent fashion and following through on its promises.</p>
<p class="p3">The Herald’s editorial concludes with the comment, “we hope the University executes the goals outlined in its recent announcement, develops a permanent fix for working conditions in the Ratty and continues to address, in a timely fashion, the concerns of all its employees.” After years of repeatedly asking for air conditioning, it is clear that the concerns of Ratty employees were not addressed in a “timely fashion.” While we are glad that the University has finally acknowledged the need to address overheating in the Ratty, we are concerned about the lack of accountability for these changes. The SLA will continue to pressure the administration until it offers a concrete timeline, presents adequate accountability mechanisms and takes the interim measures that workers need over the next two summers.</p>

		<title>Morley &#039;13: Rescind Junot Díaz&#039;s Honorary Doctorate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Junot Díaz has been accused of sexual assault and misogynistic verbal abuse. I won’t reiterate the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/books/junot-diaz-accusations.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accusations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here, nor will I go into the virulent objectification of women common throughout Díaz’s body of literary work, nor the barely veiled authorial self-insertion with which it was delivered. You all have Google. More important is divesting our academic institution of its unfortunate symbiosis with Díaz. As one of Brown’s many non-donating indebted alums, I urge the University and President Christina Paxson P’19 to rescind Díaz’s honorary doctorate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Díaz’s alleged abuse of the power endowed by literary recognition, even if not necessarily criminal, demands response from his enablers, hangers-on and mutual cultural beneficiaries. The University, which granted Díaz an Honorary Doctorate of Letters in 2013, is one such beneficiary.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Honorary degrees, charitably, are a way to recognize people doing work that the University sees as representative of its values, particularly if those people didn’t have the luck and resources to enter the ivory tower of higher education.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncharitably, honorary degrees are Mammonistic PR, a way for academic power to easily and cheaply reinforce itself, shoring up its legitimacy by linking to other power structures within society. In highlighting someone like a hip literary wunderkind, Brown likely gets an alumni donation bump, student application recognition, perhaps donations from literary institutions and the general free media buzz that comes with cultural darlings. Maybe the recipient will later on even take a special interest in the institution, preferably monetary or money-adjacent, such as having a child or wealthy friend’s child apply and almost certainly attend.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In return, Díaz gets to add another degree to his resume, gets more renown and respect as an Important Intellectual in the publishing and academic spheres. Plus, he gets to do more of whatever he wants to do safe in the knowledge that he can turn to the degree-granting institution for support that is, again, preferably monetary or money-adjacent, such as implicitly or explicitly vouching for his legitimacy in the event of a publicity fiasco.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This setup is akin to the remora and the shark, the clownfish and the anemone, the squirrel and the acorn. The pact gives the two participants more of their desired power at almost no personal cost, until one of the beneficiaries loses their status. That’s when the relationship turns parasitic: a help for one, a harm to the other.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the revelation of his private misogyny, Díaz should rightly lose his place in the contemporary literary pantheon. Brown’s endorsement of his work and ideas, which now prominently feature chronic, unironic misogyny as opposed to the thoughtful deconstruction of the same that so many of our cultural arbiters presumed he was performing, now does Brown a disservice while giving Díaz a crutch to lean on. Charitably or otherwise, this is not a good look for the brand of an academic entity supposedly interested in social justice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do the right thing, President Paxson, and rescind Díaz’s honorary doctorate. I won’t give you money or exposure or tax credits to do it, though I promise that making concrete the ideals your institution espouses has its own particular return on investment.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><i>Editor’s note: This column is part of a two-part piece on the Brown History Education </i><i>Initiative and the Brown Incarceration Initiative. For a Brown student’s perspective, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/05/kupetz-19-5-in-favor-of-the-brown-incarceration-initiative/">click here</a>.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><span class="s1">Jean-Paul Sartre said, “As far as men go, it is not what they are that interests me, but what they may become.” For someone convicted of a serious crime and serving a lengthy prison sentence, this simple statement is especially meaningful. It speaks of hope and faith in the redemptive spirit existing within us all. It also forecasts a future full of possibility for those who are given the tools and opportunity to succeed.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Upon receiving my sentence, I felt the world collapse around me. Any hope or faith I may have had were squelched in an instant. Sadly, I retreated within myself and tried to close out the world. I was attempting to resign myself to the bleak and hopeless future I believed lay ahead. But, try as I might, I could not kill completely that engine which seemingly drives us all: curiosity, the desire to know and understand. So I began to read — and the world opened up to me.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In prison I discovered a love for learning I never knew existed. The more I read and the more I learned, the thirstier I became. The next logical step, and the only way I believed I could sate my growing thirst, was to pursue a college education, an endeavor I would never even have considered before coming to prison (economic and social roadblocks being the main deterrents). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unfortunately for millions of Americans like myself, who, for one reason or another, now find themselves on the wrong side of a cell door, chasing the dream of a college education has become a challenge fraught with all manner of obstacles. Access and availability loom the largest. Yet, there is a deeper, more ominous hindrance facing those striving to better themselves from behind the walls of a prison: the notion that we are no longer worthy, that somehow, upon entering the prison system, we surrendered our humanity at the gate and have been forever recast as undesirables — men and women incapable of reform or redemption.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So when I first heard rumors that Brown may be considering offering accredited courses and possibly a degree program here at the ACI, my interest and excitement were piqued. I thought to myself, “Finally the fog of fear and disdain are beginning to lift.” With the implementation of such a program, Brown, one of the most revered and respected institutions of higher learning in the world, would be emphatically saying, “These men and women have value. If we as a society are serious about solving the problem of mass incarceration, we can no longer relegate these men and women to the unending vortex of that vicious cycle. We must be proactive!”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An opportunity to shed the stigma and stereotypes associated with incarceration, a chance to prove to society as well as to ourselves that, if we are provided the means, not only will we succeed but we will flourish — well, that would be invaluable!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the spirit of Jean-Paul Sartre’s sentiment, Mumia Abu-Jamal, in his epic work “Live from Death Row,” asks, “What societal interest is served by prisoners who remain illiterate? What societal benefit is there in ignorance? How are people corrected while imprisoned if their education is outlawed? Who profits (other than the prison establishment itself) from stupid prisoners?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I end this now by posing the same questions to you.</span></p>

		<title>Kupetz ’19.5: In favor of the Brown Incarceration Initiative</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Editor's note: This column is part of a two-part piece on the Brown History Education </i><i>Initiative and the Brown Incarceration Initiative. For an incarcerated student's perspective, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/05/pontbriant-testament-power-education-prison/">click here</a>.</i>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jeremy Pontbriant is incarcerated in the medium security facility at the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institute. A deep thinker, inquisitive questioner, voracious learner and dedicated scholar, Pontbriant is just one example of a student who would benefit from the creation of the Brown Incarceration Initiative, a program that would offer courses bearing University credit and taught by University professors to people incarcerated at the ACI. Pontbriant wrote the adjacent letter outlining the need for and potential impacts of such a program. We must learn from and honor Pontbriant’s words and demand the creation of a “Brown Incarceration Initiative.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I met Pontbriant over a year ago, as a Teacher’s Assistant in a course he was enrolled in at the ACI. Soon after I introduced myself to the class, Pontbriant and his classmate told me that my voice sounded familiar. We realized that we had previously talked — not face to face — but through recordings that traveled past Brown’s Van Wickle gates and through the barbed wire fences and metal detectors of the prison. Pontbriant and I were enrolled in Professor of History Amy Remensnyder’s course HIST 0150C: “Locked Up: A Global History of Prison and Captivity” at the same time. The course had two sections — one of Brown students, and another comprising incarcerated individuals in the state. Despite the many institutional and physical barriers that separated me and Pontbriant, Professor Remensnyder found a way to facilitate discussion between our two classes — we asked and answered questions via tape recorder. Pontbriant remembered my voice from one of the recordings. We were classmates. But while I received University course credit for my participation in and completion of the course, Pontbriant did not. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Professor Remensnyder, along with other professors in the History department, teaches college-level history courses at the ACI through the Brown History Educational Prison Program. The University fails to officially recognize students in the program or award them college credit. Recognizing this injustice, professors and students at Brown (like those at Yale and Harvard) are calling on Brown to join schools such as Columbia and Bard College in granting incarcerated students course credit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">During the spring of 2018, Professor Remensnyder, in partnership with Professor of American Studies and Public Humanities Susan Smulyan and Assistant Director for Programs at the John Nicholas Brown Center Marisa Brown, submitted a proposal to the administration, calling for a Brown Incarceration Initiative. The proposal has garnered the support of over 250 faculty members and students thus far. The status of the proposal is in limbo, as we are waiting for the administration to take action. As an elite university with a mission to “serve the community, the nation and the world,” Brown ought to use its power to recognize that our incarcerated classmates — and the incarcerated population as a whole — are people, worthy of not only access to education, but of credit for their work.</span></p>

		<title>Miller: University should safeguard researchers’ independence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Criticism is part of science — indeed, science couldn’t move forward without it — but sometimes that criticism can be brutal. Assistant Professor of the Practice of Behavioral and Social Sciences Lisa Littman is getting a taste of that right now in the reaction to her paper on rapid-onset gender dysphoria. Wednesday’s article in The Herald detailed some of this criticism, which included claims that Littman’s study was “flat-out bad research,” that it was “incredibly dangerous” and that it would “do a lot of damage” to trans youth and the LGBTQ+ community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some of these reactions are to be expected and reflect the workings of the scientific process. A study exploring the origins of sexual self-identity, whatever its findings, is bound to provoke strong reactions and pushback from those who are skeptical. Detailed critical analysis of her methodology, including the fact that she relied on surveys of parents rather than interviews with the youth themselves, is clearly called for, and the journal that published it has said as much. This, too, is part of the scientific process. If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen, as the saying goes, and that clearly applies to research on human sexual identity. Littman’s provocative study is getting plenty of critical attention, and that’s a good thing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> I wish I could say the same for Brown’s institutional reaction to such criticism. In frank terms, it has been nothing short of shameful. One would expect a university devoted to open inquiry and academic freedom to vigorously defend the independence of its researchers, and to support their efforts to investigate even the most controversial topics. Instead, Brown cowered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It removed references to Littman’s paper from its “news distribution” web sites, and then published a statement from Dean Bess Marcus of the School of Public Health that implicitly undercut the work of its own researcher. While Marcus’ letter contained fine words regarding academic freedom, it simultaneously implied that Littman had not properly listened “to multiple perspectives” or recognized the “limitations” of her work. The same letter indicated that Marcus would organize “a panel of experts to present the latest research in this area and to define directions for future work to optimize health in transgender communities.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While no one could argue with the goal of optimizing health in such communities, there is little doubt that such a panel would be organized in a way to explicitly challenge the work of this junior faculty member, reject her methodology and conclusions and even undermine her decision to investigate the topic of gender dysphoria itself. Marcus went further, citing concerns from members of the Brown community that “conclusions of the study could be used to discredit the efforts to support transgender youth and invalidate perspectives of members of the transgender community.” What she did not explain is why a speculative fear of how research findings could be used by unnamed individuals should play any role in determining the academic merit of Littman’s work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> These actions send a very clear message to every member of the research community at Brown. If your investigation engenders substantial social criticism from stakeholders, whether inside or outside of the University community, Brown will run and hide. It will bury your research findings, surrender to the most vocal of your critics and then call in “experts” to wash its hands of the whole affair.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Jeffrey Flier, former Dean of Harvard Medical School, wrote in a recent opinion piece, the stakes are very high for the University at this point. “Its leaders must not allow any single politically charged issue ­— including gender dysphoria — from becoming the thin edge of a wedge that gradually undermines our precious, hard-won academic freedoms.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be clear, I am not calling for Brown to defend the specific work in question. Littman’s study may well be poorly designed, methodologically flawed or incorrectly interpreted. That will be for the larger scientific community to decide, and decide it will. But what Brown must do is to affirm the right of its researchers to take on the most difficult questions in science and society and to stand up for their independence when challenged. This it has failed to do, undercutting the work of every researcher at this institution. On this point I stand with Littman, and I hope the rest of our research community will do the same.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Some say we’re reaching the point of no return with the effects of climate change. To be clear, we’re not just running out of time; we are out of time. <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/fighting-fire-with-fire-california-turns-to-prescribed-burning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forest fires</a> rage, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/us/hurricane-harvey-houston.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hurricanes</a> decimate islands and coastlines, asthma rates are <a href="http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2018/09/04/the-science-is-clear-we-need-a-stronger-smog-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climbing</a> and we just experienced the hottest August ever <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/news/us-experiences-5th-warmest-summer-on-record" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded</a> in Rhode Island. We must make major changes now or our life here on this planet will be dismal, with many people unable to survive.</p>
<p class="p1">Climate Action RI, a volunteer non-profit organization that originated as an offshoot of Resist Hate RI in early 2017, knows that climate change is not just an environmental fight, but also a fight against social and ethical injustice. Across our nation and here in Rhode Island, low-income neighborhoods and communities of color are already bearing the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/climate-change-global-climate-action-summit/568069/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burden</a> of climate change as corporate interests are put before the health and well-being of people. As fossil fuel companies build infrastructure in these communities, black, brown and indigenous people are hit early and hard by an economy built on extraction and abuse that fails to accommodate the needs of all people. Thousands of people in the United States — most of them from communities overlooked and ignored time and time again — will die from the disastrous effects of unchecked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/climate/epa-coal-pollution-deaths.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greenhouse</a> emissions enabled by irresponsible government leaders.</p>
<p class="p1">At CARI, we are no longer just talking about what needs to be done to mitigate climate change, but taking direct action to wake up the public and our elected officials to the catastrophe already unfolding. Over fifty years ago, people took a stand and marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, against the crimes of racial injustice. It was a tipping point in the public’s consciousness. Today we see that the Civil Rights Movement was the beginning of a long fight that goes on to this day. We are hoping that the actions we are taking — along with many other environmental organizations — will create a movement so strong and effective that it can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p class="p1">We are taking bold action to fight for environmental justice and standing in solidarity with the communities that are being hit first and the hardest. It is for this reason that we will be joining people from all over the world to participate in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1974622775929415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rise for Climate, Jobs and Justice</a> — on Saturday, September 8, at 6:00pm at Roger Williams National Monument Park — to demand real climate leadership from our elected officials and an end to the fossil fuel era. Renewable energy has never been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/01/13/renewable-energy-cost-effective-fossil-fuels-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cheaper</a> or easier to obtain. It’s time for governments and the business community to embrace the inevitable renewable energy revolution.</p>
<p class="p1">At the Rhode Island Rise for Climate Justice event, we’re asking the public to connect the dots between extreme weather and climate change. We’re also rising up against Providence’s popular WaterFire sponsored by National Grid to protest the company’s <a href="https://www.ecori.org/renewable-energy/2018/9/5/protest-ahead-of-local-and-global-climate-demonstrations">plan</a> to build a liquefied natural gas facility in the Port of Providence, adjacent to neighborhoods with some of the highest rates of <a href="https://www.ecori.org/social-justice-archive/2018/2/8/environmental-racism-live-and-well-on-the-south-side" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asthma</a> in the state. Our protest will be peaceful but very visible, and we invite the public to join in. Together we’ll show that people everywhere are building a movement committed to a just transition away from fossil fuels and an extractive economy to a regenerative one that accommodates everyone. As the leaders of The People’s Climate Movement who created the Rise for Climate, Jobs and Justice day of action said, “To change everything, we need everyone.” The time is now.</p>

		<title>Paxson P&#039;19, Locke P&#039;18: University committed to academic freedom, faculty support</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The University sets a very high bar for the research it publicizes. Among the literally hundreds of research studies published in peer-reviewed journals by University researchers over the course of a year, a small number are chosen to be highlighted on the University’s website and featured in our communications materials. We feel strongly that the research that is featured should reflect Brown’s dedication to the highest standards of academic excellence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not only does this align with our values as a research institution, it conveys to our research community the deep respect we have for the intellectual, professional and personal investment its members make in the meticulous practice of inquiry and discovery to advance knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This commitment to upholding academic standards sets the backdrop for a story that has been widely reported — and misreported — in the media, regarding a research article published by a Brown faculty member. We are writing to set the facts straight and restate our strong commitment to academic freedom for this faculty member and all researchers at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Aug. 16, the scientific peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE published an article on “rapid onset gender dysphoria” by Assistant Professor of the Practice of Behavioral and Social Sciences Lisa Littman. Though Brown’s Office of University Communications knew the subject matter of the research could generate controversy, it decided to feature the research in a press release posted on the University’s website Aug. 22. The University does not shy away from controversy in publicizing research that seeks to advance knowledge or debate in a research field.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the paper was published, the University started to hear serious concerns from leading academics in the field about the paper’s research design and methodology. Apparently, these concerns were also communicated separately to PLOS ONE because the journal announced Aug. 27 that it would take the unusual step of conducting a post-publication re-review of the article. The University has had no contact with the journal and played no part in its decision.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was in light of the journal’s determination — and consistent with our commitment to only publicize research that unassailably meets the highest standards of excellence — the University chose to remove a news release about the research from Brown’s website Aug. 27, after the journal’s announcement. This decision would have been made regardless of the subject matter of the research.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Any accusation that Brown does not support and defend academic freedom is false. We have seen this accusation articulated in various news media, including in a Sept. 6 Herald op-ed, “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/06/miller-university-should-safeguard-researchers-independence/">University should safeguard researchers’ independence</a>.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this age of “tweet first, ask questions later,” it has been assumed (without evidence) that the University “succumbed to political pressure.” In truth, the decision to cease publicity for the article instead reflects the value the University places on research standards and was not a response to any pressure from people unhappy with the content of the study. Neither has the University in any way censored the research, as some in the media have claimed. The article is still available on the PLOS ONE website and on the author’s Researchers@Brown page, which is maintained by the University.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, the University has in no way condemned Professor Littman’s research. In ceasing publicity for the article, the University has not drawn a judgement about whether or not the research meets the standards for research publication. As always, this determination is left to experts in the field through the peer review process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given the profound confusion on this matter, it’s important not only to state the facts but also to emphasize the University’s strong commitment to academic freedom. We wholeheartedly share with our faculty and the broader research community deep convictions with regard to academic freedom, intellectual independence and the fundamental role of universities in championing and defending researchers’ right to pursue inquiry on any issues of their choosing. We are committed to vigorously upholding these values along with adhering to the highest standards of academic excellence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We fully support Professor Littman and others in the School of Public Health and other disciplines in conducting research and seeking publication in the growing field of transgender health, as well as organizing seminars, panels or other forums to discuss scholarship on this topic. We have been steadfast in explaining to people who object to the content of this research that we stand by academic freedom and will not do anything to hinder this (or any) faculty member’s research. We believe deeply that upholding academic standards is not at odds with supporting our faculty and their freedom to pursue their research interests, even if that takes them into areas of inquiry that are controversial.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We believe just as strongly that we can devote ourselves to academic freedom while also confirming our long-standing support for members of the transgender community. We feel it’s critical that members of our community and the public not misinterpret expressions of support for transgender individuals as the motivation for discontinuing promotion of the gender dysphoria research. Brown is deeply committed to both supporting high-quality science and research that informs policy and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>practice, and sustaining an inclusive environment that respects the dignity of all members of our community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In short, academic freedom and inclusion are not mutually exclusive. We’re proud that Brown was among the first universities to include medical care for gender reassignment in its student health plan and that our medical school is a leader in education on care for transgender individuals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Academic freedom and support for the trans community — or any other group — are values that can and, indeed, must co-exist. They do at Brown.</span></p>

		<title>Nagayoshi: Consider teaching — especially if you’re a student of color</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re a person of color and passionate about social justice, try becoming a teacher. Our presence in the classroom has long-term implications on how future generations will come to navigate race, and now more than ever, our children need brilliant teachers of color.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You might hesitate at this thought. If you’re anything like I was as an undergrad, you might feel like you’re too impatient to handle kids, have concerns about pay (I hear you) or somehow feel — though we might not like to admit it — that teaching is beneath you. (I remember my friend once asked me point blank, “You went to Brown … to teach?”)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But if diversity, equity and inclusivity are values that resonate with you, then the teacher diversity problem in this country might make you think twice. Despite the growing number of non-white students, U.S. educators are disproportionately white. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, teachers of color represent a small percentage of the workforce, their retention is lower and they are underrepresented in leadership positions. Even in Massachusetts, the state I currently teach in, close to 97 percent of educators are white compared to the 31 percent of students of color. These stark racial disparities are worse in higher-needs districts that serve lower-income and racial minority populations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As an Asian American, I see and feel this underrepresentation every day — in the hallways of my school, in teacher preparation and development programs and at educator conferences. I am often among the very few, if not the only person, in these spaces to call out issues that directly affect our students of color. The percentage of Asian teachers in Massachusetts, for instance, is less than one percent, well below the proportion of Asian people in the area. It can feel isolating at times, but the effects of this teacher diversity gap are even more consequential for our kids.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We live in an increasingly hostile world for children of color — a world more indifferent to or actively discriminatory against the needs, perspectives and dreams of marginalized identities, where the line between fact and fiction is thinner than it ever was. Only through our visibility, proximity to and empathy for those who shape our future can we build the world we dream of.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’m a believer in the idea that our identities afford us a unique consciousness and the ability to teach others about our experiences. If you’re white, model to kids what it means to be an ally. If you’re male, teach young boys about toxic masculinity. If you speak Spanish, demonstrate the value of being multilingual. If you identify as LGBTQ+, listen to and amplify your students’ queer identities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For people of color (and for all non-majority identities), existence is political and often navigated through the lens of survival. As an educator of color, you have an opportunity to explore that consciousness with students — to push back against stereotypes, to oppose systemic injustice, to celebrate identity and culture and to model what it means to live unapologetically.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In other words, my fellow folks of color, y’all can be that teacher you wish you had growing up.</span></p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My name is Ryan Holt. I live on Halsey Street (right near campus) with my wife, Lilia, our rescue dog Stella and our two rescue cats Silvio and Cleo. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Lil and I were both born and raised right here in Providence. We both attended Classical High School in Providence. We both have successful careers — mine in law and hers in business development — and we share a lifelong passion for public service and civic engagement. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While I was born and raised in Elmhurst (near Providence College, from which I graduated in 2009), Lil grew up off of Hope Street where she spent her weekends observing the Jewish Shabbat with her grandparents on Elmgrove Avenue, enjoying art classes at RISD and attending Hebrew school at Temple Beth-El. We could not be happier that we chose to make our home on the East Side. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I am running to represent Ward 2 in the City Council because, Providence, the city I grew up in and am privileged enough to call home once again, is at a pivotal point. Undoubtedly, Providence is a city rich in cultural diversity and economic opportunity. Lilia and I believed in the promise of both, which is why we chose to stay in Providence rather than take post-college jobs in Boston, New York or San Francisco. But Providence also has persistent problems: deep-seated parochialism that divides neighborhoods rather than unites them, inconsistent policies that lead to educational inequality and a need-to-know-a-guy development culture that threatens our very community. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Still, my life experiences in this city have taught me never to give up on it or its people. I know what it’s like to be a boy from Elmhurst who bridged socio-economic divides at Classical to make friends with children from across this city — and to be the better for it. During those four years, I also learned how education policy differed by zip code, which is why I am the only candidate with a plan to address education inequality in our city. My recent experiences lobbying on behalf of organizations like the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence to help pass complicated, important and impactful legislation have prepared me to build coalitions and foster compromise. These experiences, right here in Providence, are why I am running to be your voice on the City Council — why I feel I have the policy platform needed to enhance Providence schools, build a dynamic economic climate in the city and ensure that Providence remains an attractive and inclusive destination for all people.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m running to fight for the families who wonder whether to send their children to our public schools. We need strong schools to prepare the young people of Providence for the 21st century. Let’s create a culture of accountability and support for our talented teachers and administrators, so that they can work to their fullest potential to ready our children for the competitive world of tomorrow. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m running to fight for the people who grew up here and who are attending school here but will soon be forced to leave due to a lack of jobs. We have so many talented people who call and who have called Providence their home. Let’s keep them here. We must create a Providence that attracts, retains and supports businesses rather than discourage them. We can do this together by supporting smart zoning, targeted city investments in growing industries and increased workforce development.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m fighting for the families and small business owners who feel disenfranchised by the bureaucratic runaround at City Hall. I’ll be an accessible, accountable and transparent leader who will be there for you — keeping our neighborhoods safe, answering your questions and helping you navigate the hallways of City Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m running for families and people who have raised children and grandkids here and want to keep Providence their home. We need to ensure that all of us, no matter what age, have the resources available to live here in dignity. We need to make sure that every member of our community is treated with respect and feels supported by their neighbors, regardless of age, race, religion, identity and cultural beliefs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m running for all of those who are proud of our amazing city and want to take it to the next level. Nothing that is wrong with our city can’t be fixed by what’s right with it. Providence possesses a unique culture, great restaurants, artistic outlets and so much more. Beyond that, the city’s biggest asset is its people. Throughout our city, there is talent, passion and drive. Let’s harness that together — not just as East Siders, but together with our neighbors throughout Providence. If we do that, there is nothing that can stop us from building a stronger, sustainable Providence we all can be proud of.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I need your vote to do this. That’s why I am asking your support today.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><em><span class="s1">Ryan Holt is a Providence native and a candidate for City Council (Ward 2) in today’s Democratic Primary. He can be reached at ryan@holtforcouncil.com.</span></em></p>
<p class="p5"><em><span class="s1">Other candidates running for Ward 2 seat in the City Council were also contacted by the opinions section but either declined to write an op-ed or did not respond to The Herald’s request. The Herald has not endorsed any candidates in the race.</span></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Soria &#039;19: The need for a student coalition for fair and ethical housing</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/16/soria-19-need-student-coalition-fair-ethical-housing/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While dorm space is available for students of all years, more and more juniors and seniors opt to live off-campus, as do a small number of sophomores. The reasons behind this decision may vary depending on the student. Many believe that Brown on-campus housing is quite expensive as it is — prohibitively so for students facing other financial difficulties. Others still prefer personal space and do not feel as comfortable sharing a dorm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Like many other seniors who automatically receive approval from the Office of Residential Life for off-campus housing, I decided to move into an apartment this year. In doing so, I have had to deal with landlords. It is no secret that housing both on- and off-campus is overpriced. On the one hand, there is the University, which has disproportionate share of the housing market on campus or closest to campus. On the other hand, we have a handful of landlords who often have inherited several houses, and collectively own most of the real estate that is offered for rent in the area. The conditions for greedy landlords to thrive are ripe. Because of the inflated prices that the University offers, many landlords in the area take advantage of such conditions to raise rent. Even though off-campus housing is still relatively cheaper than on-campus housing, students who opt for the former still find themselves paying more than they have to. For example, Zillow, an online real estate database, indicates that my off-campus house’s rental price per room should cost as little as $200 per month. If this is any indication of what rental prices in the area should be, these figures are much cheaper than the rates that students actually pay, which can range from $600 to well over $900. Due to this, students are not only overcharged, but they can receive poor services and condition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I need to clarify that not all landlords are exploitative. However, based on my own experience and what I have heard from my friends and acquaintances at Brown, it seems that many landlords take advantage of the fact that most students are renting an apartment for the first time, do not know the real estate prices in the area and are generally unfamiliar with the Rhode Island laws that are meant to protect tenants. Because of this, more and more students are charged overpriced rents and fees for apartments with conditions well below what we should expect, even if University on-campus housing cuts them a rawer deal. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thus, I urge the Brown student community, Brown Student Agencies, ResLife and the University as a whole, to push for the creation of an undergraduate and graduate student coalition that can help protect the rights of students as tenants with their respective landlords. The creation of such an initiative would allow students to fight for fairer prices and better living conditions, and it would also provide students with a network where they can ask past tenants about landlords, prices and houses, among other things. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As Brown decides to accept more students than it can house and while ResLife deals with staffing problems, housing issues will become more and more pressing for the community. These challenges directly affect student finances, mental health and overall well-being. I do not believe that any Facebook group created to offer a short-term solution will be able to solve this current and ever-growing problem. This is why the creation of a student-led coalition for fair and honest housing could help those undergraduate and graduate students who have struggled with their own housing or are in urgent need of housing.</span></p>

		<title>Rose ’19: Why is it so hard to be a barber in R.I.?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is broad, bipartisan agreement, from former president Barack Obama to Milton Friedman, that America today regulates away economic growth and opportunity by erecting unreasonable barriers to participation in labor markets. Lobbied by special interest groups, states have built ever-expanding mazes of difficult and bewildering red tape that discourage people from finding employment. One particularly egregious example of over-demanding licensing schemes can be found in Chapters 5-10 of the Rhode Island Statutes, which control the regulation of barbering and hairdressing in the state. Before you can legally make a dollar cutting hair, you have to have graduated high school. You must disclose all your criminal convictions, even though “ban the box” legislation made that policy illegal in the private sector five years ago. And, worst of all, you have to go through nine months of full-time training, when, for comparison, it takes only five months to become a police officer in the state. It’s too hard to get a job cutting hair, but luckily there is a very simple remedy: Repeal Chapters 5-10 of the Rhode Island Statutes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I think the current licensing system is unreasonably burdensome, but to prove that I first want to establish a framework for thinking about what makes a license reasonable in the first place. First, it seems reasonable to me that we should assume a sort of standing, a priori right that everyone has to engage in the market and provide for themselves. This right has the convenient effect of being associated with economic benefits as well. If people can freely enter a market and sell their services, not only do they get jobs, but they serve to raise the supply of the service they are producing. All else constant, this lowers the price of the service to a more competitive level, where producers are still happy to sell their services and consumers are even happier to buy them. In short, more economic freedom produces economic gains. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Second, it seems reasonable that we as a society, using the levers of government, should curtail that right if that one person’s right to practice any job with freedom sufficiently hurts other people. As has been said, my right to swing my fist ends where your face begins. Similarly, my right to be an open heart surgeon ends where your right not to die from malpractice begins. In other words, licensing makes a lot of sense when there is a harm to the public that outweighs the benefits. Conversely, if a license does so much harm to the agency of individuals and the economy overall that it outweighs the public harms the license was supposed to prevent, then it should get the boot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So, how do we know that Rhode Island’s hairdressing license is out of proportion? For one thing, it is very unclear that the license actually saves the public from any danger. A 2013 paper by Mark Klee finds, counterintuitively, that “neither overall licensing policy nor any dimension of licensing policy seems to aﬀect” the level of vocational training for cosmetologists. If you want safer haircuts, it seems that training-hour requirements are ineffective even at boosting the level of training in the labor force, let alone overall safety. Vox’s Matt Yglesias fairly points out that “People don’t die of bad haircuts, and since hairstyle is a quintessential matter of taste, there’s absolutely no reason to think consumers can’t figure out for themselves who has a decent reputation as a cutter of hair.” Approach the question from a third angle: Have you ever gotten a haircut you were unsatisfied with from a Rhode Island barbershop? I’ll go out on a limb and say that despite the presence of low-quality haircuts in the market, you still probably managed to find yourself a different haircutter that met your standards. Indeed, Britain has no licensing for hairdressers at all, and people manage. Here’s the essential question: Is saving yourself from a bad haircut, keeping in mind that there is pretty solid evidence that the current licensing system is bad at doing that, worth denying people access to a livelihood? Is it worth making haircuts more expensive for you and everyone else in the state?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As dubious as the costs of freedom are, the costs of licensing are pretty staggering. Licensing of barbers reduces the probability of a black individual working as a barber by 17.3 percent, according to a study published by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Every 100 hours of training required adds $2.15 to the price of beauty salon visits. Licensing, by making it more difficult for job-seekers to enter new lines of business and employment, harms social mobility. And, as an Obama White House report notes, low-income entrepreneurship activity takes a hit as well. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Is the current licensing system worth it? I sure don’t think so. But, lest you think there’s a coherent defense to be made of the current system that I’m not portraying, consider this: The official definitions for hairdressing and barbering in Rhode Island state law are each around 100 words and share nine key phrases — but, in the eyes of the law, they are different professions, with different licensing requirements. Both occupations deal with “cutting” hair. Both work on the “scalp, face, or neck.” Both color hair. Both dress hair. The list goes on to frustration, and it’s very hard to imagine catching a clever barber masquerading as a hairdresser, inflicting hidden terror on the population by having escaped training with fully 300 hours less than they needed to be safe. The truth is, nobody — not even the author of these licensing rules — has put forward a reasonable explanation for the system as it stands. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The larger battle over how much occupational licensing is too much is not going to be resolved today, nor should it be. There are gray areas, occupations where good arguments exist on each side of the debate. But hairdressing is an easy case. Our community should not allow such an obviously counterproductive policy to continue.</span></p>

		<title>Kupetz ’19.5: In defense of the Brown Incarceration Initiative</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When The Herald published my article, “In Favor of the Brown Incarceration Initiative,” alongside Jeremy Pontbriant’s beautiful article, “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/05/pontbriant-testament-power-education-prison/">A Testament to the Power of Education in Prison</a>,” a few weeks back, I did not expect to write this reply. I am upset that somebody read Pontbriant’s article and left with the takeaway: “I must google the crime for which he was incarcerated.” I am upset that The Herald would publish a letter that attacks Pontbriant’s character and fails to engage thoughtfully with his argument. I am upset that Pontbriant has been put on trial once again, forced to defend his humanity when he seeks only to improve himself through study.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I do not want to speak for Pontbriant, as he can best speak for himself. However, due to prison rules that make communication challenging, it will take some time to receive and publish Pontbriant’s response. In the meantime, I will share some of what I have learned about the prison-industrial complex in classes, through organizing work, and most importantly, through my work as a teaching assistant in the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institute for the past two years. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the author emphasizes the crime for which Pontbriant was convicted, the letter to the editor is not about Pontbriant. The letter to the editor cannot be about Pontbriant, because the author does not know anything about him. I was not permitted to read the response in its entirety before it was published, but I strongly suspect that the response is a reflection of a country that stigmatizes people convicted of crimes and denies them any chance of meaningful redemption. This is especially concerning considering that the criminal legal system disproportionately targets people of color and low-income people. The following five points are essential to grasp some of the injustices ingrained within the United States’s treatment of incarcerated people, rebut the unfair claims lodged against Pontbriant and understand Brown’s responsibility to implement the Brown Incarceration Initiative.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First, the dichotomy of victim and criminal is false. As soon as someone is labeled a criminal, we no longer view them as a whole person who too has suffered and has likely been victim to both interpersonal and systemic harm. As Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, says in his TedTalk,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Each of us is more than the worst thing we’ve ever done.” We ought to shift our mentality to one of restorative justice, which focuses on healing the community, not to justify acts of violence, but to actually address and prevent them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Second, we cannot solely talk about non-violent offenders. Most of the conversation surrounding decarceration focuses on non-violent drug offenders, as it is easier to sympathize with such people. However, this reformist logic is flawed. Nobody should be defined as “violent” for the rest of their life without any room for transformation. We, as a society, must address the root causes of harm and not simply the individual manifestations of oppressive systems. Further, 84 percent of incarcerated people are in state prisons and more than half were incarcerated for violent crimes. In order to meaningfully address mass incarceration, we must expand our focus to people incarcerated for violent crimes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Third, the U.S. legal system prescribes incarceration, not the deprivation of education, as the punishment for crime. My personal politics are those of prison abolition, which is defined by <a href="http://criticalresistance.org/about/not-so-common-language/">Critical Resistance</a> as “a political vision with the goal of eliminating imprisonment, policing, and surveillance and creating lasting alternatives to punishment and imprisonment.” I believe the prison-industrial complex was not built to be a system for rehabilitation, but a for-profit system of exploitation, domination and racial control (see Michelle Alexander’s “The New Jim Crow” and Ava Duvernay’s “13th”). Thus, I make the following point in an attempt to engage the argument of the letter writer. The U.S. criminal legal system claims that imprisonment is a tool for rehabilitation. Central to rehabilitation is education. In addition, according to the National Reentry Resource Center, 95 percent of people incarcerated in state prisons will be released. Therefore, prison education programs benefit all community members, as they help incarcerated people fight some of the barriers to reentry to society. Education is known to decrease recidivism rates, which saves tax dollars. A study by the RAND Corporation found that incarcerated people who participated in education programs in prison were 43 percent less likely to return to prison than those who did not.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fourth, education is a human right. As a University that values the “transformative power of education,” Brown must defend education as a human right. University classes can help students develop their critical-thinking and practical skills, which act as a source of empowerment both in prison and after release. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fifth, the University has the support, the resources and the responsibility to implement a for-credit college-in-prison program. There is an identified need for more college classes at the ACI, and the University has the financial resources and student and faculty support to respond. Both in its mission statement and in the 2006 Slavery and Justice report, the University asserts its commitment to communities outside of Brown. A University for-credit college-in-prison program is not simply community service. It would be an opportunity for the University to fulfill a responsibility as one of the largest institutions in Rhode Island and as an institution that claims to be dedicated to diversity and inclusion. Built by enslaved labor and with money from the transatlantic slave trade, the University must act on its stated commitment to “expand opportunities at Brown for those disadvantaged by the legacies of slavery and the slave trade,” as the Corporation’s 2007 response to the Slavery and Justice states. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If one reads Pontbriant’s article carefully, it is clear that the length of his sentence and the crime for which he was convicted are completely irrelevant in the context of prison education. He does not hide his past, but instead acknowledges that he was convicted for a “serious crime,” and then thoughtfully articulates the power of education as a tool for transformation. Pontbriant shares how education helped him regain his self-worth. It is this appreciation and passion for education that made Pontbriant such a wonderful student. Pontbriant exhibited intellectual curiosity and passion for learning, dedicating himself to his studies, asking questions and seeking out extra work. I have attended competitive private schools my whole life and I can confidently say that the classes I have attended in the prison have been some of the most intellectually rigorous, thought-provoking and fulfilling educational environments that I have experienced. The students display a deep respect and gratitude for the opportunity to learn, which is a refreshing change from the entitlement I have often seen on Brown’s campus. So, yes, I believe these students are worthy of Brown University credit — a credit that many students have access to, not due to merit or “worthiness,” but to privilege. In honor of the transformative power of education, I ask the author of the response to read Pontbriant’s article again and to truly listen to what he is saying. Focused on delegitimizing Pontbriant’s argument by centering his crime, the author has failed to hear him. So, I end by repeating Pontbriant’s words about the need for a Brown Incarceration Initiative: “An opportunity to shed the stigma and stereotypes associated with incarceration, a chance to prove to society as well as to ourselves that, if we are provided the means, not only will we succeed but we will flourish — well, that would be invaluable!”</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/16/soria-19-need-student-coalition-fair-ethical-housing/">Sept. 16 op-ed</a>, José Soria ’19 called for “the creation of an undergraduate and graduate student coalition that can help protect the rights of students as tenants with their respective landlords.” As members of Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere, the student-run housing and homelessness organization, we were pleased to see Soria help begin an important conversation about housing in Providence. Soria hit the nail on the head with his observations — Providence rents are too damn high, landlords can be greedy and no one in a position of power looks out for renters, leaving them to fend for themselves in an unforgiving market. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As students ourselves, we know that Soria’s proposal makes complete sense. But as individuals who, through HOPE’s combination of direct service and advocacy work, engage with folks experiencing homelessness every week, we believe that expending energy on such a coalition is a misallocation of limited resources, effort and time. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Providence — like so many cities in this country<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— is in the midst of a massive housing crisis. Soria observed that the rent he pays is three to four times what online resources suggest it ought to be — an experience familiar to many students. Undoubtedly, greedy landlords hoping to take advantage of students are a part of this. But to come to a more complete conclusion about why rent in Providence is so high, we, as Brown students, have to look past the Van Wickle gates; for this is not a problem that only impacts us. In fact, to a certain extent, it is a problem for which we share part of the blame. According to HousingWorks RI’s <a href="https://www.housingworksri.org/Portals/0/Uploads/Documents/2017_Housing%20Fact%20Book.pdf">2017 Fact Book</a>, “more than one in two renters in Rhode Island are housing cost-burdened, meaning they are spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing.” At the lowest end of the income scale, this figure jumps to a frighteningly high seven in ten renters.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why is the rent so high? There are many reasons. For one thing, Providence, unlike many of its regional neighbors, lacks any legislation that would limit or “stabilize” how much landlords can increase the rent from year to year. Additionally, in Rhode Island, it is perfectly legal for landlords to deny potential renters who use government-issued housing assistance. But there’s also the simple fact that Rhode Island has failed, and continues to fail, to invest in affordable housing. While neighbors like Massachusetts and Connecticut annually spend $99.72 and $76.98 per capita, respectively, on affordable housing, Rhode Island spent just $8.46 in 2016. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Still, this framing of the housing crisis excludes an integral piece of the problem: Brown University. Over the past several decades, Brown’s increasing physical and societal footprint in Providence has dramatically reshaped much of the East Side. Not long ago, for instance, a thriving Cape Verdean population lived in Fox Point, but with the expanding demand of housing from Brown students and faculty, and consequent rise in property value, little remains of this community. Many a time, while on Nighttime Outreach, we have often heard older folks talk about how they once called the East Side home, before the rise of Brown and the Rhode Island School of Design forced them out. Granted, the actions that resulted in these displacements happened long before the current cohort of students arrived in Providence, but the fact remains that we are part of an institution that significantly impacts the Providence housing market, and not necessarily in a positive way for the community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">When we, as Brown students, talk about housing, we often have the luxury of framing our conversation in terms of Keeney Quadrangle versus Pembroke or on-campus versus off-campus. But the reality for far too many of our neighbors is much starker. None of this is to say that the University shouldn’t reevaluate its own housing policies, as Soria suggests. It’s without question that these prices are far too high and that they place a tremendous burden on many of our students and their families. However, as residents of a state deeply entrapped in a housing crisis, we should be critical about how we frame our housing conversations on College Hill and beyond. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">When we consider ways to address these problems, solving them from the comfort of our campus will not suffice, for any effort taken solely by the University will fall short of addressing the roots of the problem. Instead of exclusively looking out for our own self-interests, HOPE believes that Brown students should look for ways in which we can throw our tremendous weight — a product of both our privilege and the virtues and skills that helped us get into this school — behind efforts that support community organizations who have engaged in this work for decades and will continue to do so, long after many of us leave Rhode Island. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Twenty-four million dollars later, and the building formerly known as Wilson Hall has completed its transformation into the sleek, modern, fully accessible <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/04/friedmans-donate-24-million-renovate-rename-wilson-hall/">Friedman Hall</a>. This is a welcome change, coming to fruition almost three years after students in PHP 1680I: “Pathology to Power: Disability, Health and Community” drew attention to the challenges faced by students with limited mobility when trying to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/12/04/kill-wilson-demonstrates-wilsons-poor-accessibility/">access it</a>. But this is just the first step necessary to making Brown a fully accessible campus. Going forward, I urge the administration to prioritize renovations of residential halls to build a more inclusive community.</span></p>
<p class="p2">It’s hard to overexaggerate the inaccessibility of student living spaces on Brown’s campus. Of the 58 dorms listed on the official <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/housing-and-dining/residential-life/index.php?q=living-campus/residence-hall-map">Residence Hall Map</a>, 26 receive scores of “0” on the Campus Accessibility Map provided by Facilities Management: 111 Brown St.; 219 Bowen St. (Donovan House); Grad Center A-D; Hegeman A-E; Hope College; King House; Littlefield Hall; Minden Hall; New Pembroke 1-4; North, Middle and South Caswell; Slater Hall; West House; and Young Orchard 4 and 10. This means that in all of those buildings, “a physical barrier exists that would prevent a wheelchair user from entering the facility.” Some, like Minden, might have elevators once you make it inside, or, like Hegeman E, will have wheelchair-accessible bathrooms if you can somehow make it to the second floor with no entrance ramp or elevator. But they all fail the basic test of allowing people with limited mobility to easily get inside. Based on the rooms listed in <span class="s2">the 2015-2016 <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Residential_Council/lottery/results/">housing lottery</a>, at least 1,175 students are living in these spaces. That’s approximately <a href="https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/content/how-big-student-">18 percent</a> of Brown’s undergraduate population ­— and the percentage only gets higher if you are specifically looking at undergraduates living on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It is also worth noting that of the residential halls listed above, only one of the New Pembroke buildings is (sometimes) set aside as first-year housing. Past writers (myself included) have argued that first-year housing options are of considerably higher quality than their sophomore and upperclassmen counterparts. As Samantha Savello ’18 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/22/savello-18-reslife-fails-upperclassmen/">pointed out</a>, “Intuitively, it would seem that Brown’s primary motivation for focusing on first-year housing at the expense of other facilities is to boost its retention rates, which are an important metric for college rankings and reputation. Firs</span><span class="s1">t-year students are less <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/housing-and-dining/residential-life/living-campus/residence-hall-map/university-accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attached</a> to the University and more likely to transfer out if they have bad experiences, including with unaccomodating or deteriorating rooms. As such, the University has done its best to make these first-year havens as comfortable as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When you’re talking about things like peeling paint or the occasional rodent problem, these can be dismissed as small-scale complaints. But in this case, this isn’t just a matter of comfort. This is a matter of being able to be a member of the community: to go to events held in residential halls, to visit your friends or to bring your friends to your space, to navigate through all floors of your building to meet your community. When it seems like something as vital as accessibility is prioritized more in first-year dorms than all others, then Brown’s housing priorities turn from mildly annoying to shameful. Upperclassmen with disabilities are as deserving as first-year students of having a wide range of housing opportunities, especially since off-campus options are even less likely to be fitted with ramps, elevators, and other necessary accommodations.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The construction that would be required to raise the accessibility scores of dorms would not be cheap or quick. But this is not an excuse for inaction. The University Accessibility page on the Residential Life <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/housing-and-dining/residential-life/living-campus/residence-hall-map/university-accessibility">website</a> itself acknowledges the problem, albeit in an understated way, when it says,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Although some of … the improvements remain to be completed, we want to report to the community on the substantial progress that has been made in completing projects that improve the infrastructure of housing for students with disabilities.” It is of course expected that an official University website would emphasize Brown’s accomplishments, and there certainly have been improvements. But fixing some spaces in order to offer a limited array of options to students with disabilities is simply not enough, especially considering that previously able-bodied students may become injured and therefore unable to easily access their rooms. Wider options are needed.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown’s residential halls may meet the minimum standards set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act for accessible dormitories — which <a href="http://thesciongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Scion-ADA-FHA-whitepaper.pdf">mandates</a> that 5 percent of the bedrooms must be handicap-accessible — but it’s time to seriously ask if that is enough. We should strive to do better than just providing such accommodations as the law requires. All University buildings should be subject to as intense and rigorous criticism as was formerly Wilson Hall — but particularly those buildings that house students and function as such vital centers of social life at Brown.</p>

		<title>Jain &#039;19: Changing the culture of consulting recruitment starts with us</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As</span><span class="s2"> someone who too has wondered if I was a sellout for interviewing (and ultimately accepting) an offer at a consulting firm last fall, I was excited to read the columns written by <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/24/calvelli-19-bcg-ban-consulting-groups/">Aidan Calvelli ’19</a> and <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/24/foster-19-dont-fall-fall-recruiting-trap/">Ruth Foster ’19</a> this week. What Foster in particular objects to is the exploitation of seniors’ uncertainty, a notion no one can disagree with on the surface. I argue that banning or otherwise relying on Brown or consulting firms to change the recruiting process misses the fact that recruiting is a two-way street: Companies provide the demand, but we, the talent, make up the supply. By focusing on one side of the issue tree, we deny agency to the supply side.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Banning or changing how consulting companies recruit is not feasible, and, I argue, not even necessarily desirable. Firstly, Brown can’t afford to — nor should it think it right to — choose for students what careers they should pursue (see <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/26/clark-19-reminder-reality-judge/">Alexa Clark’s ’19 opinion</a> for an incisive analysis of why). Secondly, I applaud consulting firms for making an effort to reach every type of applicant, regardless of concentration, which most industries don’t — I met people with backgrounds in everything from zoology to oceanography this summer who otherwise wouldn’t have discovered a career they find fulfilling. Thirdly, the omnipresent nature of consulting firms is more perception, a function of their extensive marketing and recruiting efforts, than reality. Only 11 percent of Brown graduates last year ended up in consulting — and only a fraction of them end up at the firms that Calvelli or Foster might consider particularly egregious. Finally, Calvelli deplores the fact that the number of graduating seniors entering consulting is higher than the nu</span><span class="s1">mber of “people working in environment and sustainability, community service and development, government and public policy and the arts.” This in fact <i>is</i> primarily a demand problem and not a supply one — consulting may be a more popular entry-level choice, but the majority of consultants leave the industry after two to three years and some enter the exact fields Calvelli extols after having gained the skills and the network to enter them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I do not deny that recruiting in general creates an unhealthy atmosphere of stress around campus. However, the right way to deal with that stress is not by removing these firms from campus but addressing the root cause of seniors’ uncertainty: a lack of knowledge of career options and feelings of insecurity during recruiting. (I know exactly how emotionally draining the latter is as a survivor of junior-year recruiting). Exploitation is an issue when people who would otherwise not be interested in consulting at all feel pressured to go to information sessions and apply to consulting firms. Let’s change the potential supply of consultants to people who don’t feel pressured to pursue consulting if it’s not for them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From my experience, the people who know why they want to enter consulting are the ones who, more often than not, end up with offers. By the time candidates get to the final rounds, they’ve spent a lot of time thinking about why this career would be a good fit. When I accepted an offer last year, they hadn’t exploited what Foster might term my “uncertainty,” but were in fact rewarding my certainty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Instead of banning these firms entirely, let’s change what kind of space we give them in our discussions on campus. Why can’t we take the spirit with which we approach academics and apply it to life after Brown? Why shouldn’t people be allowed to “shop” employers just as they shop classes?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What kinds of jobs we choose and how we talk about them is something we have under our control, as individuals, as friends, as a campus. If we demand more from our employers, if we stand up for ourselves and our skills, and, most of all, if we support each other without judgment, we can change the atmosphere of uncertainty and fear that surrounds the recruiting process. If we amplify other voices, other choices, other decisions, we can change which career paths are the most commonly discussed, and more importantly, socially rewarded. We can circulate information for the more informal recruiting processes: share spreadsheets on exciting non-traditional paths, advise on how to network, invite alums we look up to. Working to create access to the kinds of opportunities we wish we had is what we as Brown students do best.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We may be victims of Friedrich Engels’ “false consciousness,” but we don’t escape that trap by banning a company or even an entire industry. We can create a community, even if it’s limited to College Hill, that can have open conversations about what kinds of work are and aren’t valuable for each of our personal hopes — but that can’t happen by tearing each other’s choices down.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finding a job is a difficult enough process as it is. Let’s not make it harder for one another.</span></p>

		<title>Wu &#039;19: Transfer admission should be need-blind</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/01/wu-19-transfer-admission-need-blind/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 04:37:45 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2003, the University became need-blind for domestic, first-year applicants. This meant that Brown would not consider the wealth of an applicant (or their family) in granting admission. In this, Brown affirmed a core tenet of college admission: No candidate should be favored for coming from a rich family; no candidate should be harmed for coming from a poor one. President Emeritus Ruth Simmons, in developing the proposal, spoke of it as a moral obligation. It is an obligation that Brown has never upheld for transfer or international students. Because the international case involves further complications, I here address only the case of domestic transfer applicants. But I suspect very similar things can be said for international students.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over 1,000 potential transfer students <a href="https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/apply/transfer-applicants">apply to Brown</a> each year through a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/financial-aid/transfer-applicants-fa-policy">need-aware process</a>, which means that the University can consider each applicant’s ability to pay when deciding whether to grant admission. For this reason, many apply without requesting financial aid, thereby promising to foot the sticker price of Brown each year they are here. This year, the total cost of attendance runs to $73,892. Since transfer students who do not apply for financial aid when they apply for admission are barred from ever receiving aid, those transfers are then <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/financial-aid/transfer-applicants-fa-policy">required to meet that cost</a> each year they attend.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those who transfer in as sophomores, they will pay over $220,000 to graduate. That’s about three times the <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/american-net-worth-by-state-metropolitan-4135839">median net worth</a> of an American household. Here’s another way to appreciate that sum: Around 70 percent of Americans could drain their entire bank account, sell their house, sell their car, sell their possessions, sell the literal clothes off their literal backs and <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/releases/2014/cb14-156_net_worth_graphic.pdf">still be unable to afford that.</a></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Such a system flagrantly advantages those who come from families with means, treating unjustly those transfer applicants who must apply for aid if they are to attend Brown at all. This is wrong. University admission should not depend on how much money one’s parents make; by now, we accept that this is a basic tenet for any fair admission scheme. And while fixing this is not a panacea for all that ails college admission today, we can at least take one clear step in the right direction by making transfer admission need-blind.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thus far, I have argued that Brown’s need-aware transfer policies are unjust. But perhaps such wrongs can be tolerated because they provide crucial funding that allows Brown to attract a truly diverse first-year class. With such a view, whatever injustice is dealt to transfer applicants can be justified by the fair treatment of first-year applicants and the opportunities provided to them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This reply suffers from three faults. First, it is empirically unsupported; as of yet, there is no evidence to suggest that Brown requires the tuition payments of transfer students to subsidize its financial aid packages. Second, if this is truly a rationale the University wishes to adopt, it ought to make it publicly known. Would-be transfer applicants have a right to know that this is how Brown views them: as sources of funding for first-years. Third, even if we grant the empirical suppositions needed for this view, the morally right response will simply be to admit fewer students until we can afford to run a fair admission process. In this way, justice can be done to all.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another objector may note that if transfer students are willing to pay the sticker price and Brown can use those funds to, say, promote diversity in higher education, why shouldn’t we adopt such a policy? Everyone stands to benefit.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My reply is that exactly similar considerations will hold for first-year admission. There too, we can set aside a portion of the seats for those who have the means to pay. In fact, we might even be able to rack up more funds as people spend all four years committed to Brown. But in fact, we should not do this. Why? Because it wrongs the applicants. So too for transfer applicants.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I close by addressing a third objection: the University cannot afford such a shift, given our paltry endowment. But here, I suspect the policy does more harm than good. If Brown expects to be financially solvent in the long-run, it must expect alumni to give, on average, more than they received in financial aid. I see no reason why such a supposition should not also hold for transfer applicants. As it stands, transfers who pay full sticker to attend may later find themselves wondering why they should donate to a school that never donated to them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recently, President Christina Paxson P’19 has promoted the “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/20/u-aims-eliminate-undergrad-loans-new-brown-promise-initiative/">Brown Promise</a>,” a commitment to replacing loans with University grants in financial aid packages. Given the recent hubbub surrounding the policy, I find it surprising that University administrators (and fellow students) have not directed more attention to this basic inequity in how Brown decides whom to admit. A policy we abandoned in 2003 lives on for transfer students.</span></p>

		<title>Soria &#039;19: It’s time for a timeline for international need-blind admission</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/12/soria-19-time-timeline-international-need-blind-admission/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Back in 2013, President Christina Paxson P’19 outlined need-blind admission for all undergraduate students as one of her goals in the University’s strategic plan. Five years have passed since then, and both domestic transfer applicants and international students are still excluded from this promise. As stated by Patrick Wu ’19 in his <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/01/wu-19-transfer-admission-need-blind/">Oct. 1 Herald op-ed</a>, President Emerita Ruth Simmons referred to the implementation of need-blind financial aid for all students as a moral obligation. Yet the University has so far failed to extend this moral responsibility to international students. As an international student myself and as someone who has advocated on behalf of the international community in my time here, I consider this an issue that is particularly relevant. If the University is serious about its commitment to ensuring need-blind admission for all students, including international students, it is time to release a public timeline for when the international student community can expect to see these reforms.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The University’s mission statement of serving “the world” requires the implementation of need-blind admission policies for international students, that is, those who are not American citizens. Peer schools like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Amherst College already implement need-blind international admission and commit to meeting 100 percent of every applicant’s demonstrated need. It must be said that Brown does meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need for all applicants, which is a commendable step. But current admission practices privilege a small portion of applicants, undermining Brown’s commitment to increasing diversity and inclusion on campus. Since admission is currently need-aware for international students, the policies in place favor the wealthy and discourage middle- and low-income students from seeking University support to fund their education. For the most part, wealthy international students attend international or American private high schools, which — like Brown — can also be prohibitively expensive for middle- and low-income students. This near-homogeneity in schooling and socioeconomic class limits Brown’s ability to deliver on its promise of fostering a truly diverse international student body. If we take a moment to imagine what an international student body admitted through need-blind policies might look like, it becomes clear that there are perspectives that are currently missing on our campus. For instance, need-blind policies might increase the number and di</span>versity of students from underrepresented geographic regions such as Latin America and Africa.</p>
<p class="p3">That isn’t to say that Brown is solely populated with wealthy internatio<span class="s1">nal students — the University has made strides in the expansion of financial aid available to international students in recent years. But admission policy can still adversely affect students’ time at Brown. Admitted international students also have their college experiences jeopardized by Brown’s need-aware policy, as those who did not apply for financial aid originally cannot be granted aid at any other point in their Brown undergraduate education. That leads to significant financial insecurity for those students. Eventual changes in circumstances, such as unexpected unemployment in students’ families or economic crises that impact their home countries, may compromise their ability to afford Brown. At the very least, if need-blind admission for international students is currently a distant dream, the University should work to allow admitted international students to receive financial assistance from the University if needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When Paxson was approved to a second term in 2017, she did not commit to guaranteeing need-blind admission for international students in the following five years, citing financial constraints, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/03/corporation-grants-president-paxson-second-five-year-term/">previously reported</a>. Implementing need-blind admission for international students will indeed be a hefty financial task, but in many ways the University is in a good position to act now. Brown is currently in the midst of a historic $3 billion fundraising campaign known as <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/10/23/brown-launches-3-billion-comprehensive-campaign/">BrownTogether</a>, which surpassed its halfway point last January. Among other initiatives, the campaign fundraises for key Presidential initiatives like the diversity and inclusion action plans and Brown Promise, the University’s commitment to eliminating loans from undergraduate financial aid packages. A public timeline and an awareness campaign on the scale of the aforementioned initiatives that targets international alums keen to give back to their home countries would help drive fundraising efforts for need-blind international admission, which technically also falls under the campaign’s purview. According to the President’s Financial Report for FY17, “$27 million (has been) raised for undergraduate financial aid to meet increased need throughout the student population (and) Brown’s financial aid budget climbed to more than $120 million for the 2016-17 academic year. This amount encompasses aid for approximately 43 percent of undergraduates, including more than 180 international students.” Think of the impact a public and specific commitment from the University could have on these numbers and the futures of incoming international students. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The University has already taken a moral position on this issue. What it needs now is a plan to execute its vision. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Truth. Respect. Fairness. A climate that supports the free exchange of ideas without fear of harassment or intimidation. These are the University’s values. It is precisely these values that have guided the University’s actions since the August 2016 National Labor Relations Board decision granting graduate students at private colleges and universities who serve as teaching or research assistants the right to decide whether or not to unionize. And so I am deeply concerned to hear members of our community share accounts of being pressured and harassed during a time of important conversation about graduate student unionization.</p>
<p class="p2">Though the University’s primary relationship with graduate students is as students — this is how we admit, recruit and train them — we have been consistent in our compliance with the NLRB ruling and have supported the right of graduate students to make this important decision for themselves. The University student group Stand Up for Graduate Student Employees and the American Federation of Teachers are leading the unionization effort, and we have worked directly with them to advance the goal of student choice and to reduce the polarization that we have seen on other campuses.</p>
<p class="p2">Our values of truth, respect, fairness and free choice have shaped the June 21, 2018 University-Union Conduct Rules Pre-Election Agreement. Among the stipulations in the agreement is a commitment to mutual respect and prohibitions against harassing or intimidating behavior by either University or union representatives. We also created an <a href="https://brown.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_82IyAfjitTetJvD">online form</a> for students to report any incidents of University or union member conduct that may violate these community standards. We want students to feel fully supported and to know the facts as they prepare for a vote.</p>
<p class="p2">Every member of our community has a role in upholding these values, and thus I am disappointed to share that we have received multiple reports from students complaining of harassment by representatives of SUGSE and AFT. The graduate students who wrote complained of union organizers making blatantly false claims and employing tactics of harassment and intimidation. One student wrote to express concerns about “the aggressive approach used by SUGSE representatives to persuade graduate students to vote in favor of unionization,” noting that his fellow students had been “peer-pressured into signing a commitment card and taking a photo of them showing words of support for unionization.” Another wrote that he was “misled by student union representatives and national chapter union representatives this summer; they attempted to misconstrue the contents of a document they had asked me to sign. I was unhappy with the way this was handled and felt tricked.” There were other reports, but those students have not given me permission to share their accounts because they fear reprisal.</p>
<p class="p2">While some of this behavior can be expected over the course of a normal unionization campaign, the whole purpose of our Pre-Election Agreement was to prevent precisely this type of behavior — these violations of our community standards. We have communicated our concerns to SUGSE and AFT and have taken action to exclude from campus one particular AFT organizer whose egregious behavior was reported more than once.</p>
<p class="p2">These tactics by SUGSE and AFT are unnecessary and unacceptable. Graduate students deserve to know the facts as they deliberate whether or not to form a union, and they also deserve the respect to make this important decision free of intimidation and harassment. The University remains committed to doing everything possible to ensure that members of the community, and in particular eligible graduate students, are informed about issues related to graduate student unionization and can discuss and debate these issues openly.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Students are empowered on our campus to take action, and we encourage graduate students to know the details of our faculty conduct guidelines and Pre-Election Agreement, as well as to use the incident report form available on the resources section of the Be Informed website to report any concerns related to University or union member conduct. Let’s all recommit to upholding our shared values as we head toward an election that will determine whether or not graduate students join a union.</span></p>

		<title>Bosis &#039;19: The agency problem in student employment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There has been some serious blowback, to say the least, around Brown Dining Services stemming from the extreme <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/12/students-claim-buds-creates-unfair-working-environment/">overworking of students in supervising and management positions</a>. The problems are myriad: fewer new hires means more work for the rest, existing employees often put off leaving out of fear of hurting their friends still working for BuDS and the organization has no formal structure that guarantees consideration of student policy proposals — the list goes on. But the problem is not simply that pay isn’t high enough to attract more workers, or that overworked students must question whether they are really “students first.” Employers hiring recent graduates frequently look for students with experience in a setting where their decisions directly affect the future of the organization. After all, the overwhelming majority of sample resumes on CareerLAB’s website highlight relevant leadership experiences that can translate into interview and job offers. Few on-campus jobs provide that kind of experience , and as a result, time spent working is time that can’t be spent in a meaningful leadership position. That disadvantage can seriously reduce the qualifications of even the hardest-working students as they seek employment after graduation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">There are certainly valuable skills to be gained from any job on campus, whether it’s serving food, phone banking for alumni donations or manning the welcome desk. But as it stands, these skills are more difficult to translate to a resume than those gained in non-paying, extracurricular organizations. The truth is that anyone not worried about needing money for the immediate continuation of their education has the luxury of pursuing jobs or clubs that look more impressive on their resume, while less privileged students take jobs that pay relatively well but don’t exactly stand out to potential employers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It’s true that student employment is both an accepted form of financial assistance from the University and a valid mode of engagement on campus. But in order for schools like Brown to really offer the same experience to all their students, they must consider how working 20 or more hours a week affects students’ on-paper qualifications. That’s not to mention that dissatisfaction in student employment, like what has been voiced at BuDS, can largely be attributed to the lack of agency and decision-making power. Feeling helpless and even burdened by an employer can significantly damage student wellness over the course of a semester and strip students of the same feelings of empowerment and content that other leadership roles provide and that the University at large works very hard to promote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Some on-campus groups are attempting to tackle this issue in their own ways. For example, I recently learned that The Herald itself is able to provide financial assistance for those who need it, enabling students who would otherwise have to spend their time working an on-campus job to gain leadership experience instead. Of course, since almost no student groups have the same funding network as The Herald, the feasibility of implementing this option more widely is limited. The Computer Science Teaching Assistant program, on the other hand, is one student employer that recognizes the importance of providing the opportunity for autonomy to its members. Not only do TAs, in my personal experience, report more job satisfaction than average student workers, but the skills involved in organizing assignments — even redesigning the introductory sequence of the department — demonstrate much more depth of thought and initiative than those needed for holding disciplinary meetings with BuDS workers who show up late.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"> Brown, as the <a href="http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/es202/largestemp.htm">fourth-largest private employer</a> in the state of Rhode Island, has a definite ability to influence the structure of BuDS and other student employment. One potential test case is Georgetown University, whose equivalent dining organization has student positions at every level of management. By handing over decisions for some of the dining halls on everything from hiring and hours to purchasing and writing policy, the school effectively empowers students who need the work to move up the ladder just as their counterparts in extracurricular groups so often do.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">BuDS may be working to improve the day-to-day working conditions and compensation for the students who keep our dining halls open, but without a significantly more student-centric model of leadership, none of these fundamental issues will be fixed. It is, of course, well within the rights of Dining Services as a organization to dictate its employment structure, but it is the responsibility of a socially conscious university to take steps beyond the bare minimum to empower its students and safeguard their well-being. If anything, building a workplace of employees invested in the organization may ultimately benefit employers and employees alike.</span></p>

		<title>Kent-Daggett &#039;19: City should prioritize low-income residents</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In an <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/15/friedman-19-edge-college-hill-not-perfect-just-pragmatic/">Oct. 15 column</a>, Andrew Friedman ’19 made a simplistic and offensively ahistorical argument for Edge College Hill II — the new luxury student housing development on Canal Street. Positioning himself opposite “multiple prominent local advocacy groups, two city councilors-elect and an incumbent city councilwoman,” Friedman suggested that the new tower is a pragmatic investment for the city because, in his words, “why have less money when you can have more?” Friedman’s analysis doesn’t dredge much deeper than this facile line. In reality, debates about public investment in private real estate developments are worthy of more nuanced consideration beyond the city’s tax ledger, and a serious analysis of wealth and development in Providence illuminates why Edge College Hill II (and projects like it) are, in fact, “morally degenerate.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Wealthy students who can afford to live in Edge College Hill should be the City of Providence’s lowest investment priority. The history of urban planning and development in Providence — and the United States as a whole — is one long story of promoting the comfort of the elite over the most basic well-being and stability of low-income communities and communities of color. After World War II, these communities were pinballed by redlining, urban renewal, “<a href="http://freakonomics.com/2011/09/30/the-controversial-legacy-of-slum-clearance/">slum clearance</a>” and freeway construction — almost always in the name of the public good and all in the span of a single lifetime. Ignoring this history of segregation and displacement is more than naive; it is willfully and negligently ignorant. While one could argue that the City can invest in public and luxury housing, a brief historical survey shows that development in Providence has largely been a zero-sum game. Time and again, desperate city and state officials have subsidized luxury condominiums, out-of-state developers and failed private ventures while <a href="https://www.housingworksri.org/Portals/0/Uploads/Documents/2017_Housing%20Fact%20Book.pdf">half of all Rhode Island renters are cost-burdened</a>. In practice, public investment in a building like Edge College Hill has negated the possibility of a public housing project or a shelter — basic needs that have been systematically denied or physically destroyed in the communities most in need. In addition, the accompanying $19 million tax stabilization agreement means that the development does not contribute to public programs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The straightforward finances tell a similar story: According to the New York Times, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html">median family income of Brown’s student body was $204,000</a>. In comparison, Providence’s median family income is $43,000. Housing is deemed affordable if it comprises no more than 30 percent of a family’s monthly income. For a single person in Providence, affordable means rent no higher than $925 per month — significantly less than a $1,700 studio, $2,200 one-bedroom, $1,350 room in a two-bedroom or $1,085 room in a three-bedroom at 257 Thayer. (Prices were unavailable for Edge College Hill II.) For a Brown student, a median family income of $204,000 means that an apartment at 257 Thayer and a three-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan would be considered affordable. While I don’t pretend to know the financial circumstances of individual students (regardless of their economic background), developments like Edge College Hill cater to the wealthy on college campuses who don’t require state-subsidized housing more than the people of Providence. Why bother introducing “competitive new supply” to an income bracket that doesn’t need any more help? While Friedman argues that “students want a nice place to live that doesn’t break the bank,” Providence residents with objectively higher needs have been demanding the same thing for decades. If the anti-luxury argument were in need of a pithy reduction, it would be this: There is no better public investment than affordable housing. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It is also worth interrogating Friedman’s discussion of Direct Action for Rights and Equality. DARE has been fighting for the rights of poor and working class families, people of color, immigrants, women, youth and LGBTQ+ community members since 1986 and is in the midst of multiple campaigns for fair housing legislation. But Friedman shrugs off the organization’s letter to city officials, citing the political and financial impracticality of rent control and affordable housing. While the city’s history of handouts to wealthy developers is “simply the going rate” of development, any challenge to regressive tax breaks is met with a shrug and a cry of “pragmatism.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">While I do credit Friedman for offering an unabashed defense of rich students’ housing preferences, students would all benefit from heeding the words of local experts and elected officials. That isn’t to say Brown students should never contradict organizations like DARE, but we should give their claims more credit than Friedman’s. For Friedman — who, like most Brown students, might leave Providence after graduation this May — to dismiss DARE as “nearsighted” illustrates a worldview so small-minded as to be preemptively disqualifying from writing about local problems.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ultimately, Friedman’s position is just another manifestation of a much larger problem. As detailed in my <a href="https://www.theindy.org/1482">Sept. 24 article</a> in the College Hill Independent, entire neighborhoods are being remade with the same deference to wealthy residents and their desired amenities. While the merits of Edge College Hill as a publicly subsidized luxury development could be debated endlessly, a more inclusive analysis of Providence real estate and the city’s long history of segregation and displacement under the guise of pragmatism takes the convenient shine off of Friedman’s slick math.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brown sports teams are bad. So bad. Almost no one attends the games. They are no fun to watch. And not in a funny “ha-ha” way, but in a “well, there goes another $17.7 million” kind of way. And yet, every year, we recruit more fencers, build turf baseball stadiums, replace dead equestrian horses and lose, lose, lose. The same thing over and over again, expecting things to change.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You might expect us to say, “Abolish sports!”, but no, there is a sensible middle ground. We say, “Abolish every sport but one!” Specifically, we propose retaining our men’s and women’s basketball teams — the sport that is most socially conscious and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/basketball-and-globalization">fastest-growing</a>, with the highest profile women’s league in the United States. We admit this might sound radical to athletic centrists, but even a special committee convened by President Emeritus Ruth Simmons in 2011 suggested Brown <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/sports/brown-to-cut-three-intercollegiate-sports">cut its more auxiliary sports teams</a> such as women’s skiing and both fencing programs — sports that still remain in our budget. The numbers check out. If we allocate nearly $9 million to both the men’s and women’s basketball teams, we would have, by far, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2012/03/29/when-its-okay-to-lose-money-the-business-of-womens-college-basketball/#758bc0cb38b5">best-endowed women’s program</a> and a top-15 men’s program. With a budget of this size, we could hire top-notch coaches, criss-cross the world recruiting the best high school players and develop the Pizzitola into an arena suitable for elite talent. To pay for a renovation of the Pizzitola and other upfront costs, we simply sell the land we no longer need, namely the Brown Stadium, Meehan Auditorium and the riverfront boathouse property, which together will go for tens of millions of dollars. Add to that the profit from the sales of our incredible variety of now-unnecessary athletic equipment (helmets, pads, cupping therapy equipment, horses, sailboats, skate sharpeners, fencing foils and golf tees, to name a few), which could all be sold to other schools or melted down for ore.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In all seriousness, we believe that concentrating the school’s athletic budget and energy into two top-notch basketball programs would provide a more fun and rewarding experience for athletes and fans. Women’s and men’s basketball are Brown’s best bet in terms of high-profile success in a Big-4 sport (basketball, football, ice hockey and baseball/softball). But why should the school even bother building a top-ranked team, regardless of sport? Why not scrap all athletics and add $17.7 million to the University’s annual Payment In Lieu of Taxes to the City of Providence? Because the Brown Athletics mission statement is correct in its claim that sports can unite a community, bring pride to campus and teach teamwork, perseverance and sacrifice. Basketball is Brown’s best option to achieve these goals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given the small size of a basketball roster, a basketball-only strategy would do away with the vast majority of athletic admissions. A 2014 Herald poll found that a majority of undergraduate students were against the University designating acceptance spots for athletes. This small team size also means that a few big-name recruits could carry the team deep into the March Madness tournament, garnering significant media attention and revenue. There would also be more room on one half of the Verney-Woolley Dining Hall and more housing available on Lloyd Street. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The alternative sports are easily dismissed. Football? Concussions. Lacrosse? Can’t see the ball. Hockey? Too cold. Swimming? Underwater. Ski team? Global warming. Golf? Not a sport. But hoops? Fast, indoors, slam dunks, jumbotrons. The seats are close to the field of play, players aren’t hidden behind pads or helmets and the school is not complicit in the destruction of its students’ brains. Plus, with only one sports game per week, a true fan base could amass in support of Brown teams, fostering community and spirit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can foresee this idea receiving pushback from those who contribute to some of our more successful sports. For example, our women’s crew and men’s lacrosse teams are quite good. Congrats, but these wins bring little, if any, value to the broader Brown community. Others may argue that a wide variety of athletic disciplines provides opportunities to gain lessons in teamwork and perseverance. But so do 18 years of pre-college athletics, club sports, intramurals, school newspapers, theatre performances and most other things in life. Or what about the fact that sports are fun to play? We agree. Catch us repping the College Hill Independent at intramural volleyball Thursdays in the Olney-Margolies Athletic Center. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Likewise, some will point to studies that athletes donate more money to their universities. While we can find no evidence that this is true at Brown, a strong basketball culture might provide similar effects, if they do occur. And finally, some may claim that we cannot build a basketball program overnight that can compete on the national level. But given the low bar in the Ivy League, even a decent team can consistently win its guaranteed NCAA tournament spot. That spot, combined with national attention, campus-wide renovations, celebrity status for the ten athletes on campus, Brown’s general reputation of academic excellence and Providence’s exemplary food culture would attract many top recruits. Sure, it might be tough to convince top high school athletes to come to Brown initially, but we would only need a few.</span></p>

		<title>Toledano &#039;20: Kennedy plaza should focus on the public experience</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I like to think of Kennedy Plaza as the “heart” of Rhode Island. Designer Don Powers would call it “the living room” of the Ocean State, or what I would call the yellow submarine of the octopus’ garden. Recent discussion about the planned renovations to Kennedy Plaza has me thinking about its fate. Currently, as Bonnie Nickerson, director of the Department of Planning and Development for the City of Providence, explained, the plan for Kennedy Plaza is to consolidate bus stops, improve pedestrian safety, improve vehicle circulation and “create a vibrant public space.” </span></p>
<p class="p2">As of now, Kennedy Plaza works for the machine; its primary purpose, in effect, is to serve the cars and buses. And those cars and buses are not nice: They’re loud, they’re ugly and most of all they can be <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160824/cumberland-woman-struck-killed-by-bus-in-providences-kennedy-plaza">dangerous</a>. Providence’s current plan for Kennedy Plaza, funded by the state and the city, is a welcome first step, but I think it could go further.</p>
<p class="p2">I believe Kennedy Plaza needs to become a more meaningful space for people, not just buses. This space belongs to the residents of the city and should provide a wonderful experience to everyone who visits. The idea of a city plaza, from Florence to León to New York, is to provide a space that’s appealing for everybody. Imagine coffee tables spilling out into Westminster Street, children playing jump rope, young couples holding hands and ice skating. There’s magic to be had; the difficulty is allocating funds to anything besides infrastructure and transportation plans.</p>
<p class="p2">Renovation plans have come to fruition, and construction will begin in 2019 for moving the buses to Washington Street. There will no longer be stops on Exchange Terrace, East Approach or Fulton Street. This should make the plaza safer for pedestrians, a welcome first step, but the next step would be making it fun and conducive to recreational use.</p>
<p class="p2">For me, a caffeine junkie with a lust for Paris lights, Kennedy Plaza’s appeal to leisure would definitely involve a coffee shop and maybe a rose garden and a fountain shaped like Apollo. However, the current plan is intentionally vague, with only a specific mention to “public art.” Kennedy Plaza will be a nice space, and the city wants to make it happen, but at the moment, for reasons that make a lot of sense, pragmatism rules and beauty takes a backseat in the unraveling of this plan.</p>
<p class="p2">Now, it’s worth noting that any plan to improve a city comes at a cost — gentrification.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Typically, this involves displacing citizens due to increased property values and rents. The thing about Kennedy Plaza, however, is that it’s not currently a residential area. While retail values might go up, the cost of living should not change significantly. Creating a public space that welcomes everyone and enables everyone to come together to have a positive experience can facilitate social equality and improved community experience when done cautiously and thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="p2">Look at public spaces in countries around the world. Places that come to mind are Denmark and Colombia. The Copenhagen-based landscape architecture, real estate and planning group <a href="https://gehlpeople.com/story/">Gehl’s</a> projects in Denmark and around the world use innovative concepts like gardens and children’s education as a foundation for improving urban quality of life.</p>
<p class="p2">In Colombia, the city of Medellin provides an interesting and important example of urban design and infrastructure as an attempt at improving socioeconomic equity. Over the past 10 years, former Mayor Sergio Fajardo led a project in what the city of Medellin terms “<a href="https://gehlpeople.com/story/">social urbanism</a>.” By improving services, public spaces and transportation systems, the city reinvented itself. Once an overpopulated hub for crime and inequity, the city has made huge steps for the advancement of quality of life for its fast-growing population.</p>
<p class="p2">The city’s experimental plan created environmentally friendly improvements like a garden that absorbs toxins from a major landfill, a “greenbelt” walking/biking path to curb urban sprawl and transportation that promotes access for everybody to medical care and work. This project, which earned Medellin the Urban Land Institute’s award for “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-21638308">most innovative city</a>,” has its downside. In the completion of the project, people were displaced from their homes — a result of change in residential areas. Violence still remains a serious problem in the city, and the new designs replaced some of the original charm many of its citizens held dear.</p>
<p class="p2">Maintenance, and continued improvement, are integral to the <a href="https://qz.com/1381146/slums-are-growing-around-the-world-but-a-city-in-colombia-has-a-solution/">success</a> of a project on this scale. Still, it’s important to note how much public safety and experience have both improved: Murder rates are lower than they have been, educational initiatives have improved and art galleries, libraries and public spaces now flourish.</p>
<p class="p2">While there are no guarantees, the people behind the project in Kennedy Plaza are trying to design a public space for the public’s use. A truly successful public space would also be for the public’s benefit.</p>
<p class="p2">For now, however, Kennedy Plaza improvements have to keep safety as their primary concern, and that’s simply working toward a basic quality of life issue for Providence citizens. Maybe, over the next five years or so, Kennedy Plaza will become a heart for the people of Rhode Island, but for now it’s still just arteries and veins getting buses from one place to another. Call me a dreamer, but next time I’m at Haven Bros doing damage to my own heart, I’ll be thinking of how, one day, Kennedy Plaza too might become a heart with a pulse in the city of Providence.</p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">With the start of the new week came the revival of an old debate: Is there value in Brown athletics? Many of us arrived to work last Monday to find multiple messages from friends sharing the opinion piece by August ’19, Kent-Daggett ’19 and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Taswell ’19 entitled, “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/21/august-19-kent-daggett-19-taswell-19-slam-dunk-proposal-brown-athletics/">A slam dunk proposal for Brown athletics</a>.” We will be blunt: It’s disappointing to see the disrespect that some Brown students show their peers who play sports.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are still unconvinced that the op-ed we are responding to was 100 percent earnest. It may only be a half-serious and half-provocative piece, but it is certainly a half-baked take intended to revitalize the longstanding debate on the value of Brown athletics. We doubt even the basketball teams at Brown, who have earned a specific amount of respect and admiration from the authors, would support the plan to make the “Brown Athletic Department” the “Brown Basketball Department.” Our belief is that we need to nip this anti-athlete sentiment in the bud, as it is breeding an impression among student-athletes that the general student body finds their attendance at Brown to be undeserved, or even worse, fraudulent. Lest we forget, students at Brown would not be able to call themselves “Ivy Leaguers” without Brown’s financial contributions and student-athletes’ time commitment to Ivy athletics. The Ivy League is, first and foremost, an athletic conference — built on student-athletes’ efforts in practice and competition — that provides the student body social and professional prestige.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is not written to criticize The Herald for publishing this piece, but to address the fact that fellow alums, current students and casual readers (as exemplified by comments on the op-ed) could not tell if the article was serious or if it was meant for the Brown Noser. It is disappointing to see three students attack members of 36 athletic teams in the belief that, in short, basketball is better than other sports and people like it more. Their op-ed dismisses out of hand the perspectives of student-athletes, who have each spent thousands of hours mastering their sport to compete at the highest levels of the NCAA, by simply stating, “Brown sports teams are bad. So bad.” (Incidentally, one of the authors of this piece, Tommy, was a multiple-time NCAA qualifier who finished Top 16 at NCAAs in swimming and went on to train and compete professionally with Michael Phelps post-graduation.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Student-athletes represent nearly 13 percent of Brown students. We invite you to imagine a situation in which one student (or group of students) wrote an article criticizing a large swath of students without any pushback. Were someone to write about cutting Brown’s theater program because not every theater major becomes a Broadway star or Hollywood actor, the condemnation would be swift and powerful. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We readily admit $17.7 million is not a trivial amount of money. However, one can see after looking into the University’s annual expenditures that the athletic budget is a drop in the bucket compared to the billions spent on other equally worthy items. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">$17.7 million is 56 percent of the sum that the University spent on Development and Alumni Relations in 2017-18 (there was no publicly available line-item budget for athletics published in 2018-19). That is, the University spends almost twice as much money trying to recruit alumni to give them more money than they do on current student-athletes. Graduate student support ($107.9 million) is over six times higher than Brown’s expenditures for athletics. The facts lay out the reality that Brown expends six times more on graduate students, who may stay for as little as one year, than athletes who typically stay for at least four years. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The value of athletics on campus, however, goes beyond the University’s ledgers. As written before, there are communal effects that sports, no matter their level of success, provide a community and city. Hockey and football games are frequently attended by Providence locals who have no connection to the University besides being woken up by students on Saturday nights. Are children from East Providence less inspired by the lacrosse abilities of <a href="http://www.floridalaunchlacrosse.com/players/dylan-molloy">Dylan Molloy ’17</a> than that of their favorite MLL player? Does hosting several NCAA-level tournament events not help the University recoup at least some of the $17.7 million spent to provide the opportunity for community in a University?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another economics lesson: $17.7 million for athletics is an investment in the alumni network that Brown develops through its athletic program — and the returns are tangible. Last year, Tom McMullen ’62, a former varsity swimmer, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BrownUFootball/posts/thank-you-to-tom-mcmullen-62-for-your-generosity-to-and-support-of-brown-athleti/10155806911423843/">donated $5 million to the University</a> as part of the BrownTogether fundraising campaign. Athletes who go into finance on Wall Street, become doctors, shape politics, make music and beyond are willing and dedicated to a university that provided them the opportunity to attend and compete for an Ivy League school. Less than a week ago, David Given ’75 <a href="https://brownbears.com/news/2018/10/24/mens-ice-hockey-brown-university-athletics-receives-largest-ever-coaching-endowment-gift.aspx">donated $3 million</a> to endow the men’s ice hockey coaching position, stating, “I am deeply grateful for the experience that I enjoyed as a hockey player at Brown, both as a student and as an athlete. My objective with this endowment is to foster similar experiences for young men who love hockey and want an incredible college education.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the least appreciated aspects of sports is the opportunities they provide to students who may come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Not every student-athlete comes from a family with a history of college education and professional schooling. The NCAA publicizes that 16 percent of student-athletes are first generation, and only 47 percent of these student-athletes strongly agreed they would have attended a four-year college had they not been an athlete. Of course, these statistics are not necessarily representative of Brown’s student-athlete population, but athletic recruitment could still be a valuable avenue for first-generation and low-income students. Athletic and academic gifts combined make the University accessible.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I would hope that 34-time participants in intramural sports and three-time intramural champions would see the benefits that sports can provide not only to oneself, but also to the Brown community and society at large. While the ultimate goal of all sports teams (especially at the NCAA Division I level) is winning, there are character-building traits, teamwork skills and other benefits achieved along the way. These values are embodied by the refrain, “It’s about the journey, not the destination.” The lessons learned from athletics are similar to those of any activity that builds work ethic, discipline and camaraderie: Successes are often attributed to hard work and failures can be overcome with persistence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Student-athletes are just like students at Brown — the only difference is that the extracurriculars we participate in are varsity sports rather than intramurals, music, theater or other activities. Some appreciation for the time, effort and passion with which student-athletes represent the University would go a long way to healing this seemingly growing chasm between those who compete in sports and those who do not.

		<title>Bouton &#039;20: We must demand a fossil fuel-free DNC</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In June, the Democratic National Committee ended its long-standing policy of accepting money from the fossil fuel industry. But in August, a resolution put forth by party Chairman Tom Perez ’83 P’18 reversed the June decision. As Clare Steinman ’19 wrote in a column back in September, Perez’s decision was a disappointing reversal that signaled the DNC’s willingness to turn a blind eye to fossil fuel executives’ use of political donations and lobbying to deliberately spread misinformation about climate science.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The DNC’s lack of leadership on this issue is particularly concerning in light of a report released earlier this month by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that informed policymakers of the urgent need to pursue far-reaching systemic transformations and reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. The impacts of failing to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius range from worsening food shortages and hurricanes to drastic sea level rises, all of which will harm poor communities and historically marginalized groups first and worst. To avoid the catastrophic and profoundly unjust effects of climate change, the report suggests that governments transform the global economy by putting a price on carbon that accurately accounts for its social and environmental destruction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This type of rapid socioeconomic transformation can seem unforeseeable in the current U.S. political climate, especially as the party purportedly committed to fighting climate change remains open to accepting contributions from oil, gas and coal executives who are enabling the problem. So why has the DNC lost its resolve to reject the corrupting influence of fossil fuel money? The answer lies in the longstanding myth about the division between two of the Democratic Party’s core constituencies: labor and environmentalists.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The second resolution passed in August states that the party “support(s) fossil fuel workers” and therefore will accept donations from “unions’ or employers’ political action committees.” However, this phrasing permits a loophole through which highly-paid executives of fossil fuel companies can fund the DNC through these PACs. In contrast, the original resolution, for which Perez and the rest of the DNC voted unanimously in June, barred donations from oil, gas and coal company PACs and instead allowed workers in these industries to make donations on an individual basis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perez has justified the DNC’s decision to accept fossil fuel money by arguing that the Democratic Party should be an advocate for labor. During a conference call following the passage of the second resolution, Perez said: “We have to draw the line that we are indeed a party of a big tent where all working people are welcome. We’re not a party that punishes workers simply based on how they make ends meet.” But, he said, the DNC would simultaneously remain committed to its “platform, which states unequivocally our support for combating climate change.” The subtext of Perez’s statements, though, is a supposed tension between the labor and environmentalist movements. Perez seems to give in to the fossil fuel industry’s narrative that policymakers cannot embrace the cause of workers and climate action at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But, in fact, labor advocates and environmentalists, two constituencies that fossil fuel executives have historically worked to pit against each other, have a common interest in creating good jobs that protect both people and the planet. Climate change presents a promising opportunity for labor and climate activists to come together and demand a just transition to renewable energy involving the large-scale creation of new green jobs. For instance, the IPCC report suggests that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require an average annual investment of $2.4 trillion, or 2.5 percent of the world’s GDP, between now and 2035. This has the potential to create an incredible number of high-quality jobs in what has been conceived as a “Green New Deal.” But this collaboration and progress will be impossible if the Democratic Party leadership continues to seek financial support from fossil fuel executives and block initiatives that would be detrimental to their profits, which clearly includes the transition to renewable energy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the DNC has received no money from the fossil fuel industry since the original resolution was passed back in June, the energy and natural resources sector — which includes fossil fuel producers and mining companies — donated $2.6 million to the DNC in 2016. The sector continues to make substantial contributions to Democratic candidates, who receive donations separately from the DNC, but nevertheless supposedly share many values.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Going into the 2020 elections, a “Green New Deal” should be a core priority of the Democratic Party. It is an outstanding opportunity to draw labor and climate activists together and set the United States on a path for the type of transformation necessary to fight climate change. But this type of visionary action will not be possible if the DNC remains open to the corrupting influence of fossil fuel money. The DNC must send a clear signal that it will not prioritize the profits of oil, gas and coal executives over the future of our planet any longer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sunrise RI, a chapter of the national Sunrise Movement, which is a youth-led movement to stop climate change and create millions of good jobs in the process, has been organizing a campaign on campus and across the country to pressure the DNC to stop accepting donations from fossil fuel executives. After the second resolution was passed back in August, Sunrisers traveled to Chicago to disrupt the DNC summer meeting and deliver a petition with over 100,000 signatures calling on the DNC to refuse fossil fuel PAC money. Across the country, Sunrise and other progressive partner organizations have also gotten over 1,250 candidates and elected officials running at all levels of government to sign a No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge. On campus, Sunrise RI has been speaking with Perez on a regular basis and circulating a petition for students to urge him to commit the DNC to being fossil fuel free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As young voters, we must demand that our political leaders champion the visionary change necessary to ensure a more equitable and livable world. This must start with refusing to accept the toxic influence of fossil fuel executives and the false divide between labor and climate activists.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Emma Bouton ’20 is a member of Sunrise RI and can be reached at emma_bouton@brown.edu. Please send responses to this opinion to letters@browndailyherald.com and other op-eds to opinions@browndailyherald.com.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Meszaros GS: The hidden costs of immunizations</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/30/meszaros-gs-hidden-costs-immunizations/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I got my flu shot last week. The whole process was fast, convenient and entirely free — in fact, the most difficult part for a brand new student was finding the basement lounge where the shots were being administered. Encouraging the student body to inoculate against the onset of flu season is an admirable goal, but the ease of this process stood in stark contrast to my other experience with vaccinations at Brown. Rather, registering the rest of my existing immunizations with the University was disorganized, complex and costly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown, and the state of Rhode Island, <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/health/services/injections-and-immunizations">require a set of immunizations</a> of all incoming students, graduate and undergraduate alike. Despite this standard, the process of proving compliance with this requirement is expensive, outdated and not fully communicated to students. This poses problems and potential barriers to entry for students — the costs associated with proving compliance can be significant in medical bills but also in time off from work and transportation. Worse than the substantial cost of this part of the onboarding process is the fact that alternatives exist that are not communicated to students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I’d like to illustrate with my own experience. The immunization record form required by the University must be filled out and signed by a physician or medical provider. Before any doctor would sign my form, they required an intake physical. Because I was interning out-of-state, none of these non-emergency medical procedures were covered under my health insurance, meaning that I was paying entirely out-of-pocket for a physical, lab work, transportation and missed internship work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Incoming students are informed that immunization records are due by July 1 the summer before they arrive. It was mid-way through June and I was more than $500 in debt from the process when I realized that I still needed a second dose of the varicella vaccine — the chicken pox shot — which would add close to another $200 to my debt. I was not in compliance and didn’t have the money to afford the final vaccination. Even though my graduate program at Brown has provided a sizable stipend, covering my tuition and health insurance, I wasn’t going to be able to afford to even get to Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Out of desperation, I emailed Health Services to see if there was any sort of fellowship or scholarship they could provide to cover medical expenses necessary to get to Brown. I was informed by the nursing staff that I could ignore the July 1 deadline, come to Brown not in compliance and get my final vaccination covered by my insurance from Health Services.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The cost of preparing my immunization record was nearly prohibitive, only affordable because it turns out I didn’t need it. I came to Brown while not in compliance, got my health insurance here, then received my final varicella vaccination for free. If this option had been communicated to me, I would have saved a substantial amount of money. Five hundred dollars may not seem like much, but it was the difference between paid and unpaid credit card bills and determined whether I could buy any of my textbooks at the beginning of the semester.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So how do we fix this? Accept more forms of vaccination verification rather than just the established form; records faxed from doctor’s offices should be sufficient. Regardless of whether health staff here evaluate them and determine compliance, or whether a different doctor fulfills the same task, the result is the same. An increase in communication is imperative as well — is it okay to come to Brown while non-compliant? Let your students know. And affording immunization records isn’t the only onboarding cost awaiting new students — their future holds internet setup costs, textbook rentals and, in the case of graduate students like me, trying to afford food when stipend payouts don’t come until the end of the first month.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finding ways to enable students to have power over these personal matters is critical, especially when we’re talking about health and barriers to entry. Even with good funding and covered health care, the cost of entrance into school can be prohibitive, and the way to make it possible could just be a matter of actively sharing information with students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Vaccinations are important, and they should be required. To that end, Brown should make it as easy as possible to ensure that its student body is protected. And that doesn’t always mean coming in with a signed immunization form. Because while my situation may have been unique, every student who comes here faces their own, often pricey, obstacles. Awareness of these hidden costs, and steps to mitigate them, will ultimately ensure a healthier and more accessible campus environment.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We first want to commend Glenn ’14, Meyers ’16, Johnston ’17 and Matsumoto ’16 for their Herald op-ed “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/29/glenn-14-meyers-16-cutting-brown-athletics-isnt-joke/">Cutting Brown athletics isn’t a joke</a>.” As former Brown student-athletes, they highlight the intricacies of the recurring debate on whether or not Brown athletics add value to the community. As current student-athletes, we fully support the article and want to build on it from our own perspectives.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While we play for our love of our sport, we also play for our love of the school and the pride we get from representing Brown. We play for the practices and the games during which we sport the word “Brown” on our chests, and for the hours between those workouts when we proudly represent our school and our sport in classes and in the community. It is therefore disappointing to hear of our classmates’ opinion that completely disregards the value that 36 teams bring to campus. We came to this school knowing we wouldn’t play in front of enormous crowds; some teams even compete without an audience. Yet these same teams are active participants in our community, through classroom discussions, extra-curricular activities and campus engagement. Student-athletes make a positive contribution to Brown in various ways, whether as members of the Brown Band, participants in campus research initiatives or leaders on the Undergraduate Council of Students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So let’s build on that idea of our Brown community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While some claim that “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/21/august-19-kent-daggett-19-taswell-19-slam-dunk-proposal-brown-athletics/">wins bring little, if any, value to the broader Brown community</a>,” we beg to differ. All athletic teams bring value to our school not only through their wins or titles, but mainly through their actions and their symbolic value as rallying points for the Brown community. To us, Brown pride is evidenced in the 11,000 plus fans, including numerous students, who made their way back to campus in May 2016 ­— once summer break was already in full swing — to assemble at Brown Stadium and cheer on our men’s lacrosse team in the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament. Our school had twice as many fans in attendance that day as the other quarterfinal site.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Furthermore, student-athletes add value to Brown and Providence through the community engagement that they undertake. For instance, the men’s and women’s hockey teams have helped to clean up the Rhode Island beaches. Every Brown team was in attendance at the Vartan Gregorian Elementary School Kickoff Event just this past week, highlighting the decades-long relationship between our student-athletes and a local Providence school. We contribute to our school and the greater Brown community through events such as the weekly gathering of student-athletes on the top floor of the Sciences Library, who say goodnight to the kids at the Hasbro Children’s Hospital by pointing and flickering flashlights toward their windows. A strong community, which includes the broader Providence community, is not built on one or two superstar teams. It is instead built through repeated actions, big and small, that better the broader Brown and Providence community. Wins may play a part in this, as do the academic achievements of our fellow student-athletes and the community engagement of teams.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some may argue that the school budget and specifically the allotted $17.7 million the University puts into Brown sports is excessive. This money does not just go into varsity athletics, but also into the Nelson Fitness Center, as well as club and intramural sports. Additionally, as Glenn ’14, Meyers ’16, Johnston ’17 and Matsumoto ’16 aptly point out, the returns on this investment are tangible, as evidenced in student-athlete alumni donations. It is in fact important to note that 52 percent of the 2016-17 athletics budget was made up of philanthropy, which included 6,123 donors. The athletics pull, which again encompasses all Brown athletics from intramural to varsity sports, is undeniable when faced with these numbers. Considering that a large chunk of the athletics budget only exists because of philanthropists who are donating specifically to Brown athletics, the suggestion that the University simply reallocate the athletics budget toward its annual “Payment In Lieu of Taxes to the City of Providence” is unreasonable. Doing so would, by eliminating the 6,123 donors, actually halve the annual budget. We do recognize that the August ’19, Kent-Daggett ’19 and Taswell ’19 argument that millions be poured into the men’s and women’s basketball teams is hard to dispute, as the sport would likely see an improvement in its win-loss record. Yet the idea that this improvement would better the Brown community is less convincing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">All Brown student-athletes will tell you that playing in front of a sell-out crowd is an incomparable experience. But — as Glenn ’14, Meyers ’16, Johnston ’17 and Matsumoto ’16 argue — these same student-athletes will also tell you that they would refuse to cut all sports but their own, even if it would benefit their team. We would not be willing to take on the superstar status that comes with a sell-out crowd if it means cutting the eight children that have been added to various Brown rosters through Team Impact, an organization that connects children facing serious and chronic illnesses with college athletic teams. And why would we agree to reducing our student-athlete numbers, thereby hurting our peers and our friends? We would be agreeing to seeing not only our athletic community suffer, but also our broader Brown community and our city of Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you are looking for Brown pride, make sure to be in the stands next time a soccer player drills an overtime goal against cross-town rival Providence College, or when several student-athletes are honored for academic achievements at halftime of a game. While you’re in the stands, think of the broader impact that a single player, not to mention team, has on Brown and its neighboring community. Think about the child likely sitting a few seats away from you, who goes home after these games not only motivated to play sports, but also inspired to succeed academically. We’re assuming that while you sit in those stands, the thought of cutting 36 teams and telling the hundreds of student-athletes to find another passion would not even cross your mind.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Dear graduate student workers,</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We write to share with you our excitement for the upcoming election. As first-year graduate students who have not yet begun working for the University, we support you and will soon join you as teaching and research assistants. The group Stand Up for Graduate Student Employees has already welcomed us as new students with a community of mutual support and provided a platform for our voices. We recognize that graduate students are underrepresented in the discussions and decision-making processes that affect our experience, benefits and future opportunities. Graduate school can be an isolating experience for many. Our academic futures often lie in the hands of a very few gatekeepers in our fields. We can minimize that isolation and vulnerability by organizing a union. We believe unionization and a resulting contract of employment with the University is the only way to guarantee that graduate students will have greater representation and power in the decisions that determine our careers and lives.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What do we stand to gain by coming together in unionization? In addition to a seat at the table with decision makers, we will have a means of galvanizing hundreds of graduate students to fight for the changes we all need. Here are only a few examples of what we stand to gain.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Health and Family Care</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Imagine a university that respects our personal lives as much as the work and research we produce. As a union, we can follow in the steps of the graduate students at the University of Connecticut who fought to expand the categories of protected and paid leave “for reasons including, but not limited to, illness or injury, immigration hearings, pregnancy, to care for a newborn or adopted child or to care for an immediate family member,” as well as bereavement leave. Brown’s existing leave policies are far more limited and not enshrined in a contract. In addition to a union contract that guarantees health insurance, we could include vision coverage, as at the University of Washington. We could also prevent the University from altering policies without our notice or in non-compliance with our contract, as is stipulated by an agreement between Oregon State University and its graduate student union. Our contract could incorporate an easy-to-read yet comprehensive chart of benefits for reference, and our union representatives could also act as point-people to help us navigate complex and confusing health care terms and coverage.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Protection Against Discrimination and Harassment</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Imagine a university where graduate workers who experience discrimination or harassment can turn to their union for support. Imagine a grievance procedure independent of the administration. Our contract could provide support for any student worker who experiences discrimination or retaliation in violation of University policies, from a position crucially external to the University. Imagine an independent, graduate-led support system, available to walk you through options and support you through any investigation or bureaucratic process related to your complaint. Our contract could also delineate a clear procedure for a graduate student to contest the University’s ruling and seek to compel the University to better serve the affected student. We could emulate the University of Washington’s contract in binding the University to establish and maintain “a joint committee to discuss methods of recruiting and retaining, and encouraging career development of (graduate students) who belong to underrepresented groups” regarding workplace issues including disparate treatment based on native language or dialect and parental status. Like the UConn, our contract could stipulate explicitly that the University maintain guidelines to assist transgender and gender-diverse graduates and other groups not always covered by law or existing policy. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Working Conditions, Pay and Costs</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Imagine a university where our working conditions, responsibilities and pay are documented and guaranteed for the duration of our programs. Like all the contracts we reviewed, our contract could require that Brown clearly document all duties associated with a graduate’s appointment in advance of each semester and honor those terms. SUGSE could reserve the right to make recommendations to the University, including improved training for our worker positions. Our contract, like New York University’s, could also guarantee compensation for mandatory trainings that are a condition of our employment.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Graduate workers who pay a Student and Exchange Visitor Information System Fee or visa fee could be guaranteed reimbursement, as at Oregon State University. Our union could also agitate for immigration reform and press the University to continue taking clear stands in defense of our community of international graduates. Finally, as was achieved in every contract we reviewed, we could expect to receive an annual raise in our stipends. We can be confident that this raise would cover any annual union dues, as in the experience of all the other graduate student unions we investigated.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> These are just a few examples of what we stand to gain from unionization. Other graduate worker contracts contain articles on parking, housing and summer appointments. Perhaps most importantly, each contract contains an explicit grievance, appeal and arbitration procedure to address any violation of the contract. While the contracts incorporate and therefore cover violation of existing university policies, these procedures are independent of any existing University process and stipulate timely progression — for example, NYU’s provost is required to meet with the graduate and their union representative within 10 days of receipt of a grievance, and a response is required within another 10 days.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our graduate worker union will be our voice — we will collectively decide our unique goals and priorities through a democratic process. Unionization offers a forum for representation backed by the power of collective bargaining protected by U.S. labor law and grounded outside channels wholly controlled by the University. And finally, our contract is only the first step. SUGSE would remain active after our contract is signed through contractually guaranteed meetings between union representatives and the administration and/or required representation on administrative committees. We will continue to be a grassroots organization, working together to address emergent needs and aspirations.</span></p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear graduate student workers,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We write in response to the Nov. 5 op-ed “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/05/preston-gs-sindhu-gs-stand-gain-unionization/">What we stand to gain from unionization</a>,” and to respond more broadly to past claims made by Stand Up for Graduate Student Employees, which misled and divided this community. This is a dissenting opinion of sorts, but let us emphasize from the outset that none of us are against unionization on principle. Rather, we oppose SUGSE’s drive for unionization on campus at this time because of a different set of beliefs: a belief in honesty and personal integrity, a belief that the ends do not justify the means and a belief that those who would abuse their power should never be allowed to wield it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">We have arrived at this opinion through various paths. Some of us were initially supportive of this union, some skeptical, but the behavior of SUGSE has solidified our opinions against it. While the recent<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155687295946776&amp;set=a.10151398049761776&amp;type=3&amp;theater"> false accusation</a> of a conspiracy among administrators to disenfranchise people of color from a vote was the final straw, our aversion to SUGSE has long been building as a result of its persistently aggressive tactics, including angry rhetoric against anyone who disagrees with its cause (ourselves included), and harassing students by turning up at their homes and offices unannounced and calling their private numbers. There has been little public opposition to this unionization vote by graduate students, which gives SUGSE the incorrect impression that it has a mandate to act as it pleases. This letter is intended to address this state of affairs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Cynicism, Propaganda and Bad Faith </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In its attacks on University administrators, SUGSE accuses them of working to undermine the right of graduate student employees to decide whether to unionize. While it may be true that some members of the administration oppose unionization (as we should expect), we have seen no evidence that they have operated to discourage anyone from expressing their opinion. Rather, the administration has allowed SUGSE to move the voting process forward. In particular, the administration and SUGSE worked together to develop the Pre-Election Agreement, which borrows its model from the National Labor Relations Board. Both parties decided not to work with the NLRB directly because it is dominated by President Trump appointees. Instead, they <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/07/02/university-grad-students-finalize-pre-election-agreement-unionization/">agreed to adopt</a> its previous framework and respect the results of a vote without requiring a (currently unreliable) government agency’s direct involvement. These are not the actions of an administration that seeks to stifle student-employee voices. On the contrary, it is obvious that this administration values student input and respects the right of students to decide on this matter, despite objections its individual members may have.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The claim, often repeated by individual members of SUGSE, that the administration’s manipulation has forced SUGSE’s hand is a weak defense at best. Even if we accept the argument that SUGSE’s behavior is required by circumstance, its willingness to use the disenfranchisement of students of color to discredit the administration is misguided.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A stronger argument for a union should be made on principle alone, without reference to actions of administrators, but the arguments SUGSE prefers invariably cast administrators as villains.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The inclination to perceive every action by authority as motivated by selfishness has a name: cynicism. It should worry all graduate students that those who claim to represent us would so easily succumb to the temptation to see the worst in others. It should be concerning that SUGSE denies any kindness or good intentions in our administrative leaders, yet simultaneously demands a powerful leadership role for itself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SUGSE’s legitimacy rests on its claim to support all graduate students, but in practice, it only considers the views of those who share its goals. Brown students of color have repeatedly raised issues regarding unions in general, because unions have historically ignored the rights of underrepresented groups. SUGSE showed little concern for these legitimate objections to unionization in town halls and open meetings this semester. Recently, SUGSE changed course dramatically, accusing the administration of actively working to disenfranchise students of color by holding the election in a manner consistent with the Pre-Election Agreement. These students are not convenient bargaining chips to be used as leverage. From the Pre-Election Agreement’s conception, this disenfranchisement was present, but the needs of students from historically underrepresented groups were not considered. When this particular matter was brought to the attention of SUGSE last week, it was mentioned with the intention of shifting SUGSE’s proposed election dates, not to become a talking point. While the concerns of students from historically underrepresented groups have been raised to members of SUGSE, they refuse to reopen negotiations with administration to resolve said issues. Rather, SUGSE has resorted to taking the needs of those students and twisting them for their own purposes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Health and Family Care </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Those of us who have been at Brown for many years have experienced the sorts of personal crises that can arise in the course of graduate school, events which inevitably challenge any administration’s ability to support its students. In many real cases, the current administration has fought on our behalf. When one of us faced a life-threatening health condition, the administration sprang into action and actively supported him through his hospitalization and subsequent recovery. This is not an isolated incident. All of us know of situations in which the administration has helped us and our fellow graduate students, asking for nothing in return, but instead encouraging us to continue our studies and assuring that they would support us however they could. The administration is also actively working to improve support for graduate student parents and expand health care coverage.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, this is what they are supposed to do, and they get no special credit for doing it. But they should not be so readily considered our enemy, even in the battle over unionization. SUGSE’s resolve to attack the administration at every turn demands that we abandon our gratitude toward those who have invested time and money in our success. A call for unionization is reasonable and permissible, but it should not include unjustified attacks on those who have supported us. Even with a union, we will continue to work with the administration as both students and employees of the University. We will continue to believe in Brown as an organization engaged in the pursuit of higher ideals and in ourselves as something more than wage-earning employees.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Pay and Costs</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite naive claims to the contrary, the formation of a union does not free us from powerful authorities. It replaces one authority with another. The call for a union demands that we trust that SUGSE and the American Federation of Teachers will be better leaders than those we currently have. The evidence demonstrates otherwise. In our collective decades of experience as graduate student employees, the administration has repeatedly proven itself to be a trustworthy support system, while SUGSE’s overt cynicism and dishonesty suggest that it will be anything but. SUGSE members (particularly those who have been at Brown for only a few months) who have failed to realize that they can address their problems to administrators and count on their aid should not attack the open, good-faith relationship that the rest of us already enjoy with the graduate school administration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, finances matter to graduate students. Students in the bargaining unit will be required to pay union dues. While the specifics will not be decided until after the election, we have been told to expect to pay 1.5 to 2 percent of our annual stipend in dues — probably between $200 and $500, depending on department. That amount is similar to the annual raises Brown has consistently provided to current graduate students. While SUGSE promises that our dues will be offset with a raise, this assertion must be critically examined. The bargaining unit will not have unrestricted access to Brown’s financial books if we unionize, and <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/president/sites/president/files/Presidents_Financial_Report_FY17.pdf">available University financial reports</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/provost/accreditation/">accreditation report</a> make it clear that there is not an untapped pot of money available to dramatically increase graduate student stipends or benefits. (Despite what some union supporters claim, Brown’s $3.8 billion endowment cannot simply be drawn from to pay graduate students.) In our view, SUGSE has failed to articulate what cuts the University would realistically make to further enhance graduate student stipends and benefits, and we remain concerned that any benefits of unionization would not offset the costs, or worse, come at the expense of forward progress (e.g. limited recruitment of more underrepresented minority students as mandated by Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may not have been involved with this process so far, but you soon will be. Choosing not to vote leaves the most ideologically extreme to make this decision for everyone. Voting your conscience will ensure that the opinion of the graduate student body as a whole will determine the outcome. So we implore you, our fellow graduate students, to vote, and to think critically about your vote. Remember that a “no” vote is a vote against SUGSE’s union at this time, not a vote against future unionization at Brown.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the coming days, graduate student teaching and research assistants at Brown will vote on whether or not to unionize. This is an incredibly important decision. The outcome of this election will shape the processes that determine compensation, benefits and working conditions for current and future graduate students and affect the relationship between graduate students and the University.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though some of the rhetoric around unionization has been contentious, I see broad consensus on many points. We can all agree that graduate students are entitled to fair compensation and benefits, safe work environments and equitable treatment when concerns about working conditions are surfaced. We all want Brown to provide an inclusive and supportive environment where graduate students grow professionally and personally, work collaboratively with great colleagues and take pride and pleasure in their research and teaching.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The question is not what we want, but how best to achieve it. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Graduate students are currently being asked to weigh the pros and cons of unionization, factoring in possible gains in compensation and improvements in working conditions against the mandatory membership fees that come with unionization. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As graduate students make this choice, I encourage them to also consider the possible adverse consequences of unionization for Brown’s current system of shared governance, in which students, faculty and administrators work as partners to advance common goals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown has a long and strong commitment to shared governance, more so than at any other university I have seen. This commitment is reflected in Brown’s mission statement, which describes the University as “a partnership of students and teachers in a unified community.” This ideal is reflected by the active and widespread participation of graduate students — who are both students and teachers — in the governance of Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What does shared governance look like in practice? Currently, graduate students participate in at least 20 University committees that address everything from equity and diversity to the creation of new graduate student programs and campus sustainability. They serve on search committees for new senior administrators like provosts and deans. The president of the Graduate Student Council represents graduate student concerns on the Corporation Committee on Campus Life. In these formal roles — and at times through valuable activism — graduate students have championed diversity and inclusion, driven change in Brown’s Title IX policies and helped create childcare subsidies, among many other things. The University has long recognized and celebrated these contributions as fundamental to the fabric of a community committed to student-centered learning.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To give a concrete example: Graduate students are represented on the University Resources Committee, which makes recommendations each year on the University’s operating budget. In three of the past five years, the URC unanimously recommended percent increases in graduate student stipends that exceeded increases in the salary pools for faculty and staff, as well as improvements in health insurance and summer support. And these recommendations were approved. Through this process, the faculty, staff and undergraduate students on the URC demonstrated their appreciation for the important role that graduate students play at Brown, and became their champions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I don’t claim that shared governance works perfectly. Sometimes it is slow and unwieldy. For example, over the past several years it became clear that Brown needed a better policy for handling graduate student grievances. These concerns eventually led to the formation of a Graduate School committee (with graduate student representation) that worked over the summer to produce a new policy. The policy was vetted with relevant campus groups over the fall, and was approved by the faculty earlier this month. Though this process was slower than we would like, it yielded a great outcome. And it brought graduate students, faculty and administrators together to advance the wellbeing of graduate students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If Brown graduate students decide to unionize, I am committed to continuing on our current path of building superb graduate programs at Brown. We can’t be a great university without great graduate programs. And we will continue to practice shared governance where we can, in areas that don’t fall under the purview of the union.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am concerned, though, that unionization could shift the relationship between graduate students and the University in a way that damages the spirit and practice of shared governance and, ultimately, weakens the quality of the Brown experience for graduate students. I fear that, as we become categorized into workers and management who stand on opposing sides of a bargaining table, we will erode the unified partnership of students and teachers who work collectively to support graduate students and advance graduate education. This would be a loss for the entire Brown community.</span></p>

		<title>Wilks &#039;15 GS: Graduate student unionization improves power dynamics, institutional memory</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is important to celebrate our achievements; Brown University and its student, staff and faculty representatives have accomplished a lot in its very long history. However, the recent barrage of propaganda targeting graduate students on a daily basis from various administrative offices in response to the pending unionization vote raises some troubling concerns, particularly because it emanates from some of the only individuals within our community who have a full picture of happenings on campus. This kind of messaging erases the many students who have not had positive experiences at Brown and the many hours of work required of students who advocate for themselves because their basic needs are not being met. The two strongest arguments for unionization center on equalizing this kind of one-sided narrative. First, a union would even out the power dynamic in our shared governance model in which graduate students are currently the most vulnerable. Second, a union would provide institutional memory for graduate student voices by documenting grievances, student retention and patterns of abuse.</p>
<p class="p2">The progress cited in administrative emails, proselytizing postcards and posters dropped off in various departments directly resulted from<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>student advocacy consisting of hours of dialogue, sometimes protest, and other forms of unpaid labor. This kind of advocacy work to improve our working conditions via dialogue — and on the rare occasion protest — is how we are already improving our working conditions. We bring our individual or collective issues to our directors of graduate study, chairs, departments, deans and various offices on campus. However, a union would formalize this mechanism of advocacy work so that graduate students can collectively discuss the issues that matter to us. Some issues affect us all — such as wages, grievance procedures, wrongful termination — or disproportionately affect some among us, such as student parents (childcare, health insurance), international students (visas, federal policies like the immigration ban), undocumented students (the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program) and students from historically underrepresented groups (microaggression training, Title VII, Title IX, cultural competency education). By uniting graduate students under the aegis of a union, we would have a formal mechanism to discuss and document the issues that matter to us and bring those issues to the bargaining table with the American Federation of Teachers backing us. This is in stark contrast to the current situation, where we are siloed within our respective departments with little to no formal power to negotiate or prevent arbitrary changes to our benefits or status. Currently, we must plead to whoever will listen to advocate on our behalf. With a union, we negotiate at the table.</p>
<p class="p2">In any workplace there are inherent power differentials. At Brown, graduate students are at the bottom of the heap. I believe that in most cases when a student approaches a dean for support, the dean will do everything they can to help. I’ve personally met with many senior administrators and believe that many, if not most of them, care deeply about the Brown community — including graduate students — and are working tirelessly to try to make the institution a better place for us. However, in the all too possible scenario that the dynamic of a complaint becomes student versus the University, the inherent power dynamic stipulated by a dean’s financial security and career prospects pose a direct conflict of interest. By definition, no one employed by the University can truly be independent or unbiased because their job security depends on supporting the institution. That is why external reviews by independent third parties exist. Even if your complaints are heard and pursued by a dean, what are the potential outcomes?</p>
<p class="p2">The University has a system of shared governance characterized by strong decentralized departments. There are many benefits to this structure, but the bureaucratic policies that ensure autonomy can make administrative intervention challenging, especially in departments with faculty leadership that have an adversarial relationship with the administration. I find it difficult to imagine how bringing in deans to engage with faculty who might have skepticism and animosity toward the administration will mediate, not inflame an already challenging situation. Furthermore, the few cases I’ve seen play out don’t support the hypothesis that administrative intervention de-escalates the situation or results in a desirable outcome for the student. A union would provide a third party mediator that could have better success than University administrators in this regard and would support students in navigating bureaucracy and legalese.</p>
<p class="p2">As a counterargument, I often hear administrators make the case that the dissertation committee exists as a form of checks and balances, and in the off-chance that an advisor oversteps their authority, the committee will intervene. But why? Tenure-track faculty positions are permanent whereas students are transient. I don’t want to imply that no faculty member ever sticks their neck out for students and advocates on their behalf to the chagrin of their colleague. However, the academic system is engineered to make choosing to fight for a student against a colleague an uphill battle. In the vast majority of cases that I’m aware of, the student is moved to a different advisor or even department, to continue — that is, effectively restart — their studies, or given the option of “mastering out.” Obviously, these are imperfect solutions, and at the very least we should agree that students deserve grievance redressal options.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Additionally, a union provides the benefit of documentation — institutional memory. The accumulation of data by documenting complaints by graduate students across the institution is powerful. It affords us a record that we currently don’t have due to the cyclical nature of graduate student turnover and the siloing of graduate students into departments, both of which inhibit the growth of an information network. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The constant turnover of students is intrinsically linked to institutional memory: the narratives that are preserved or quietly forgotten. Without robust systems of reporting in place to document formal and informal complaints between various offices, events are interpreted as extraordinary instead of common, and patterns of abuse cannot be identified nor perpetrators held accountable. As far as I can tell, Brown does not currently have a system in place to aggregate information from academic or administrative offices, whether informal or formal (Title VI, Title VII, Title IX or the ombudsperson), that would enable the centralized tracking of complaints.</p>
<p class="p2">Unfortunately, complaints defined by “this person said, that person said” are difficult to substantiate. They are even more difficult to investigate when viewed singularly instead of within the context of a pattern of behavior. This necessary context can only come from a system that aggregates this kind of data from multiple sources. Furthermore, even if that data were to exist, would we ever have access to it? If nothing else, a union’s record-keeping ability is justification enough to unionize. We need graduate student voices to have permanent memory in the form of a union and the data it collects. With this information, we can begin to ask our own questions about graduate student retention and patterns of abuse that arise from the accumulation of complaints so that our individual knowledge about abuse of power isn’t dictated by our circle of friends, department or if we’ve been around long enough to witness it firsthand.</p>
<p class="p2">As I conclude, I’d be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge my concerns about the numerous accounts I’ve heard about individual members of Stand Up for Graduate Student Employees overstepping boundaries into territory that may be categorized as harassment. While I should clarify that receiving a cold call does not amount to harassment, I wonder what mechanisms SUGSE has in place or can think about implementing to facilitate the collection of critical feedback when representatives act in ways that conflict with the mission and values of the organization. For graduate students who are anti-SUGSE, not anti-union, I would remind you that SUGSE is a grassroots organization comprised almost entirely of our graduate student peers, and I fundamentally believe that graduate students have the capacity and incentive to be far better advocates for one another than the University could ever be. Why not vote, or better yet run, for elected positions within the union governing body that will advocate for what you care about in a contract if you don’t oppose the union altogether?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In a report circulated to students in an early October email, the Office of the Dean of the College proposed the combination of Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs’ three undergraduate concentrations into one concentration, which would be the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/concentrations/">third largest</a> concentration at Brown. This proposal, which merges public policy, international relations and development studies, strips each concentration of its unique characteristics and agglomerates them into an entirely unremarkable patchwork of onerous requirements that lack direction. By merging what are unique fields of study, it is clear that Watson seriously undervalues public policy as a concentration and disregards American public policy as a topic that warrants individualized study. In sum, Watson’s proposal undermines Brown’s core values — interdisciplinary coursework, individualized education and student engagement.</p>
<p class="p2">In an era of polarized politics, with a president whose proposals are ambiguous and whose claims are unsubstantiated, there has perhaps never been a greater need for professionals who have the skills to understand exactly how public policy affects people and communities. The University’s public policy concentration educates students to become these much-needed public policy professionals by allowing them to study the life cycle of the American policy making process, from the passage of policies to their implementation and effects. By choosing a focus on a specific policy issue, students gain a deep and nuanced understanding of America’s urban, environmental or health policies, among others.</p>
<p class="p2">In this political environment, which is increasingly devoid of fact, students have recognized the importance of an education in public policy. After Donald Trump became president in 2016, the number of graduating public policy concentrators <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/concentrations/">doubled</a> from 21 to 42. For years, the University recognized the distinct value in studying U.S. policy. But the new proposal reverses years of institutional policy and ignores the desires and interests of many students — and the broad needs of the United States. We, as public policy concentrators, urge the administration and Watson’s faculty leadership to recognize one thing: Public policy’s main strength comes directly from what the new report claims is its weakness, namely its distinct focus <a href="http://files.constantcontact.com/b73a840a001/00ac65be-3843-4d5f-8d79-098f396329c7.pdf">“on U.S. policy.”</a></p>
<p class="p2">The proposed concentration has an overwhelming focus on international issues, essentially removing a student’s ability to concentrate on American public policy at Brown. Of the five proposed required core courses, none are focused on the American context; the <a href="http://files.constantcontact.com/b73a840a001/00ac65be-3843-4d5f-8d79-098f396329c7.pdf">proposal</a> goes as far as to suggest that an existing class, PLCY 0100: “Introduction to Public Policy,” change its coursework to become more international. The proposal also suggests that students might be required to take three years of a foreign language, which would strongly deter and place an unnecessary burden on students who simply wish to study U.S. public policy. Three years of a language can take up to 20 percent of a concentrator’s classes at Brown, and the proposal does nothing to justify such onerous requirements for students wishing to focus on the American context. Yes, a study of American policy would be enhanced by more internationally focused classes and foreign languages, but requiring this many classes goes too far. In essence, this new proposal deletes the public policy concentration as we know it and makes it impossible for students to concentrate in American public policy.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The proposal undermines Brown’s open curriculum by making it almost impossible for students to pursue other areas of interest. The public policy concentration requires students to take courses in at least three different policy areas and is inherently multidisciplinary. It also provides students with a strong theoretical, quantitative and ethical background through its five core courses. However, apart from those few requirements, concentrators have the ability to explore the policy issues that interest them — with the option to take electives in over a dozen different departments. With <a href="http://files.constantcontact.com/b73a840a001/00ac65be-3843-4d5f-8d79-098f396329c7.pdf">10 requirements plus a senior capstone</a>, the current public policy concentration offers students the flexibility to pursue a double concentration. Two of us are currently double concentrators. The new proposal, on the other hand, requires students to take as many as 20 classes and thus makes it nearly impossible to double-concentrate. Ultimately, public policy at Brown typifies the open curriculum: It allows students to pursue their passions for politics and policy without sacrificing their interests in other subject areas. By contrast, the proposed concentration undermines Brown’s core values with its burdensome list of requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p2">While Watson has attempted to dodge student concerns by stating that a committee of Watson faculty “has not yet finalized its review or begun drafting its recommendations,” no further information has been released. In addition, given that a new proposal is expected to be released next month, we are skeptical that the Watson committee will sufficiently account for student criticisms. Therefore, we believe it is important to critique the Dean of the College’s proposal in its current state.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite the gravity of this proposal and its outsized effects on the public policy concentration, Watson has done the bare minimum to solicit input from students. On Oct. 12, 2018, students in all three Watson concentrations received a surprising email from Watson leadership with the subject line “Watson Undergraduate Town Hall Meetings.” Upon first glance, the email seemed like one of Watson’s frequent promotional emails. If one spent time reading further, however, this nondescript email revealed the new and drastic proposal. Hidden in plain sight within a hyperlink at the email’s end was a document labeled “2018 Watson Committee Recommendations” that, in 25 pages, mainly argued one thing: all three Watson concentrations should be consolidated into one. No further effort has been made to explain the proposal in detail to concentrators and only three, hour-long town halls have been held to solicit feedback from students who made an independent effort to understand the gravity of the attached proposal. It does not seem that Watson has a genuine interest in gauging students’ reactions to the proposal. Watson’s lack of transparency and effective outreach to students when making fundamental decisions about the structure of their chosen education is just one of the new proposal’s many failures. We argue not only that the proposal ignores student wants but also that its broadcast has not afforded students the opportunity to understand the gravity of these institutional changes. Watson has a responsibility to openly seek student input beyond coded emails and poorly publicized town hall meetings.</p>
<p class="p2">While many of our peers, including public policy concentrators, still remain unaware of this major transformation due to Watson’s inadequate outreach, we believe there is time to demand that public policy remain an independent discipline. There has never been a more important time to have a public policy concentration at Brown to teach students about the intricacies of U.S. public policy. While there is room for improvement in the current concentration, this new proposal deletes the public policy concentration entirely. Watson, in a continuation of its piecemeal efforts to gauge students’ feelings about the proposal, has opened a<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPt7J4-8nCP_hysJVYdJhvi2ZI4N8XNjBUpoSaMyKaYxU5Iw/viewform"> Google Form</a> where students can provide feedback on their concentrations. We implore public policy students and the broader Brown community to criticize the proposal through that form or by emailing watson-director@brown.edu.</p>

		<title>Flores ’18 MD ’22: Demand justice in Yemen and action from R.I. Democrats</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The war in Yemen has resulted in what United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres describes as “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.” It may also rank among the least reported global conflicts, with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-arms-sales-embargo-us-yemen-civil-war-famine-trump-congress-a8651931.html">one-third of Americans</a> unaware a war in Yemen is even taking place. There is strong reason to believe the United States is complicit in creating a humanitarian disaster in Yemen. Saudi Arabia’s blockade of Yemen’s main port city has led to a severe famine in the country, with millions of Yemenis at risk of starvation. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46261983">New estimates</a> indicate that up to 85,000 children have already <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/middleeast/humanitarian-groups-yemen-plea-intl/index.html">starved to death</a> or died of related diseases since fighting erupted. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-s-bombing-of-yemeni-farmland-is-a-disgraceful-breach-of-the-geneva-conventions-a7376576.html">Several cholera outbreaks</a> in the country have similarly been linked to deliberate attacks on agricultural and water infrastructure by Saudi-led forces. When a bus full of children was bombed in an airstrike in August, the bomb used was supplied by the United States. In the past decade, the United States has <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/02/27/what-has-49-billion-in-foreign-military-aid-bought-us-not-much-pub-75657">sold $89 billion in arms</a> to Saudi Arabia. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In February of this year, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/376157-sanders-lee-push-for-end-to-us-involvement-in-yemen-war">Senate Joint Resolution 54</a> was proposed to cease American military support to the Saudi-led coalition by invoking the War Powers Resolution. However, the Senate motioned to table the resolution with a vote of 55-44 and it was essentially dead in the water. Unfortunately, Rhode Island’s senators failed to check the Trump administration’s continued support for Saudi Arabia’s campaign in Yemen. Ten Democrats joined Republican senators in voting against the resolution, including Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Jack Reed, D-R.I. In the future, Whitehouse and Reed must use their power to curb the United States’ involvement in ongoing humanitarian crises before they grow astronomically worse. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since 2015, the United States has backed the Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen materially in the form of weapons, intelligence and midair refueling of Saudi planes. While the Pentagon has claimed that its support for the Saudi campaign is limited to those means, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/us/politics/green-berets-saudi-yemen-border-houthi.html?module=inline">reported</a> in May that the United States Army deployed its special forces on the Saudi border with Yemen. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yemen was already one of the poorest countries in the region before the war began. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-44466574">In 2014</a>, Houthi rebels, mostly Shia and opposed to Yemen’s ruling regime, seized control of land in northern Yemen and the country’s capital, Sanaa. In a purported effort to restore Yemen’s government, Saudi Arabia began airstrikes against the rebels in 2015. Exacerbated by the conflict, conditions are harrowing for the millions of Yemenis facing cholera outbreaks, coalition airstrikes on civilian targets and potential famines. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Whitehouse <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-44466574">rationalized his March vote</a> against Senate Joint Resolution 54 by saying, “I don’t see how precipitous withdrawal of the limited support the U.S. military provides would make things better in achieving our humanitarian or strategic aims.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Since March, conditions in Yemen have become more untenable. International outrage over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi government may have been the impetus for Reed to introduce the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act of 2018 along with other senators. He describes the bill as “comprehensive legislation to ensure effective Congressional oversight of U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia and Yemen and demand meaningful accountability for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Thankfully, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, reintroduced Senate Joint Resolution 54 for a vote yesterday, and both <a href="https://twitter.com/igorbobic/status/1067877076143886336">Whitehouse</a> and <a href="http://www.630wpro.com/2018/11/28/senator-announces-support-for-ending-us-action-in-yemen/">Reed</a> voted in favor of the resolution this time around. The Senate <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/28/senate-pull-saudi-support-yemen-1025657">overall voted</a> 63-37 to advance the legislation, moving it one step closer to passage. But, going forward, Rhode Island’s representatives in Congress must do more, and act much earlier, to prevent American military involvement in humanitarian crises. Months after Senate Joint Resolution 54 was first tabled, the civilian death toll in the port city of Hodeidah — which has been the target of concerted coalition attacks in recent months — <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/civilian-casualties-soar-yemens-hodeidah-devastating-offensive-began-june">grew by 164 percent</a>, compared to the first five months of 2018. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We can’t wait as the United States abets horrific acts. We can’t wait as innocent civilians perish in intolerable conditions. By failing to demand justice, we continue to muddy the ethical line in the sand in the already turbid proverbial waters of the Middle East.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The unprecedented form of mass migration of Central Americans has defeated typical government responses to prevent poor people and refugees from migrating to the United States. As we have seen in the last few days, it has also inflamed the U.S. government’s violent treatment of migrants. I want to analyze the form that this migration has taken because, at its core, it is an anti-imperial call to all humans spectating. It is a call that our governments do not want us to understand. I want to amplify the urgent call of thousands of Central Americans now asking for our help and posit this call as an opportunity to resist living within imperial structures.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This humanitarian crisis is a direct product of the imperial systems set up through colonialism, or what Aníbal Quijano, the Peruvian sociologist, has called the “coloniality” of power and global capitalism. Under coloniality, the accumulation of political and economic power is in the hands of a few descendants of Europeans (both whites and mestizos, mixed-race individuals with European heritage). The United States has intervened militarily in Central America since the region’s independence from Spain, and most recently in the second half of the 20th century, to ensure the unequal distribution of land and the exploitation of resources by multinational companies. During the Cold War, this was done in the name of containing the spread of communism, as former president Ronald Reagan would state in his address to the nation in 1984. For many indigenous and poor people, this meant that the Central American elites would continue to own stolen land and maintain political power through corruption and force.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The transnational movement of these migrants has defied the imaginary space of the borders mapped by the nation-states, borders that depend on violence to manage human movement. The first group of people to leave from Honduras Oct. 13 was estimated to be about 3,000 people. Given that they overwhelmingly outnumbered the Guatemalan police force at the border, the Honduran migrants simply started walking across the border after a couple hours of waiting, leaving the police unable to contain them. As the group went into Guatemala in the following weeks, more people from El Salvador and Guatemala joined despite threats from their governments and from the governments of Mexico and the United States. The name caravan attempts to describe a choreographic tactic of mass movement that has effectively challenged and defeated the hostility inherent in national borders. In transgressing two national borders, as they entered the state of Mexico, the migrants have successfully contested the grip of coloniality in our imaginations and bodily movements.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">President Trump has threatened to withdraw U.S. aid from Honduras if the migrants were not stopped. U.S. direct intervention is not unprecedented in Honduras; in fact, current Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández reached power via fraudulent elections supported by the United States. Notably, the aid given to Central American governments does not affect poor communities and the conditions they are escaping. If the United States really wanted to stop the exodus of marginalized Central Americans, it should support anti-corruption legal procedures and do more to hold political leaders in the region’s governments accountable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This, of course, will not happen because the U.S. government depends on its grip on Central American governments to advance imperial, neoliberal economic policies that exploit Central American laborers and serve the profits of transnational companies. The threats and measures being proposed by these governments reflect the enduring power of coloniality. The call of these migrants exists outside of this colonial regime. These people are at the end of colonial time. In other words, their lives will end, just like many of the people around them, if they stay in their home countries. One single mother in the caravan justifies fleeing to avoid the killing of her son in the same way her husband had been killed: “Some people say that we are exposing ourselves by traveling so far, but this is nothing compared to everything that we face in Colón.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Central American migrants are stepping into a different temporality, a different experience of time, to survive. These migrants are engaging with the reality that they are in the end times — a phenomenon Professor of Theater Arts and Performance Studies Patricia Ybarra has observed in the works of Latinx playwrights writing about migration. This experience of time has moved them out of the colonial understanding of time and space that prohibits them from walking to the United States to escape their plight. The end times brings with it the possibility to end coloniality.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The sustenance of this anti-imperial movement has so far depended on the solidarity of others along the way. People in Guatemala and Mexico have organized themselves to provide food, shelter, medicine and transport for the migrants. It is the involvement of non-governmental agents that has ensured that these desperate human beings do not succumb to the system that has been and is ready to let them die from starvation and other forms of state violence. These active spectators, as part of a global audience, have decided to sustain this anti-imperial phenomenon, thereby not only saving lives but also opening up a possibility for a decolonial movement — one that disregards the temporal, spatial and spiritual grip of coloniality.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am not trying to romanticize this mass exodus. The harsh reality is that decolonial movements are met with extreme violence from nation-states. So far, as I have argued, the form of this migration and responses of solidarity have overwhelmed the colonial responses. Yet, the destination of this movement is the territory occupied by the most violent and richest modern empire, the United States. Trump has said that if the migrants at the border throw rocks, the military should open fire as if the rocks were rifles, justifying military action by stating that the Central American migrants are not real asylum seekers. Tear gas has already been thrown at migrant families. I am worried. Here lies the migrants’ call to us all, to the global audience, in Mexico, the United States and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am calling into question the voice that looks at this humanitarian crisis and tells us that these fellow human beings are separate from us. The call is to resist an imperialism that prohibits us from looking beyond borders. Let’s follow the lead of others in Central America who have organized in solidarity and against the coloniality pursued by our governments. The anti-imperial call I am outlining is a survival tactic, and it is also a call for us to not be imperial agents who refuse to acknowledge the humanity of those at our doorstep, to reclaim our existence in a non-imperial world. In this sense, the Central American forced migration is a humanitarian crisis, but not only because the migrants’ lives are at risk, but because their call questions what it means for all of us to be human within imperial systems. Better yet, it asks us to stand together outside of imperial time and space.</span></p>

		<title>Hall &#039;20: Climate change deserves your attention</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brown has a well-earned reputation for social justice advocacy. It’s with good reason that Fox News host Jesse Watters perennially prowls our campus for soundbites. But among the wide array of injustices that students at Brown protest, climate change lies surprisingly low on the list. It doesn’t have to — and shouldn’t — be this way. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recent events might contradict this view — including the demonstration that members of Rhode Island Sunrise staged against Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez’s ’83 P’18 decision to oveturn the DNC’s ban on accepting fossil fuel money. But the fact remains that climate activism at Brown is under-prioritized. The University has effectively quelled divestment campaigns multiple times, and climate activism groups see relatively low engagement. Divestment campaigns at Harvard and Yale are both active and have many times more members, judging by Facebook stats, than Brown’s (which does not appear to be active this academic year). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Climate groups that I have visited in the past were lucky to see more than 10 people show up to meetings. There are environmental organizations within the University, such as the Climate Development Lab and the Institute at Brown for the Environment and Society, that do excellent work, but they do not have a prominent presence on campus outside of their niche. While I can’t speak to this semester in particular, I have often found the few events that IBES hosts each term under-attended by students outside of environmental concentrations. As such a student myself, I rarely hear about opportunities for climate activism or education at Brown unless I go looking for them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Contrast this situation to that of Oxford University in the United Kingdom, where I am studying abroad this year. The student climate society hosts high-profile events and socials to connect and build a community around the issue. There are over 10 such events each trimester, and they are well-publicized and regularly reach capacity. Here, a large-scale and well-publicized fossil fuel divestment campaign puts constant pressure on the university administration. As a result, climate change has entered the host of subjects at the forefront of many students’ minds, and I’m sure that more than a few career trajectories have been changed. My experience here has convinced me that Brown can and should engage more deeply with climate change.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Granted, it can be especially difficult to motivate student action on climate change. Many of the problems that students care about carry such importance because they are pressing. Gender discrimination is happening now, sexual assault is happening now; each harms millions of people in the United States daily. Climate change often gets framed as a problem located squarely in the future. One can also get the impression that environmental activism is a hobby for the rich and privileged, who do not have to defend themselves from immediate injustices and so focus, perhaps even for show, on the climate instead. But anyone who cares about social justice should put climate change near the top of their list of concerns. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The reason for this is simple: Left alone, climate change will start to drastically exacerbate nearly every social injustice plaguing the United States and the world within the next few years. In many cases, it already has. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in October gave the world 12 years to prevent the worst effects associated with 2°C of warming or more. More immediate still is the threat from biodiversity loss, which has already destroyed insect populations that form integral parts of many ecosystems — including those upon which human societies desperately depend. Increasingly, people are realizing that climate change is a humanitarian emergency unfolding right now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Among climate scientists and researchers, it is established fact that those who are already the worst off will suffer the most from climate change. This holds true both globally and within the United States. One oft-cited international example is Bangladesh. With most of its land located below sea level, and a population still striving for developed nation status, Bangladesh will face massive and deadly consequences due to rising sea levels and more violent weather well before wealthy countries will. Add to this the fact that Bangladesh historically has not seen many of the benefits of carbon-producing industry in the West, and you start to see why climate change carries potential for great social injustice — as many researchers have been arguing for years.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The situation within the United States looks much the same. The worst effects of climate change in the coming years will fall on our poorest and most disadvantaged communities, including indigenous peoples. Flooding along the southern coast already disproportionately affects low-income people. As such, absent radical change, global warming will massively increase inequality in our country — which means environmental activism is social activism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Simultaneously, effectively fighting environmental decay and climate change will require independent social activism and progress on nearly all of the issues promoted so vigorously at Brown. Low-income and disadvantaged communities that already face the harms of climate change are still held down by institutional oppression. Movements like the one to end felony disenfranchisement in Florida will not only reduce current injustice; they will also empower people to take control of their local politics and protect themselves from future injustices.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Maybe the toughest thing about climate change is figuring out what we as individuals can do about it. At Brown, however, there are clear avenues for both immediate action and long-term engagement. Groups like SunriseRI, Climate Action League and others under the emPOWER umbrella can all use more members — so join them. Aside from campus and political activism, we also each have an incredibly powerful tool for social change in the form of our future careers. As students, we should educate ourselves about the problem now so that we can work to solve it once we leave university. Take advantage of Brown’s unique flexibility to take courses on sustainable development and the environment. No matter your concentration or passion, you can find ways apply it to climate change — the scale and complexity of the problem guarantee it.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of us want to stay up-to-date on the news. More than 250 Brown students take it one step further. They wake up to DailyChatter, a short newsletter that covers vitally important but under-covered events.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DailyChatter drops into inboxes at six o’clock every weekday morning. Its ambitious mission is to brief readers on “the world in two minutes.” Recent topics have included a rare meeting between two major opponents seeking to lead Libya, a crackdown on corrupt politicians in Malaysia and court convictions for the murder of an indigenous rights activist in Honduras.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DailyChatter is an independent and non-partisan newsletter, which for the past year, has been available and free for Brown students and faculty. The DailyChatter’s news service team partnered with the Brown Journal of World Affairs to give students and faculty access to their subscription last semester. The Journal seeks to start serious academic discussions about pressing global issues. Its leaders believed that campus-wide access would allow students to contribute meaningfully to those discussions. In a few concise paragraphs, DailyChatter provides the essentials on all the topics it covers — necessary background information, news and analysis. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fellow students and DailyChatter subscribers have found the newsletter a useful tool to learn about parts of the world that often escape mainstream media attention. The format of the newsletter is particularly convenient, allowing busy students to set aside a few minutes and learn something new. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The founder and co-executive editor of DailyChatter, Philip Balboni, is an international news enthusiast and entrepreneur who has spent the past 50 years working in print, television and digital journalism. From his office on the Boston waterfront, he supervises a team of nine dedicated professionals who create DailyChatter’s original content. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DailyChatter fills an important gap in the market. It responds to a growing demand for clear and complete, yet accessible information. It is more comprehensive, not to mention more global than your Twitter feed or even the New York Times’ Morning briefing and The Wall Street Journal’s The 10-Point. There is no app to download and nothing to type into your search bar: DailyChatter is a truly low-effort endeavor for readers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Each edition focuses on five different topics from around the world. The daily digest includes a “Need to know” section, a detailed yet pithy report on a noteworthy region. The same country is never featured two days in row, nor twice within the same week. The newsletter always ends with a globally-focused scientific “Discoveries” section, meant as a change of pace from more conventional news. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Front page news involving the United States and other major powers is, when warranted, featured in DailyChatter. Recently, it has not failed to include the G20 summit in Argentina, the conflict in Yemen, the unfolding of Brexit and protests in France. However, DailyChatter does not highlight American or European interests and viewpoints. It strives to remain fair — one of its core values. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The condensed nature of its 1,200-word format must not, however, be misinterpreted for a lack of journalistic rigor. DailyChatter is written and edited by highly-experienced reporters. They collect information through a variety of reporting sources, but the newsletter publishes original work, Balboni said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Balboni is based in Boston, the rest of the team is scattered around the globe. Some of the other members are based in vastly different places, ranging from Delhi, Berlin and Paris to Washington, D.C. Though many subscribers pay to receive DailyChatter, it is available for free at more than 36 universities around the United States. The company is able to fund its university initiative through grants from the Knight Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, as well as through partnerships with media outlets such as the Boston Globe and individual subscriptions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DailyChatter does not seek to usurp readership from traditional American media. However, a few minutes spent a day learning about issues affecting those whom we otherwise rarely read about is time well-spent.</span></p>

		<title>Kim &#039;19, Schuetz ’19.5: Reflecting on leavetaking at Brown</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The first Halloweekend of 2018, we — leavetaking coordinators at the Curricular Resource Center — traveled to Duke University to participate in the Returning Students Conference with Associate Deans of the College Peggy Chang and Mary Greineder. The conference brought together deans of student and academic affairs from across the country to discuss support and share resources for students returning from leaves of absence. As students ourselves, we were privileged to have the opportunity to share our stories with representatives from 30 different colleges and universities. Two undergrads among a sea of deans and college staff, we caught a glimpse of how student leavetaking experiences, philosophies, cultures and policies differ across campuses. Despite these differences, all these schools are coming to embrace<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a shared understanding of the importance of centering student voices — which will hopefully manifest in more opportunities for us to make leavetaking more accessible and less prohibitive here at Brown.</p>
<p class="p2">We write and reflect here to share how, behind the scenes, deans, staff and student advocates work to make managing and navigating university resources around leavetaking more accessible and transparent. We want to share our experience to demystify leavetaking for students and reiterate the fact that deans and students like us are here to provide support throughout the process — and that we’re here to encourage, rather than discourage, students to make the choices right for them.</p>
<p class="p2">At Brown, while taking a leave of absence is certainly not a norm, leavetaking is far from unheard of. According to our conversations with staff in the Dean of the College, an average of 200 undergraduates take time off from Brown every year, and reasons to take leave vary as widely as the human experience does. Students at Brown can take off for one semester, two, eight or even more than 50 years and still return to complete their degrees. For students at Brown, taking leave can be as simple as meeting with one of us, talking with any Academic and Advising Dean or communicating with a Dean from the Office of Student Support Services to coordinate a plan of care before, during and after leave. Some students may plan their leaves several semesters in advance, incorporating a leave of absence into a clear and determined path. Others may take a leave unexpectedly right before or during the semester and have to navigate other complicating factors, which may include stigma, family support, family obligations, cultural values and expectations, citizenship status and varying definitions of success.</p>
<p class="p2">Taking a leave of absence is a prime example of charting one’s own education. Conceptions of leavetaking as a legitimate option are shaped in part by being at place like Brown. The prestige of having been admitted to such an elite institution can compound the normative myth that college is a simple four-year journey. But the narratives and lived experiences of leavetakers, past and present, attest to the validity and power of these alternative paths. As Attayah Douglass ’18.5 shared in her Mid-Year Completion speech, she is proud of the ways in which her peers “are all reclaiming what it means to have a quintessential college experience.”</p>
<p class="p2">The challenges faced by students who take leave are not often well-understood by their peers. Near the conference’s close, we got a chance to speak on the “Student Voices” panel. We shared our experiences upon returning and the general transition back to campus. When someone asks you how your semester — or year, three years, even more — away from Brown was, or why you took leave, or how it feels to be back, how are you supposed to respond? The answer has never been quite clear to us, but we did get a chance to respond on our panel.</p>
<p class="p2">Our moderator, a fellow student, put it best when she shared how she felt that the process of leave was never quite over even when she returned to campus. She described how we never really shed the time we’ve spent away, as it is inextricably part of who we are now. Though we may be considered “returned leavetakers,” we are as much molded by the time we have spent away from school, as we are being students at our respective institutions. Our audience at the conference treated the panel as a holding space — a challenging platform to recall difficult moments, but also a place to find healing by sharing experiences. Through these intimations, it almost felt as if we were participating in some collective uplift and validation of what we’d gone through, albeit with the differences between our individual experiences.</p>
<p class="p2">As leavetaking coordinators, we work to motivate that kind of radical acceptance of our own personal journeys. This is the environment we seek to cultivate at the CRC. Leavetaking can seem like an overwhelming process with lots of complicated policies to navigate on your own, but it doesn’t have to be. At the end of the day, taking leave is about self-care and restoration — about coming to terms with yourself, what you need and how those around you can help. In this vein, we offer a range of services and support for students considering taking leave. We offer peer-advising open hours, provide online information clarifying all stages of the leavetaking process, compile resources for students to plan their time away, liaise between students and Brown administrative offices and create platforms for students to share their leavetaking stories — both in-person and through various media — to be shared with future generations of leavetakers.</p>
<p class="p2">As we disembarked from the plane and drove back to campus after the conference, a swell of emotions overswept us. There are so many people, including college staff, who are doing significant work on behalf of students — who are advocating for us, making historically gated communities (like private universities) easier to maneuver. With them, we can build on this work together to aspire and manifest the changes we seek. Leavetaking at Brown is still far from perfect, so we’re still looking ahead to fill the gaps. We’ve been in conversation with the Undergraduate Council of Students Wellness committee to introduce a care-package program to forge stronger bonds between current undergrads and leavetakers, and are currently working to waive the $70 re-admission fee that is not widely advertised for returning students.</p>
<p class="p2">Above all else, this conference gave us an opportunity to look back to our experiences as leavetakers ourselves, remember the feelings that led up to our decisions to take a break from Brown and dig back into how we took care of ourselves in the ways we knew best at the time. In the work we do today, we’re glad that we can intentionally empathize with our peers and do what sometimes goes ignored in building relationships and forging human connections: Just be there for each other. It’s the least we can do — and we’re glad that we can do it together.</p>
<p class="p4"><em>Soyoon Kim ’19 can be reached at soyoon_kim@brown.edu. She’s working through it, as we all are. Addy Schuetz ’19.5 can be reached at addy_schuetz@brown.edu. They believe that time, love and stories are the most valuable things we have. As leavetaking coordinators at the Curricular Resource Center, Soyoon and Addy can be reached at leavetakers@gmail.com. Soyoon and Addy want to extend a special thanks to Dean Chang and Dean Greineder from Brown for their unfaltering love and support, and Duke University’s Dean Sabrina Thomas and the Office of Student Returns Ambassadors there for their hospitality, generosity and care.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has declared her candidacy for president. As the first name-brand politician to have officially launched a bid, she had an opportunity to set a thoughtful tone for the next two years of campaigning. I think she failed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let me be clear from the outset: I’m not comfortable with holding the Democratic Party to a “good by default” standard just because the Republican Party is currently controlled by a terrible president. And Warren’s opening pitch points to a sort of populist political cowardice that sadly abnegates the responsibilities of real leadership, especially when it comes to foreign policy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Here’s the crux of the issue, from her opening statement in <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-11-29/foreign-policy-all">Foreign Affairs</a>: “U.S. trade and economic policies have not delivered for the middle class. … The trade deals(both Democratic and Republican leaders) negotiated mainly lifted the boats of the wealthy while leaving millions of working Americans to drown. Policymakers were willing to sacrifice American jobs in hopes of lowering prices for consumer goods at home and spreading open markets abroad.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Her message is simple: The last few decades of U.S. economic policy abroad have been bad for the median voter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most recently, she opposed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/29/sen-elizabeth-warren-opposes-trumps-nafta-replacement-deal-with-mexico-canada.html">North American Free Trade Agreement 2.0</a>, arguing “Trump’s deal won’t stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes for American workers. It won’t stop outsourcing, it won’t raise wages and it won’t create jobs.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What a tired, pandering and backwards position. Warren, a supposedly wonkish progressive champion, has opened her campaign with a rejection of the international economic order. Warren ignores the indisputable fact that the deals she opposes, such as those which enabled China’s accession to the World Trade Organization, have lifted around a billion people out of extreme poverty in our lifetimes and alleviated untold amounts of human suffering. To Warren, this is an example of big bad politicians helping their rich cronies at the expense of American jobs. How repulsively nativist. I guess it would be one thing if Warren were merely adopting a caricature of the idea that a nation must prioritize its own interests. If there were a substantial economic threat coming from the outside world, she’d at least have a leg to stand on. But she’s wrong about the costs trade imposes on American workers, and I suspect she knows she’s wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">I put enough faith in Warren’s policy chops to believe that her obvious familiarity with “trade shock” literature extends to more than just evidence that trade is bad. It’s like saying she understands that car crashes are bad, but doesn’t understand how cars help people get to work and do other good things. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Here’s the truth: Literally none of the country’s best economists think trade is bad for the country <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/free-trade">on net</a>. And no, there’s not room to resurrect the Warren critique as just reasonable squeamishness about the redistributional effects of trade. For one thing, Warren gave up that ground when she decided to oppose NAFTA 2.0, instead preferring no deal and a worse economy. For another, the changes in the income distribution that have impacted the working class are overwhelmingly the product of a different and far more important macroeconomic trend: the fourth technological revolution. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/worsening-american-income-inequality-is-world-trade-to-blame/">The Brookings Institution</a> calls this “changes in the technology of production.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/upshot/the-long-term-jobs-killer-is-not-china-its-automation.html">The New York Times</a> calls it automation. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Finally, and most importantly, the assertion that major gains from trade do not accrue to the middle and working classes is an oversimplification so egregious that it borders falsehood. If you only look for the costs of trade, you will obviously discover working class job losses concentrated in industries that lose when competing overseas. But these same data and methods can also tell you about working class job gains in industries that get to export and outcompete their foreign counterparts. It turns out that simply adding this dimension to the most prominent studies trumpeting the negative impact of foreign trade shows overall <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/reconsidering-china-shock-trade">modest job creation</a>. Warren is wrong to suggest that CEOs are the sole beneficiaries from trade gains, because opportunity opens up everywhere. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Take NAFTA. The expert consensus is that the agreement has been modestly positive for the U.S. economy. There have been about as many jobs created as lost, and the new jobs pay <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/naftas-impact-u-s-economy-facts">20 percent more</a>. When Warren argues the agreement causes job losses and lower wages, she flies in the face of facts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What makes Warren’s shallow conjuration of an economic boogeyman lurking beyond our borders all the more disappointing is her conspicuous silence on real threats. Outlining her priorities in Foreign Affairs, she mentions China nine times, but only to gently tut at the nation; not once does she discuss the million <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45474279">Uighurs</a> that have been imprisoned in detention camps under the Chinese Communist Party’s latest campaign of ethnic extermination. She doesn’t mention Ukraine, Syria, Yemen, North Korea or any other country that engages in human rights abuses. She bravely and briefly <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-11-29/foreign-policy-all">endorses the review</a> of withdrawing U.S. forces from both Afghanistan and Iraq, as though they were such similar situations that they need not require separate consideration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Look, I get that Warren has thoughts on all of the issues I’m raising. But it matters what issues she chooses to emphasize. I am not satisfied by a “foreign policy” that’s really just bad domestic economic populism in disguise. This isn’t leadership. I sorely hope that the Democratic Party can field a candidate more willing to seriously engage with the president’s principal constitutional responsibilities. No one else in government can be commander-in-chief or <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">negotiate treaties</a>, and so foreign policy is necessarily at the heart of what any candidate signs up for, whether they appear to know it or not. If not, I fear that 2020 will be even more of a vacuous culture war than it has to be. If candidates do the electorate the disrespect of following Trump’s lead into an ever-less intelligent scrap for the approval of some imaginary lowest-common-denominator voter, they will find themselves punished for inauthenticity, leading from behind. To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, we should know by now that wrestling a pig never works. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.</span></p>
