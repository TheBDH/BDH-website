		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Researchers at the School of Public Health compared data from 2011 through<span class="s1"> 2014 to determine the effects of the Affordable Care Act on the number of people covered by health insurance and the quality of care at federally funded community health centers for a study published in the healthcare journal Health Affairs January.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to the study led by Megan Cole GS, a PhD candidate in the School of Public Health, many adults gained access to health insurance under the ACA in 2014 when 25 states and Washington, D.C. e</span>xpanded Medicaid eligibility for low-income and non-elderly individuals. Prior to the ACA, most states did not cover childless adults, Cole said. With the expansion of Medicaid, this population gained coverage along with “persons with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">The goals of extending Medicaid coverage were to “improve access to care for low-income patients who otherwise would not have access to health services and to protect people from large out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare,” Amal Trivedi, associate professor<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of health services, policy and practice, said.</p>
<p class="p2">Before analyzing the data from federally funded community health centers, the researchers developed three main hypotheses. The first hypothesis was that expanded eligibility would increase the proportion of patients with insurance. This hypothesis was based on data in nine states that showed fewer patients who visited health centers after the Medicaid expansion were uninsured. The second hypothesis was that health centers in expansion states would “see an increase in the number of unique patients served, compared to centers in non-expansion states.” Their third hypothesis was that gains in coverage “would translate into improved access to effective primary care, specialty care and prescription drugs for newly insured patients,” which would ultimately improve the quality of care.</p>
<p class="p2">After comparing data from health centers in expansion and non-expansion states, the researchers found their hypotheses held true. “In the states that expanded Medicaid under the (ACA), we observed very large increases in proportion of health center patients with Medicaid coverage and corresponding decreases in the fraction who are uninsured,” Trivedi said. The researchers also found “there was an increase in quality of care in health centers in the Medicaid expansion states,” Trivedi added. “There are a couple reasons for this, one of which might be due to increased insurance revenues to the community health centers.”</p>
<p class="p2">The researchers chose eight measures, such as colorectal cancer screening and diabetes control, to determine the quality of care at the health centers based on recommendations for improvement by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, said Omar Galárraga, assistant professor of health services, policy and practice and co-author of the study. Medicaid expansion ultimately was associated with improved accessibility on four of the eight measures examined: asthma treatment, Pap testing, body mass index assessment and hypertension control.</p>
<p class="p2">The results of the study show that repealing the ACA could result in those currently insured to “lose access to care, which could potentially reverse some of the positive effects that we observed in the first year,” Cole said. Yet it is unclear how expansion of Medicaid under the ACA will be affected by the new presidential administration, Galárraga said.</p>
<p class="p2">“The new administration has v<span class="s1">owed to repeal the ACA. However, they still have not come out with a plan of what they are going to do,” Galárraga said. “If they repeal the law, millions of people will be affected — this is very unfortunate.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New blood clot removal device proven cost-effective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When used with medication, a new stroke treatment cost $23,203 less than treatment with medication alone, according to a new study by University researchers. The new treatment, thrombectomy — a procedure in which a surgeon widens the artery using a “stent retriever” and then draws out the blood clot — was established as cost-effective in a study conducted by a team co-led by Theresa Shireman, professor of health services, policy and practice.</p>
<p class="p2">Strokes, which are often caused by a blood clot in the brain, can have debilitating effects, such as slurred speech and partial paralysis. Doctors must necessarily remove the clot quickly after the stroke occurs, Shireman said. Previously, drugs alone had been used to break apart the clots. But with the advent of thrombectomies, the study co-led by Shireman evaluates a combination of both methods of treatment.</p>
<p class="p2">While this procedure had been proven medically effective during a clinical trial run in 2015, the study conducted by Shireman and her team revealed that the treatment is also cost-effective.</p>
<p class="p2">In order to assess the financial toll of each treatment, Shireman and her team collected data on the costs of treatment while in the hospital 30 days after the treatment and 90 days after the treatment.</p>
<p class="p2">To calculate the costs of the treatment beyond 90 days and complete the study within a reasonable time frame, the authors used a separate group of stroke patients, all of whom were demographically consistent with the group used for the analysis up to 90 days, said Jeffrey Saver, a co-author of the paper and professor of clinical neurology at the University of California at Los Angeles. To analyze the costs after 90 days, the researchers considered factors such as life expectancy, medical costs and daily living expenses. Data were drawn from a variety of national databases to project future costs for patients like those in the study.</p>
<p class="p2">While cost-effective analyses vary case by case, the procedure followed in this study is relatively standard for calculating cost predictions, as the data collected was combined with a long-term model, said Milton Weinstein, professor of health policy and management at Harvard. Not all devices that pass clinical trials are evaluated in a cost-effective analysis like this one, which provides evidence to hospitals and insurance companies that the treatment is economically viable. Though the study was funded by Medtronic — the company that produces the device — the researchers secured academic freedom before pursuing the analysis, Shireman said.</p>
<p class="p2">Saver considers the outcomes of both the clinical trial and cost-effective analysis to be promising. The study proved that the combined treatment is one that not only improves outcomes for patients but also saves the health system money, Saver said, adding that the results were “very gratifying.”</p>
<p class="p2">Shireman furthered that sentiment: “It was really an exciting project to work on. … It’s a project that, at the end of the day, you feel good having been involved in.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics will focus its upcoming semester program on “Singularities and Waves in Incompressible Fluids,” gathering together researchers from across the country to tackle unsolved modeling problems involving phenomena like waves, bubbles and jets. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The program, which includes workshops as well as semester-long collaborations between scholars, is meant to create a space for mathematicians to come together and delve into these topics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The program strives to facilitate progress on the mathematical modeling of waves. The equation that governs the movement of waves ­— known as the “Navier-Stokes Equation” — was established over a hundred years ago, but its applications remain elusive today.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This problem is well-known among mathematicians and has been a source of much scholarly focus, said Govind Menon, professor of applied mathematics and one of the organizers of the semester program. The Clay Mathematics Institute introduced the equation as one of seven Millennium Prize Problems, offering one million dollars for the solution to any of these problems that have stumped mathematicians.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem is well-known worldwide, and mathematicians pursuing the solution to the Navier-Stokes equation often work at different locations. By bringing people together in the same space, the program aims to improve communication. “No one in my department works on waves, so I’m very happy to be here. I’m expecting to get a lot of work done and … get new ideas,” said Diane Henderson, professor of mathematics at Pennsylvania State University and one of the organizers of the program.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, there are three ways by which researchers attempt to solve the problem of modeling waves: analytically, using mathematical techniques;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>computationally, using computer simulations and experimentally, using wave pools and other equipment, said Baylor Fox-Kemper, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The semester program aims to bring together people using each method so that the mathematicians can draw on each other, Henderson said. “It’s really wonderful to have people using all three methods come together. It makes all the difference in the world,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Researchers can also suggest papers and techniques for other mathematicians, Menon said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While waves attract interest from many mathematicians, many scientists are intrigued by the topic as well. Fox-Kemper is interested in the semester program because he hopes it will enable him to create more accurate models of waves. He uses wave models to predict carbon flow into and out of the earth’s atmosphere and then applies this data to help model climate change.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Additionally, the semester program will focus on other unsolved problems relating to incompressible fluids, such as bubbles and jets, which are difficult to model mathematically, said Walter Strauss, professor of mathematics and the main organizer of the program.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Overall, 120 people will participate in the semester program, according to the program’s website. Strauss has high hopes for what the group might achieve: “Something really might come out of (the program) by communication from the different viewpoints,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Indicated by the many awards earned by faculty and former students, the computer science department has recently demonstrated its ability to attract high-achieving students and equip them with valuable skills for their work in fields ranging from artificial intelligence to embedded smart vision systems. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Assistant Professor of Computer Science George Konidaris received an Air Force of Scientific Research Young Investigator Research Award in November for his research on artificial intelligence. He described his work as “getting robots to think abstractly.” The goal is to allow robots to “hallucinate abstractions of the world that allow them to make very fast, intelligent decisions,” Konidaris said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Konidaris was drawn to artificial intelligence because it seeks to answer “one of the most mysterious things in the world: … What is it that makes intelligence possible?” he said. Robotics particularly appealed to him because it seemed the most natural analogue to human behavior — if the brain acts as a computer, the body can be represented by a robot, he said. “It could add tremendous value to the world,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Foreign Policy Magazine listed Assistant Professor of Computer Science Stefanie Tellex and John Oberlin GS as two of its 2016 Leading Global Thinkers. Placed on the list’s “Innovators” category, Tellex and Oberlin were recognized for their work in robotic grasping and robot learning. For their research, the pair used an industrial robot named Baxter, which uses cameras and infrared sensors to examine objects and determine the best clutches for them. Tellex also won a NASA Early Career Faculty Award in August for her research in human-robot collaboration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For his work with reconfigurable computing and smart vision systems embedded in other devices, Associate Professor of Engineering and Computer Science Sherief Reda was named as one of the Providence Journal’s 2017 Rhode Island Innovators. The Rhode Island Innovators “are finding new ways to develop products, devices, applications, computer models, methods and policies that are solving problems in business, education, the arts, government and health care,” the Providence Journal reported.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another success in the field includes Hoon Ik Chang ’13, a computer science alum who currently works for the Korean Minister of National Defense. Chang was recently named a 2018 Schwarzman Scholar, which allows him to participate in a program that provides funding for students to pursue a one-year master’s degree at Tsinghua University in Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Tom Doeppner, vice chair of the computer science department, attributes the department’s success to its focus on<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>undergraduate programs in addition to research. “When we hire new faculty, we want to make sure that our new faculty are not just great researchers but also very interested in teaching,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Likewise, Chair and Professor of Computer Science Ugur Cetintemel said that the goal was to “give the best education to our students, and also … take steps that keep us competitive and at the leading edge of innovation.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cetintemel identified the people in the department as one of the fundamental factors contributing to its success: “We start with great material — great students and great faculty,” he said. “They are people who care about making an impact.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cetintemel and Doeppner both pointed to the intimacy of the computer science community and the faculty’s investment in students as additional elements crucial to the department’s strength. The faculty strives to involve students in the department, Doeppner added, specifically highlighting their extensive undergraduate teaching assistant program.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We are close with (our students) and try to nurture them to the best of our ability,” Cetintemel added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Konidaris joined Brown’s computer science department in Fall 2016. “It’s a tremendous department, really full of enormously supportive people. Everybody tries to help others do their best work,” he said. While Brown and the department itself may be small compared to competing institutions, “every member of the department is truly the best in their field,” Konidaris added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Centintemel emphasized the importance of prioritizing student work and providing an outlet for pushing forward their findings. Not only do faculty members work to identify opportunities for students, but once students have achieved success, Brown faculty work with people in the computer science community to nominate them for awards, Cetintemel said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s the saying — if you don’t take the shot you’ll always miss it,” Cetintemel said. “It’s one thing to do great work, but it’s also very important to make sure the world recognizes the great work you’ve done.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The computer science department hopes to continue developing, in terms of research, innovation and representation. “Simply in the last couple years, we have grown in the areas of cybersecurity, robotics, computation design and photography,” Cetintemel said, adding that </span><span class="s2">“as is definitely the case in all departments in the University, we are working on getting more faculty from underrepresented minorities.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students from the top 1 percent of the national income distribution attended Brown at roughly the same proportion as students from the bottom 60 percent from 2006 to 2013, according to a new study from the Equality of Opportunity Project titled “Mobility Report Cards: The Role of Colleges in Intergenerational Mobility.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The researchers analyzed “rosters of attendance at all Title IV accredited institutions of higher education in the United States using de-identified data from federal income tax returns” and the National Student Loan Data System, said John Friedman, associate professor of economics and international and public affairs, as well as one of the study’s investigators. The data covers students born between 1980 and 1991, which roughly corresponds to the graduating classes of 2002 to 2013. Because the University only collects financial information on students receiving financial aid, findings of the study were previously unknown to University administrators, said President Christina Paxson P’19.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From roughly the class of 2002 to the class of 2013, the percentage of students from families in the bottom 60 percent of the income distribution increased from 13.2 percent to 18.2 percent, according to the study. Over the same period, the proportion of students from families in the top 1 percent stayed consistent at around 16 to 19 percent. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We thought, 20 years ago, that becoming need-blind was going to solve the problem (of disparity in student income backgrounds),” Paxson said. “I think the problem is more deeply embedded in society. The issue for us is not who we admit among those who are in our pool, but who’s in our pool — who’s applying to Brown.” She added that students’ opportunities are often tied to those of their parents.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friedman said the overwhelming percentage of students from high-income families at Brown “is a statement about the differences in opportunities that kids from different types of families have in the United States.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The goal of the Equality of Opportunity Project is to “understand the pathways for upward mobility for kids from low-income families,” Friedman said. In the study, mobility was measured as the percentage of the student body with parents in the bottom quintile that reach the top income quintile by their early thirties, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A little over 53 percent of Brown students with parents in the bottom quintile of the income distribution reached the top quintile, according to data for students born between 1980 and 1982. This is nearly the same rate as Brown students with parents in the top quintile — 59 percent of them also reached the top quintile.</span></p>
[infogram id="0f185539-2587-4de9-aad3-ccafc57c473f" prefix="ziz"]
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But because Brown enrolls such a small proportion of low-income students, the University is not an effective creator of upward mobility, Friedman said. Colleges with higher rates of economic mobility “tend to be mid-tier, selective, public universities,” he said. The California State University, State University of New York and City University of New York systems have some of the highest mobility rates in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“If you think about what’s a scalable national model in how to improve higher education (and increase mobility), trying to make a lot of schools look like Brown … is not going to be a successful model,” Friedman said. “Trying to get a lot of schools to look like Cal State … is more feasible.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Paxson agreed that the University’s model could not be brought to scale. Many of the schools that Friedman finds to create high mobility “are not research universities,” she said. “So our missions are very different.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In recent years, the University has taken some steps to reduce income disparity in the student body and support low-income students. Brown adopted a need-blind admissions policy beginning with the class of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>2007. Additionally, the First-Generation and Low-Income Student Center <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/19/first-gen-low-income-student-center-unveiled/">opened</a> in September 2016. Paxson said that the center may help attract more students from low-income families “if Brown continues to build its reputation as a welcoming and supportive place for students from all economic backgrounds.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Yolanda Rome, co-director of the FLIC and dean of the college, said the focus of the center is to create “community during students’ time at Brown,” rather than to recruit students from low-income backgrounds or participate in admissions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University is not yet prepared to significantly increase the population of students from low-income backgrounds, Paxson said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Such planning would require more funding for financial aid. While total University scholarships increased from $24.8 million in 1998 to $117 million in 2017, the average scholarship increased from $12,700 — about $18,000 when adjusted for inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator, to $41,792 this year, according to data given to The Herald by Paxson. The University also does not offer strong financial aid packages for middle-income students, Paxson said. The University is currently trying to raise half a billion dollars to fund financial aid, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The findings of the study are a “wake-up call,” Paxson said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For the most part we’ve gone from being behind our peers (in the Ivy League in terms of economic diversity) to being in line with our peers,” Paxson said. “But that doesn’t mean we are where we need to be. We know we have more work to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><strong>Correction: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article stated that President Christina Paxson P'19 had said that "<span class="s1">the schools that Friedman finds to create high mobility 'are not research universities.'" In fact, she said that most of the schools Friedman finds to create high mobility "are not research universities." The Herald regrets the error.</span></strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University researchers focus on needs of veteran amputees</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">University researchers are collaborating on a three-year study focused on the needs of veterans who have suffered severe upper-limb amputations. The study is being led by Linda Resnik, professor of health services, policy and practice and researcher at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Resnik and her team of researchers aim to acquire data on veterans by evaluating their day-to-day functioning and learn more about their experiences with prosthetics, Resnik said. Data collection will consist of surveys and performance tests, and subjects will be evaluated yearly, she said. The surveys are being developed in collaboration with Melissa Clark, adjunct professor of epidemiology at Brown as well as professor of quantitative health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, “nationally representative data” about veterans with upper-limb amputations is lacking, Resnik said. Prior studies that have examined upper-limb amputees have targeted “small samples” or have not been conducted in the United States, Resnik added. Her study is unique, as it draws upon a large sample base and utilizes medical data from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Technological advances in upper-limb prosthetics have “lagged behind” those made in lower-limb prosthetics due to the complexity of replacing an upper limb and re-establishing its many functions. Those with upper-limb amputations abandon their prostheses more often than those with lower-limb amputations because they are unhappy with their devices, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Because fewer individuals have upper-limb amputations than lower-limb amputations, there are fewer experts in the field who can provide quality care, Resnik added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most upper-limb amputations in veterans are caused by “blast injuries” that are sustained in combat, while lower-limb amputations are usually a result of a “disease process” like diabetes or poor blood circulation, said Joseph Webster, a collaborator on the project and medical director of the Veterans Health Administration Amputation System of Care.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sarah Ekerholm, project coordinator, said she “will be providing oversight” in order to ensure that data collection is standardized across sites.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There are lots of moving pieces and a lot of people we need to keep in the loop to ensure work is getting done,” Ekerholm said. “Developing relationships and having open communication (with the other sites) is really important.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Resnik’s goal is for the study’s findings to be “used to improve the quality of care” for these amputees, she said. The findings could also be used to improve prosthetic designs and rehabilitation programs, Webster said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The study is funded by the United States Department of Defense’s Orthotics and Prosthetics Outcomes Research Program, according to the Providence Journal. To conduct the study, Resnik will be collaborating with the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio as well as Veterans Affairs medical centers in Florida, Virginia and Washington, according to the Journal. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How does morality work in the brain? How do we choose between altruism and self-interest? These are questions that the new multidisciplinary FeldmanHall Lab seeks to answer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What started in August 2016 with the arrival of Oriel FeldmanHall, assistant professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences, FeldmanHall Lab focuses on three main topics: the self and other, moral cognition and social learning and emotion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lab studies questions about the processes involved in common thoughts and actions, delving into how we prioritize our own interests compared to those of others, FeldmanHall said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">FeldmanHall Lab’s work marks a paradigm shift from most research conducted in this domain, which has been more philosophical and focused on normative behavior, she said. Previously, research has focused on how people should behave, whereas her research investigates how people actually respond to situations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Research Laboratory Manager Jae-Young Son is currently conducting this type of research on the issue of restorative justice — compensation after enduring some wrongdoing — compared to retributive justice — seeking revenge. “We find that if you give people the option … they prefer restorative options overall,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">FeldmanHall often draws upon the Rwandan genocide between of the Tutsi people by the Hutu to exemplify this kind of decision-making.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“After civil war, people in the same society have to learn to get back together and unite after so much hatred has been exchanged,” Son said. “What people have found is that people do forgive — you get victims to come together with perpetrators.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lab uses economic games to simplify decision-making problems, Son said. “The beauty is that … they mimic real-life scenarios in a laboratory way.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One game involved in Son’s research is the ultimatum game, in which player A can offer player B a portion of their money, and player B can choose either to accept it or reject it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The scenario becomes more complex when two more options are introduced — compensate and reverse. If player B chooses to compensate, B’s monetary payment is increased to match A’s. If B chooses to reverse, the monetary payments are switched.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The researchers observed that when people played the game on their own behalf, they chose to compensate more than reverse. But when playing on someone else’s behalf, they chose to reverse more often. “When we observe injustices being done (to) other people, we apply abstract norms that we are more likely to uphold,” Son said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Joseph Heffner GS added that part of their work is focused on identifying the contexts in which people value compensation as opposed to punishment. In cases where people prefer punishment, Heffner said a possible reason is that “punishment has a great reputational advantage. When you’re known as the person to stand up and pay the price to punish perpetrators, you’re imbued with a good moral status.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">FeldmanHall said she was drawn to studying these concepts based upon her training in college and experience working in the Senate following her graduation. Combining those two experiences together spurred her to ask questions about social decision making and learning — morality, fairness, altruism, cooperation and pro-social behavior.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lab specializes in the field of social and affective neuroscience<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— or using neuroscience techniques to gain cognitive insights on questions taken from social psychology, Son said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There are people who do neuroscience and cognition, people who do social psychology and people who do behavioral economics, but our lab is somewhat unique in that we blend all these techniques together and use them to investigate questions about moral cognition,” Son added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This merging of disciplines makes the lab stand out, FeldmanHall said. “Some of the most interesting research happens at the fringes of multiple different fields. It allows you to approach a question from a number of different angles.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Speed of speech unrelated to amount of information conveyed</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether we speak lightning fast or at snail speed, the amount of information we convey is about the same, according to new University research. In a recent study published in the journal Cognition, Uriel Cohen Priva, assistant professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences, investigated the relationship between speed of speech and the rate of information a person conveys when speaking.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Priva based his research on previous findings regarding speech rates in local contexts. “We’ve known for a while that language is a communication channel and, as such, … we try not to provide too much information at any one time,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Simple phrases such as “salt and pepper” illustrate this effect. The word “pepper” is likely to have a shorter duration when preceded by “salt and” rather than “sugar and.” This is because the phrase “sugar and pepper” provides new or unexpected information, while “pepper” in the context of “salt and pepper” is predictable, according to the research.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Edward Gibson, professor of cognitive science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found in the past that across languages, words “are shorter when they’re more predictable from the local context.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While previous studies focused on the length of individual words or sounds, Priva applied this inquiry to global contexts “where we know that some people speak faster than others,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Priva used two main data sets in his research: the Switchboard Corpus, composed of 2,400 ten-minute telephone conversations about an assigned conversation topic, and the Buckeye Corpus, composed of 40 nearly hour-long conversations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In order to quantitatively analyze speech, Priva defined linguistic information using two metrics: lexical information, the rarity or complexity of words used, and syntactic information, measured through usage of the passive voice, which is a less frequently used sentence structure.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Priva found that faster speakers tended to use more common words and less complex sentence structures, while slower speakers used rarer words and more complex syntax. This finding was surprising in that it “does not agree with the tacit assumption that we first choose what we say and then we modify our speech to fit that,” he said. “Instead, it would seem that how fast we speak dictates what we say.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This outcome raises the question of who is responsible for the limitations of communication, Priva said. “Is it the speaker who is more or less likely to produce content-full language in a given timeframe, or the listener who’s forced to understand what they’re being told fast enough?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Doria Charlson GS, a teaching assistant for TAPS 0220: “Persuasive Communication,” which is primarily taught by Senior Lecturer in Theatre Arts and Performance Studies Barbara Tannenbaum, said these findings were consistent with the listener-centered approach taught in persuasive communication. “In eliminating (filler) words and using shorter sentences that have more precise meaning, what you say … has more of an impact for the audience,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to the possible relevance of Priva’s finding in learning to communicate more effectively, Gibson suggested potential engineering applications, such as when designing natural user interfaces. In video games or other examples of artificial intelligence, “if you’re trying to simulate real humans, you want to have this kind of bottleneck in your interactions,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the general relationship observed between speech rate and information rate is likely universal across languages, Priva added that “current research finds differences between old people and young people and (between) men and women. It’s at least possible that these are specific to the socio-linguistic facts of American English.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Upon statistical analysis, data from male and female speakers illustrated that male speakers, in general, conveyed more information in the same number of words as women, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Priva gave several potential explanations for this disparity. “Because we have zero reason to assume that men are more capable in language use, (what) I believe is driving the effect is that men and women do speak differently and that’s a socio-linguistic fact about … power,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One manifestation of that difference is that women tend to backchannel — use words such as “uh huh” or “okay” that indicate they understood what was said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Women also tend to hedge more. “Instead of directly saying there’s a problem, they would say, ‘I think there’s a problem’ or ‘maybe there’s a problem,”’ Priva said, adding that this also “has to do with power.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s something that’s the result of culture and socialization,” Charlson said. “Society teaches heteronormative male power. We’re interested in evening out the playing field (for those) who don’t have that kind of power.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“As (Tannenbaum) always says: ‘Men have to be credible. Women have to be credible and likeable,’” Charlson added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An analysis of past temperatures on Mount Kenya suggests that current climate models used to study climate change may not be as accurate as previously thought, according to a paper published in January by University researchers in the journal Science Advances.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By comparing lake sediment cores from Lake Rutundu on the top of Mount Kenya to temperature data from lower elevations, climate researchers showed that mountaintop temperatures increased more than temperatures at lower elevations since the last ice age — about 20,000 years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A comparison of these findings to past climates simulated by climate models showed that such models “significantly underestimate high-elevation temperature changes,” said Jim Russell, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences and an author of the study. Such underestimation could lead to errors in predicting future effects of climate change and global warming, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“People talk a lot about how sensitive and fragile mountain ecosystems are … and yet there’s really not that much data out there” to show that they are more susceptible to climate change, Russell said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Organic compounds found in these sediment cores provide a proxy for temperature, and the depth at which they were found indicate the period they were produced. “All cells have some sort of cell membrane. But bacteria and archaea actually change their structure based on temperature,” said Shannon Loomis PhD’13, lead author of the study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These organisms produce molecules that maintain their cell membrane fluidity in low temperatures, and these molecules can survive in the sediment for thousands of years, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We extract these compounds from the sediment and then measure their relative abundances,” Russell said. The relative abundance of different types of molecules found in the cell wall of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the bacteria correlates to a temperature at a specific time in the past. Tiny differences in the makeup of these compounds, such as the addition of a carbon chain, can give meaningful data about past climates.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Similar studies conducted by Russell’s lab have “observed temperature changes of around two to three degrees” in low-elevation African lakes since the last ice age, Russell said. Slightly higher elevations — around 2,000 meters above sea level — showed temperature increases of around five degrees. At Lake Rutundu — around 3,000 meters above sea level — the researchers observed a temperature increase of about six degrees over the same amount of time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“What (these findings) mean is that over the past 20,000 years, temperatures have warmed more at high elevations than at low elevations,” Loomis said. This phenomenon of greater temperature change at higher altitudes is called a “lapse rate.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Models that attempt to simulate the climate during the last ice age incorporate a lapse rate, but not one as steep as the rate Russell’s team found in the study. “These are exactly the same models used to predict how the climate will be a hundred years from now,” Russell said. “The models all underestimated the temperature changes at high elevation” compared to what the data indicate, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When we think about the climate problem, we really only have 130 (to) 150 years of observations,” said Baylor Fox-Kemper, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences who was unaffiliated with the study. “What this paper shows is that our guesses — what the climate models do — are not as sensitive as the real system.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Alison Field, director of the Centers for Epidemiology and Environmental Health and chair of epidemiology, began working on the Growing Up Today Study in 1996, almost 17,000 children aged 9 to 14 enrolled. But as the study, which looks at the effects of diet and exercise on weight changes throughout a person’s life, progressed, she found that at around age 18, boys began dropping out of the study at higher rates than girls, which hurt the quality of the study’s results. To make matters worse, the researchers could not figure out how to improve the response rate of boys. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And now? “We haven’t gotten any firm answer,” Field said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Field’s problems are not unique: The struggle to obtain representative population samples continues to plague researchers. “Across the board, it is getting harder and harder to get people to return surveys in academia,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those from low-income backgrounds pose an especially difficult challenge. Middle- and upper-class families are more likely to have the time and means to participate in studies, increasing their response rates, Field said. And it’s sometimes difficult to track down low-resource individuals due to high mobility rates.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Minorities can be difficult to reach as well, particularly in randomized trials, said Ira Wilson, professor and chair of health services, policy and practice. Surveys that are meant to reach a wide spectrum of people often do not, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since researchers have faced increasing difficulties reaching certain populations, they have adopted a variety of methods to account for uneven representation in samples and improve participation rates in research studies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Answers may be weighted to adjust for lower-than-expected response rates, said Joseph Hogan, professor of biostatistics and public health. As a result, an individual’s answer from a population with a low response rate will be counted more heavily than an answer from a better-represented population.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Additionally, researchers have increasingly turned to community engagement, a new type of research that focuses on participation and involvement from the local population.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the last decade or so, researchers have looked to the community to discuss what issues should be studied, Wilson said. Researchers ask locals to take part in the research team as well, where they can encourage involvement and ensure that the study is relevant to the community. “If the community doesn’t know why something is being done, they might not be interested. It might be quite hard to enroll people in the study,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wilson has been able to increase response rates to his studies through his use of community engagement, meaning that fewer groups are left out of research studies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Amy Nunn, associate professor of medicine and behavioral and social sciences, strongly advocates for community engagement research. “I’ve always found it to be rewarding and worthwhile. It’s the only way I do my work,” she said. Nunn has used the process while researching and creating programs for the Rhode Island Public Health Institute, including Food on the Move, which provides mobile, discounted food markets in a variety of neighborhoods, and Do One Thing, which addresses issues faced by those with HIV.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But community engagement does not come without problems. “One of the big challenges that researchers have is that they don’t know how to engage people in research studies,” Nunn said. The process is extremely time consuming as well, forcing researchers to deeply understand the community being studied, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nunn spends a significant amount of time reaching out to locals, listening to their issues and working with them while conducting her research. “Sometimes that’s at the expense of my more academic responsibilities,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite these challenges, Nunn and Wilson believe that community engagement is key to the future of research studies that involve a human component. “Sometimes it’s easy to lose sight of the issues,” Nunn said. “But if you focus on what communities need and tailor your grants accordingly, then you usually don’t go wrong.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ken Miller ’70 talks politics of science denial</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">As part of the “Reaffirming University Values: Campus Dialogue and Discourse” series, Professor of Biology Ken Miller ’70 examined science denial Thursday, discussing the scientific facts and theories people often disagree with despite overwhelming supporting evidence, such as climate change, vaccinations, genetically modified organisms and evolution. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Miller highlighted the political aspect of science denial throughout his talk, noting that people deny scientific facts on both sides of the political spectrum.“Why is it (that) depicting yourself as anti-science has become a viable political strategy?” Miller asked the audience. “Science is powerful. Science can be misused by people on the right and people on the left.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Miller argued that on the left, some politicians use scientific denial to impose regulation, while on the right, some use it to oppose regulation. For example, despite overwhelming evidence that GMOs are not harmful to humans, those to the left of the political spectrum call for a ban or regulation of them. Those on the right use a similar denial tactic regarding climate change, despite extensive evidence proving its existence. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In order to fight science denial, Miller proposed a number of solutions. “The reflexive way that most of us in science want to overcome science denial is with a torrent of facts,” he said. But Miller argued against this path, citing studies that show people often become more firm in their opinions when flooded with evidence that contradicts their beliefs. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Winning people over to science isn’t a matter of facts — it’s a matter of identity,” Miller said. High school teachers, he suggested, should be used as a model for getting people to feel like they are part of the scientific community.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Miller also promoted integrating science into popular culture. He cited the Big Bang Theory and Neil deGrasse Tyson as effective communicators of science and enthusiastic promoters of the scientific pursuit of knowledge. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Miller discussed a number of values that universities should promote as well, such as embracing an “open intellectual culture under which science thrives” and presenting science not just as “a technology but as a genuine liberal art.” A university should also encourage both STEM and humanities students to reach outside of their discipline and expand their breadth of knowledge, he said. “To be ignorant of science is as profound of an intellectual gap as to be ignorant of the literature or the history of our country and its people,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The event was open to the public and attended by a number of students and professors. Attendee Willoughby Britton, assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior, said she felt that Miller’s speech ran counter to the other “Reaffirming University Values” lectures because he promoted science as an existing power structure while other lectures have sought to fight existing power structures. “People think that science is an incumbent power structure and feel oppressed by it. (The lecture gave the) complete opposite message than we’re getting from all of the other talks.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kristina Eichel GS noted that educational strategies from Germany, where she received her education, allow students to personally interact with scientists more often and could help build relationships with the scientific community. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After the event, Miller described his desire to speak to the Brown community. Speaking to the community is “important because you really want to motivate people to … stand up for science in the university community and also in the real world,” he told The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To summarize his points, Miller concluded, “The key to winning acceptance of science in the political and economic sphere … is to let people know this is the most exciting time in the history of science and all of us, whether we are professional scientists or not, are and can be a part of it.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“How can you create black scientists if there’s no black scientific community?” asked William Massey, professor of operations research and financial engineering at Princeton, during this week’s “Celebrating Excellence in Science” event.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hosted by the Science Center, this two-day lecture event aimed to foster greater representation for minorities in STEM fields as part of the University’s recognition of Black History Month. Consisting of a lecture from engineer and inventor Dr. James West and a panel of scientists from research institutions across the country, the event was a continuation of the “Seeing Myself in Science” speaker series.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Director of the Science Center Gelonia Dent said in her introduction, “The idea is that we want to bring a diverse set of scientists to Brown to share their expertise and advice about diversity, inclusion and excellence.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">West, a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Johns Hopkins University, gave a lecture Tuesday on his work in acoustical science, which led to the development of technology now used in 90 percent of all contemporary microphones.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beyond his scientific discoveries, West is perhaps equally renowned for his work in supporting minorities in science, technology and engineering. During his forty-year career at Bell Laboratories, West co-founded several programs aimed at providing mentoring and funding for underrepresented minorities studying science, including the Association of Black Laboratory Employees.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wednesday, the Science Center hosted “How to Grow a Scientist” — a panel of scientists from top research centers across the United States — to discuss mentorship, diversity and inclusion in STEM. All of the panelists had worked at Bell Labs during their respective careers and cited the laboratory as a catalyst to their success as minorities in STEM.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The panelists included Benjamin Askew, vice president of research at SciFluor Life Sciences, LLC; Kaye Fealing, chair of the School of Public Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology; and William Wilson, executive director of the Center for Nanoscale Systems at Harvard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fealing prefaced her discussion of “How to Grow a Scientist” by distancing herself from the pipeline model for including more minorities in STEM, which emphasizes early involvement in science for minorities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I don’t like the pipeline metaphor,” she said. “It sounds like there are no other ways of ‘getting in’ unless you get on the train early in life.” While Fealing herself had participated in a diversity-focused program like some in Bell Labs, she highlighted multiple pathways to STEM involvement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rather than identifying a program in which students should participate or a specific timeline for students to follow, Fealing pinpointed the broader needs for information, communication, scalability, sustainability and leadership. She cited mentorship and support from her family as instrumental to her personal success.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Likewise, Massey emphasized mentoring as key to expanding representation for minorities. “This is where it starts — bringing in the next generation,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Everyone’s talking about pipelines, and no one’s talking about plumbing,” Massey said. “How do you connect those people who’ve gone through the pipeline?”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Instead, Massey said that scientists should focus on building community. Wilson also spoke to creating an environment where young scientists can make connections and collaborate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wilson said that he strives to achieve that kind of community at the Center of Nanoscale Systems, where he encourages his students to build upon a diverse and versatile array of research resources to tackle cutting-edge nanoscience research questions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Echoing the words of William Baker, former president of Bell Labs, Wilson described his vision for his lab: “I’m going to build an ecosystem for doing science. We’re going to let people build science from within.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Researchers study smokers’ perceptions of reduced nicotine cigarettes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past several years, researchers have tried to understand smokers’ perceptions of what they are putting into their bodies. A group of researchers led by Rachel Denlinger-Apte PhD’21 investigated how smokers expected low-nicotine cigarettes to affect their health. Participants rated the low-nicotine cigarettes as less satisfying but also less dangerous than average-nicotine cigarettes, according to the researchers’ article, published in Nicotine and Tobacco Research January 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In previous studies that have explored smokers’ perception of reduced-nicotine cigarettes, subjects were not aware of the nicotine content. As a result, little is known about how smokers experience reduced-nicotine cigarettes when they are actually aware of the reduced content and how this knowledge may impact their use of these cigarettes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The researchers hypothesized that the low-nicotine cigarettes would be perceived by smokers as “less risky” and would be rated as less desirable than normal-nicotine-content cigarettes. But “the (low-nicotine cigarette) itself is not less dangerous” because smokers still inhale toxic chemicals, Denlinger-Apte said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To test their theory, the researchers recruited smokers in the Pittsburgh community aged 18 years or older who have smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day for the past year. Each participant was given two cigarettes in unmarked envelopes and was instructed to smoke them one at a time. “Both were very low-nicotine cigarettes, but for one cigarette, we said that it was low-nicotine. … For the other, we said that it was average nicotine,” Denlinger-Apte said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Independent of the actual nicotine content but dependent on how the product was framed, participants “thought the (low-nicotine) product was less harmful” and less pleasurable to smoke than the cigarettes they regularly smoked.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Given that (very low-nicotine-content cigarettes) might become useful as a step toward quitting smoking, the Denlinger-Apte study addressed the question of how acceptable (the cigarettes) might be to smokers,” said Damaris Rohsenow, associate director of the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, who was unaffiliated with the study. “While participants rated the (very low-nicotine cigarettes) as less rewarding than their usual cigarettes, they also believed (they) would be less harmful to their health. (But they) are actually likely to be just as harmful to health since people are still exposed to carbon monoxide, tar and particles in the smoke.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">From these results, the researchers ultimately learned that “people confound or confuse nicotine with harm,” said Eric Donny, professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh and co-author of the study. “If you tell them (the cigarette) has less nicotine, they think that the cigarette is likely to be less harmful to them … and obviously that would be concerning if people kept smoking because of this.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The findings of this study have significant implications when it comes to the Food and Drug Administration’s future policies. Jennifer Tidey, professor of psychiatry and human behavior, who was unaffiliated with the study, said the way the FDA frames the cigarette product will be important. “If the FDA proceeds with a reduced-nicotine standard for cigarettes sold in the United States, it will be extremely important that they use educational campaigns to inform smokers that they need to significantly reduce their smoking or quit completely in order to reduce the health risks associated with smoking,” she said. “Smoking very low-nicotine-content cigarettes does not by itself reduce the risks of smoking.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New study reveals extent of colonial native enslavement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Enslavement of Native Americans is often overlooked in historical research, and a new study by Associate Professor of History Linford Fisher shows the problem in colonial New England reaches further than previously assumed. Published in January’s issue of Ethnohistory, Fisher’s research examining native enslavement during and after King Philip’s War reveals that many Native Americans were coerced into surrendering — for fear of punishment or in response to promises of neutrality — but were enslaved regardless.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Many of those enslaved were not actually combatants but refugees trying to get away from violence,” said Margaret Newell, professor of history at Ohio State University.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“People who wanted to be neutral were assigned a limited term of enslavement, for 10 to 30 years. It’s all right there in the colony records,” Fisher added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fisher first began investigating the scope of Native American enslavement when he came across church records while conducting research for a previous book project. Documentation of baptisms revealed that ministers of the church commonly owned two or three Native American slaves, Fisher said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He said that the transparency of testimonies and government documents took him by surprise. “I was shocked by the lack of embarrassment or sense of moral justice,” Fisher said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the extent of Native American slavery appears only to have recently surfaced, this information has been accessible for a long time, Fisher said. “The field has known this for a while, we just haven’t done the hard work of fully understanding it.” The previous assumption was that this slavery occurred on a relatively limited scale.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And yet, evidence now indicates that the estimated number of Native American slaves falls between 2.5 and five million. Considering that the number of African slaves transported across the Atlantic was around 12.5 million, the extent of Native American slavery was comparable in size, said Andres Resendez, professor of history at the University of California at Davis.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Part of the difficulty in quantifying this phenomenon lies in the availability of evidence, Newell said. “People were being enslaved domestically, illegally and informally. It’s hard to reconstruct, compared to countable cargoes of African slaves in the trans-Atlantic slave trade.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Resendez added that African slaves were concentrated on plantations and widely accepted by governing powers, whereas Native American slaves were traded secretly after the Spanish made slavery illegal. Thus the enslavement of native people was less documented and therefore less well-known today.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Resendez explained that, like the African slave trade, Native American enslavement not only manifested domestically but also through exportation. “The Caribbean was a big magnet for enslaved native labor, so it’s not only English colonies selling natives to the Caribbean, but also Spanish colonists doing exactly the same thing — enslaving people from the Gulf of Mexico coast or the northern coast of South America and selling them to the Caribbean islands,” he said. Fisher described this system as a “reversed Middle Passage.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite the magnitude of Native American enslavement, significant historical research has only surfaced in this area in the past two decades, Fisher said. Outside of the historical community, the impact and prevalence of Native American slavery is even less well-known.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There might be little snippets of information that come through maybe regionally, but I think it hasn’t made its way into our … national narrative,” Fisher said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a result, Fisher is building a public database for the documentation of Native American slavery. “The idea is that there’ll be a crowdsourced database for every indigenous person who’s ever been enslaved in the Americas,” Fisher explained.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This comes at a time when Americans are trying to take control of their history more and more,” Newell said. “It’s not just the great families and the merchants who dominate the story.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Paralysis patients achieve fastest typing yet with new brain-computer interface</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even simple communication is a constant struggle for paralyzed patients, but a collaborative project from BrainGate neurotechnology researchers, which included scientists from Brown, recently found a way for these patients to type at the fastest speeds achieved yet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Imagined actions, such as moving a cursor across an on-screen keyboard and selecting a letter, have become a reality for paralyzed patients with the help of a brain-computer interface. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Researchers implanted a tiny array of 100 electrodes in the brain so only the top of a silver plug was visible outside the patient’s skull. These electrodes recorded the firing of certain cells inside the brain and sent the information through a series of wires and connectors to reach a decoder — a computer system that interprets the information, said Leigh Hochberg ’90, professor of engineering.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The most recent data from the ongoing research shows that typing assisted by brain-computer interfaces is approaching speeds that would be useful for the public, Hochberg said. For patients who cannot move or speak, “even the ability to say yes or no is meaningful communication,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The three subjects were able to type at 1.4 to 4.2 times the speeds previously achieved by paralysis patients using similar systems, according to the study. With the interface, one subject reached a typing speed of nearly eight words per minute. All three typed at rates of about 2.5 words per minute, wrote Chethan Pandarinath, postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University and lead author of the study, in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though these typing speeds are the fastest yet, they remain “painfully slow,” said Elizabeth Tyler-Kabara, director of the Neural Enhancement Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh. Predictive typing systems, like those that complete your words and phrases as you text, might increase those speeds dramatically, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence could also enhance the interfaces, allowing for more natural control, Pandarinath wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The interface is not yet a marketable device, said Paul Nuyujukian, director of the Brain Interfacing Laboratory at Stanford and co-author of the study. The interface needs to be able to work anywhere, without wires or a trained technician, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Still, this increase in typing speed is “a hugely significant increase,” said Michael Boninger, vice chair for research at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “There’s no doubt that this brain-computer interface work has the ability to be transformative.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Researchers in multiple locations across the country have engaged in human research with this implanted chip since around 2004, Hochberg said. More recently, the team developed algorithms for the decoder that allowed subjects to point and click on a screen, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">BrainGate researchers and other experts not involved with the project noted the study’s reliance on the research participants. Through their generous feedback about the device, they allow scientists to help more people with paralysis in the future, Hochberg said.</span></p>

		<title>Nonprofit sends used prosthetics to patients in Vietnam</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If a war veteran in Vietnam seeks to buy a prosthetic leg, he will often be met with disappointment. Prosthetics in Vietnam typically cost upwards of $2,000, and the average annual income in Vietnam is around $1,700. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Seeing the difficult life that amputees faced around her hometown of Ho Chi Minh City, Trang Duong ’18 decided to help reduce the cost of providing care for amputees.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Duong, along with her co-founder Victor Wang, an undergraduate at Yale, started Penta, an organization that brings donated prosthetics from the United States to Vietnam, where they are refitted for amputees. Penta charges $200 for this process, a more than tenfold reduction in cost.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In order to get supplies, Penta collects prosthetics from clinics as well as from individuals. Used prosthetics cannot be reused or resold within the United States, forcing clinics and individuals to hold onto their old ones, Duong said. This creates an essentially free supply of prosthetics that would otherwise cost thousands of dollars to purchase. While the organization is currently focusing on clinics in Connecticut and Rhode Island, it hopes to expand its partnerships to clinics around the country. Wang — who focuses on the U.S. operations for Penta — said that the nonprofit hopes to streamline the process and expand options for individuals to donate through the website.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When individuals donate to Penta, they are able to track the prosthetic on its journey to Vietnam. The donator is eventually sent a profile of the recipient in Vietnam, an aspect of the process that appeals to many, Duong said. Many individuals have a strong emotional connection to their prosthetic and like to know where it is going, Wang said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Duong focuses on the side of the business that occurs in Vietnam, coordinating relationships with local doctors and hospitals as well as finding, interviewing and selecting amputees to receive the prosthetics. Duong’s time in the city as well as her understanding of life in Vietnam has allowed her to better navigate the process, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Penta has already fitted dozens of people with prosthetics and hopes to complete an additional 200 fittings this summer. The organization hopes to scale up that number in the future, using this summer’s fittings as a trial run for a larger operation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to providing prosthetics for amputees, Penta aims to alleviate the stigma against the amputee community within Vietnam. This past summer, the organization ran a program for high schoolers in the country, educating students on the difficulties that amputees face with the hope that these students would advocate on behalf of the community in the future. Penta will run the program again this summer, Duong said, as the last trip was very successful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Wang said his time at Penta has given him many “personal and emotional” experiences, both in the United States and Vietnam. He said that it was powerful to interact with people who had such interest in the fate of the prosthetics and to see the transformative effects of their work in Vietnam. Yuri Lee, a Rhode Island School of Design student and photographer for Penta, said that her time with Penta has enabled her to use her skills as a photographer to help make an impact, something that she hopes to achieve once she graduates in June as well.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Duong is currently a Social Innovation Fellow through the Swearer Center for Public Service. The fellowship has helped provide support for growing Penta and offered helpful feedback and ideas for the organization, Duong said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Penta has operated largely on various grants received from Brown, Yale, the Clinton Foundation and a variety of other organizations, Duong hopes that the organization will be able to sustain itself in the future through the $200 charge, which will cover medical and overhead costs for the organization.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brain models with blood vessels may accelerate research</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Creating models of the intricate human brain is a daunting task, but tiny round structures assembled from brain cells demonstrate many qualities of the tissue within our skulls. Models developed in the Hoffman-Kim Lab even contain networks of miniscule vessels that resemble capillaries like those that carry blood through our brains. By constructing models that mimic the brain, scientists can better understand neurological problems and develop treatments for them more effectively.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These mini model brains were born in the Hoffman-Kim Lab: Researchers placed cells from the brains of young rats in plates where they sank and then started sticking together, eventually forming a round mass of connected cells. “It typically takes about 24 hours for the cells to form a compact spheroid, and then they’ll grow from there,” said Molly Boutin, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite their tiny scale, these models possess many characteristics of the human brain itself. New chemical treatments rendered the models more transparent so imaging could reveal the capillary-like networks within them, Boutin said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The presence of these networks means that the models may help researchers study neurological issues. Many neurodegenerative diseases affect the blood vessels in the brain, said Liana Kramer ’17, co-author of the paper. “It’s really important to understand what happens in all these different disease states in order to make therapeutics and treatments.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Recovery from a stroke or head trauma is linked to the growth of blood vessels in the brain, Boutin said. Observing blood vessel development in these models after injury might also yield insight for researchers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Studying healthy models could be productive as well. “The brain is one of the body systems that isn’t well understood yet,” Kramer said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Compared to many commonly used models, these structures have more in common with actual human brains. Instead of using just neurons, they include multiple cell types. Boutin said that the way these cells interact still eludes scientists, but studying them together will better illustrate what happens in the brain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Scientists could feasibly use these models to test new therapies for neurological diseases. About 90 percent of drugs fail clinical trials, according to a study published in the journal Nature. “There’s obviously something wrong with that,” Boutin said. The cell-based models used to test drugs are one piece of that process. Models that do not reflect the operations of the body might show drugs failing when they could help real patients.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">No drug for Alzheimer’s disease has passed clinical trials, for example. There are “many arguments for why they failed, but one is that human brains are different from animal brains,” said Hansang Cho, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and engineering science at The University of North Carolina. If scientists could build accurate models of human brains, they could provide more accurate drug testing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Two-dimensional brain models — cells plated on glass or plastic chips — are still commonly used in research and testing. But “that’s not what my body is like, so it makes sense that the cells don’t want to behave the way that they do in my body,” Boutin said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“A lot of the neuro-research is pretty slow in its development, and a lot of that is because of the platforms that are used,” Kramer said. These brain models, which can be produced in great quantities, have the potential to accelerate research.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Fortunately, there is a resurgence of interest in 3D models,” said Damir Janigro, scientific director of Flocel Inc., a company whose mission is to develop a model for drug testing that better reproduces the behavior of the blood-brain barrier.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The models produced by University researchers still cannot imitate the brain perfectly. Unlike a normal brain, no fluid flows through the mini models, which means they cannot demonstrate the distribution of materials. And they lack many components of the membrane separating blood from the brain, Janigro said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Through collaboration with other researchers, the lab hopes to create a device that would allow fluid to flow through the networks and tissues. The same process they used here could be applied to human cells, Kramer said, which would create models more similar to human brains. “There’s a lot of different directions we can take this,” she added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A building collapses and victims are stuck beneath rubble. A rescue team moves debris as quickly as possible but struggles to find people in the chaos. The team launches a robot that can fly through the narrow spaces and nimbly maneuver through the rubble. With the robot’s help, it locates people faster.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A scenario like this might now be possible. Funded by the National Science Foundation and the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research, a group of researchers at Brown, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the California Institute of Technology has created a prototype of a robot based on a bat that can fly in tight spaces and change direction quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bats,­ known for their unique flying abilities, have significant control over their wings and the ability to perform acrobatic maneuvers. They are also the only mammals that can sustain prolonged flight — another quality that makes them an ideal model, said Professor of Engineering Kenneth Breuer ’82 P’14 P’16.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team at Brown studied how real bats move and created a model for the robot’s flight patterns, said Hamid Vejdani GS. Using a wind tunnel and a camera-rigged room, they were able to analyze how bats fly under perfect conditions and in varying wind speeds.</span></p>
<p class="p4">David Boerma GS helped train bats to land in specific spots within the team’s laboratory, though it was no easy task. “It’s just as perplexing as it sounds,” Boerma said. Using food rewards and a number of different bats, the team was able to encourage movements relevant to the research.</p>
<p class="p4">From the data and analysis put together by the team at Brown, roboticists at Illinois and the CalTech built a robot that flies like a bat. The robot can be used for search and rescue missions, inspections and other expeditions that take place in confined spaces, Breuer said. “It’s really encouraging to see how pure biological interests can translate into solutions to problems that people actually care about,” Boerma said.</p>
<p class="p4">Building robots based on biological models is a relatively new technique — some of the first prototypes of such robots used basic models of movements starting as early as the 1970s, said Kaushik Jayaram, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard. Known as bio-inspired robotics, this area of study has become increasingly popular, he added.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bio-inspired robotics encourages collaboration between different fields to draw upon multiple sources of knowledge and frames of thought. “Engineers and biologists working together to answer common questions which both fields are interested in can definitely move us further ahead than if these groups work individually,” Jayaram said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the future, the team hopes to explore how bats land and react to blasts of wind, Breuer said. Additionally, they aim to test the robot in Brown’s wind tunnel and make improvements to its design.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Datathon brings 180 students together for weekend competition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">College and high school students, general data enthusiasts and hackers alike came together this weekend to learn and work overnight in the University’s 2017 Datathon. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A datathon is “a hackathon with datasets,” said Tanay Padhi ’17, one of the head organizers of the event. “We want to get more and more students some sort of platform where they can start working on problems involving data.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brown’s Smith-Buonanno Hall was abuzz with activity this weekend as teams labored tirelessly to win the competition, finding new ways to apply data to the real world as they worked. The first day began with a presentation by keynote speaker Marzyeh Ghassemi, a Ph.D. candidate conducting research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. She delved into the use of clinical data and machine learning in health care. After the talk,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>students formed teams and began their projects.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Padhi emphasized the autonomy that the teams had in their projects, noting their freedom to use any languages or frameworks they chose. The organizers offered participants data from different sources, including areas like travel, terrorism and health care. Teams could also use external data sources as long as they used at least one provided by the datathon. “What they come up with can be in many different forms,” Padhi said. “They could do literally whatever they want.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Participants began learning and working with data through workshops offered over the course of the weekend. “We felt like we needed a diverse overview of everything,” said Charlene Wang ’20, the head organizer of the workshops. Some of the workshops aimed to increase the inclusivity of the event, such as one for those who had no background in computer science, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Judges, including University faculty from math, computer science and biostatistics programs and a Google employee, evaluated each team based on a rubric.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“One thing that people did quite well was telling a story with their data,” said Jeffrey Brock, director of the Data Science Initiative and chair of the mathematics department, who acted as one of the judges for the competition. He looked for creativity in the presentations and teams that brought a deeper statistical or methodological knowledge to the table, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There aren’t many events like this,” Padhi said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The three winning teams each received a prize: DJI Phantom 3 4K drones for the first-place winners, Bose wireless noise-cancelling headphones for the second place winners and Google Homes for the third-place winners.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The organizers improved upon the smaller datathon they hosted last year, offering more datasets and opening up the event to students outside of Brown. The team received a total of 540 applications, and 180 of the selected applicants attended, Padhi said. Seventy of these applicants came from other schools, including Yale, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton, Bucknell University, Harvard and local high schools. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The datathon organizers decided to host a weekend-long event instead of coordinating semester-long endeavors so they could provide participants with the resources they needed to work on their projects, such as space, food and data.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Padhi hoped that students would leave the datathon with a sense of confidence that they can approach any dataset and understand how to analyze it and use it to answer questions. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University researchers analyze revival of for-profit medical schools</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">After nearly a century of dormancy, for-profit medical schools are making a return in the United States. A recent paper by University researchers analyzed the history, reappearance and possible effects that these schools could have on medical education.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though at one time for-profit medical schools existed in the United States, this changed with the publishing of Abraham Flexner’s 1910 report on the state of these schools, according to the paper. There were numerous critiques of these schools in Flexner’s report, particularly of the standards, requirements, teaching and students’ clinical and research exposure. The report led to a renovation of medical teaching and the subsequent disappearance of for-profit institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The medical education system accepted nearly all students who could afford to pay tuition prior to 1910, Gruppuso said. “There was no standardized set of requirements for medical schools, and it was creating a real crisis in terms of quality for medical care.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In 1996, the court case United States v. American Bar Association made it possible for for-profit law schools to be established, according to the paper. Though the Liaison Committee on Medical Education had previously been opposed to for-profit medical schools, they slowly began to change their opinions after the court case and eventually allowed for for-profit medical schools to be established in 2013.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to the paper, a number of investor-owned schools, such as the Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine, have been accredited, and more have received preliminary and provisional accreditation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Philip Gruppuso, professor of pediatrics and an author of the paper, said the main point of the article was to bring both the existence and establishment of these for-profit schools to public attention.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(This article) sheds light on the fact that not all medical schools in the United States are nonprofit institutions, so I’m not sure that people both in and out of the medical world realize that these institutions are also out to make money for their shareholder and whoever else owns them,” said Paul George, associate professor of medicine, who was unaffiliated with the study.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Flexner report became the basis for most of what is now seen as the contemporary set of standards for admission and accreditation in medical education and the composition of medical school as two years of scientific education and two years of clinical experience, Gruppuso said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The report led to two major developments in the area of for-profit medical schools, said Eli Adashi, professor of medical science and lead author of the paper. Students increasingly stopped enrolling because they were losing confidence in these institutions. Secondly, more nonprofit medical schools were established at the time and were often affiliated with a research university, in contrast to for-profit medical schools. “These academic-medical centers educated virtually all American physicians since the Flexner report,” Adashi added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the paper, the authors delineated a number of challenges that for-profit institutions face, such as poor reputations. Many of these stem from today’s common Flexnerian viewpoints, as well as frequent comparison to other for-profit educational institutions that are often at the center of many legal disputes, according to the paper.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While high-profile schools like Harvard and Yale have faculty members and administration who are at the forefront of medicine, “aspects like that are just not currently possible with the for-profit model,” Krishna said. “It’ll be interesting to see, as the for-profit schools go, if they will be able to develop that same academic profile and bring the same resources to their students.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Another challenge is the widespread notion that for-profit medical schools have significantly lower standards than nonprofit medical schools, according to the paper. To assuage these concerns, these institutions will have to prioritize the ethical and educational aspects above profit, the authors wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the lenient standards of for-profit schools in the pre-Flexnerian era were a major concern, they are not for today’s for-profit medical schools, according to the paper. The schools now have more stringent academic requirements, such as mandating clinical rotations and providing scholastic opportunities in the curriculum. The report serves to reassure people that these for-profit schools have to meet the same requirements as nonprofit institutions, George said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“At the end of the day, for many of these students to become physicians, they all have to pass the same board exams and compete on the national level in order to get residency spots,” Krishna said. She added there will always be a demand for medical schools and she would not be surprised to see more for-profit medical schools being established in the future. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For-profit schools could be a significant boon to the shortage of doctors and the easing of medical student debt, according to the paper. Due to their lower cost structure, for-profit medical schools could also provide lower tuition, more scholarships and innovation in medical instruction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The major point of the paper is that (for-profit medical schools) are being established. We hope that they will be held to a high standard and that there will conceivably be benefits from their establishment,” Gruppuso said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We may not know as much as we think we do, University research suggests. Our own knowledge may be riddled with holes, but the information contained in many people’s minds forms a vast web of communal understanding, according to Steven Sloman, professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences. The shared knowledge effect described by Sloman reveals our ignorance as individuals and points to the intellectual strength of groups.</p>
<p class="p2">“The Knowledge Illusion: Why We Never Think Alone” — a book co-written by Sloman and released this week — delves into the workings of shared knowledge and its applications in areas like technology, education and definitions of intelligence.</p>
<p class="p2">Sloman’s recent research involved experiments that presented people with information about a concept, including a statement about how well experts understood it. When scientists asked participants how well they understood the concept, they gave higher ratings to their own comprehension when they were told that experts have explained it. “People were confusing what other people know with what they know,” Sloman said. “They think knowledge in other people’s heads is in their heads.”</p>
<p class="p2">This confusion happens much more commonly than we expect. People will report that they understand the functioning of a simple device, like a ballpoint pen, but when asked to explain how it works, they often fall silent, Sloman said.</p>
<p class="p2">The same holds true in the realm of politics: People tend to have strong opinions about Obamacare, but they typically cannot explain the legislation when asked. “I strongly suspect that even Obama doesn’t really understand Obamacare,” Sloman said.</p>
<p class="p2">President Trump provides an “extreme example” of the shared knowledge effect, Sloman said. His “knowledge is almost completely illusory. He talks as if he knows everything. … When he’s pressed, he seems to have little or nothing to say.”</p>
<p class="p2">The shared knowledge effect is present in all of us to some degree. Humans are collaborative by nature — even kids collaborate more than other primates. “This is a fundamental property of the human mind,” Sloman said. “The mind is a shared entity, and that’s true of everybody.”</p>
<p class="p2">Shared knowledge is both a strength and a weakness of the way we think. “It’s a weakness if you overestimate your own knowledge, which is very easy to do,” said Nathaniel Rabb ’15, co-author on one of Sloman’s papers and lab manager at Boston College’s Arts and Mind Lab. Relying on others for information can create an “echo chamber” in which no one has a thorough understanding, Rabb said.</p>
<p class="p2">This type of “vicarious” knowledge sets up an “ignorance arrangement” in modern societies, wrote Michael Smithson, professor at Australian National University’s Research School of Psychology, in an email to The Herald. For most of our knowledge, “we don’t need to know what the expert knows, but only which expert to turn to for our purposes.” But this arrangement raises concerns about the power of authorities and our ability to identify valid expertise, Smithson wrote.</p>
<p class="p2">We are dependent on our own judgments about the reliability of information. “Think about your reasons for believing someone else who says they understand,” Rabb said. “Maybe they don’t. Take it with a grain of salt.”</p>
<p class="p2">The novel part of Sloman’s recent research is that even just knowing that an expert understands a topic inflates people’s sense of their own understanding, wrote Frank Keil, professor of psychology and linguistics at Yale, in an email to The Herald. The expert’s explanation itself is not necessary.</p>
<p class="p2">Keil has investigated similar concepts in his own laboratory and found similar effects. “People confuse information stored in their own minds with information they can search for on the internet,” he said. Even the act of using a search engine makes us feel like we understand more than we do, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Sloman’s research “adds another charge to the rap sheet of human cognition,” wrote Ryan McKay, reader in the departmen<span class="s1">t of psychology at Royal Holloway, University of London, in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the shared knowledge effect can also be hugely beneficial. “It is a strength if you respect it, as long as you assess the source of information,” Rabb said, offering the example of a physics paper written by many authors. “Not a single one of them knows what the paper is saying, and they did this based on their trust in each other’s knowledge,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sloman is currently pursuing research on how we can “improve public discourse by getting people to think outside themselves,” he said. Politicians often focus on treasured values, but directing debate toward the effects of policy may be more productive, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This area of research has an “ever increasing importance in our interconnected world,” Keil said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our power comes from other people, Sloman said, and we need to recognize that. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The practical goal of the research is to reduce hubris, to make people more humble about their level of knowledge,” Sloman said. He hopes the research will encourage people to “be more open and accepting of o</span>thers’ ideas and feel a greater need to justify their own.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The 2017 Brown Brain Fair saw people of many different ages and interests come together with a single purpose — to learn about the brain. More specifically, they came to Sayles Hall March 19 to hear about different aspects of the brain’s anatomy, applications and recent research advancements.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Brain Fair — organized by Brown Brain Bee, an undergraduate student group — was the “keystone event” of Brain Week Rhode Island, said Oliver Tang ’19, Brown Brain Bee’s undergraduate volunteers coordinator. It was free and open to anyone who was interested in attending.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The booths were hosted by a variety of laboratories, student groups and advocacy organizations. Groups that attended included VENlab, which offered people the chance to experience virtual reality; the Rhode Island Consortium for Autism Research and Treatment; students from Cranston High School East, who brought an electroencephalogram, allowing people to see their brain waves; BrainGate, which demonstrated the applications of a brain-computer interface and the NeuroMotion lab, which displayed the brain’s function in muscle activity and action coordination. Other topics covered included cognition and optical illusions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tang said one of the goals of the event was to bring in new voices to the field of neuroscience. Teaching neuroscience is one of the easiest ways to get kids interested in science education, due to the vast amount of untapped potential in brain research, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Brown Brain Bee looked to improve upon the first Brown Brain Fair, which took place last year. A number of student groups from different grade levels attended, ranging from those who have just started elementary school to those who are close to graduating from college, said Carin Papendorp ’17, a co-head coordinator.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Nearly 800 people attended this year, about 200 more than last year,” said Mackenzie Woodburn ’17, a co-head coordinator. “This brought a wide variety of ages, but we really increased the number of families and children who attended this year.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While gaining exposure for the Brain Bee last year was difficult, news of this year’s fair was largely spread by word-of-mouth from those who attended last year, Papendorp said. The Brain Fair won “Best Student Event” at the Student Activities Center in 2016, and the organization was hoping to build on that momentum, Tang said. He added that a number of other institutions, such as the University of Rhode Island, are beginning to hold their own brain fairs this year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tang said the Brain Week organizers are always trying to brainstorm new ideas for events at the Brain Fair. “Our pinnacle lecture for this week came from Elyn Saks, a MacArthur Fellow,” he said. “The fact that we were able to get a MacArthur fellow at this year’s event to talk about her experience with schizophrenia was really momentous to us and the evolution of the Brain Fair.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Papendorp said she hopes younger people leave the event with a newfound interest in neuroscience and excited about problems that still need to be solved in the field. She added she believes everyone can learn to appreciate how complex the brain is and how to protect it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tang hopes people will leave with an understanding that neuroscience is a very human discipline with human applications. “One thing that I am always personally excited about for the Brain Fair is spurring undergraduate involvement in neuroscience research.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition to the Brain Fair, the Brown Brain Bee hosts a number of events relating to the brain, such as the Brown Brain Bee Competition, a quiz bowl-style competition for high school students designed to test their knowledge of neuroscience. The Bee saw its fifth competition this February. The organization also holds weekly neuroscience classes in order to prepare these students for the competition, as well as a number of activities to further promote interest in neuroscience.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article listed the keynote speaker as Ella Sacks, but her name is Elyn Saks. The Herald regrets this error. </strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">According to the University mission statement, Brown strives to “serve the community, the nation and the world by discovering, communicating and preserving knowledge.” But as Andrew Creamer, the University Library’s scientific data management specialist, pointed out, the University has yet to support a policy encouraging open access to the public to the research conducted by faculty members, limiting the communication of knowledge created at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In recent years, researchers, citizens and aspiring scientists across the nation have increasingly called for open access to scientific papers, journals and data. A number of prominent cases, such as programmer and open access activist Aaron Swartz’ 2013 suicide and the creation of Sci-Hub , an online repository of pirated scientific papers, have put the campaign for public information in the national spotlight. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Open access has a number of advantages: It makes scientific research accessible to those that cannot afford it, especially people in low-resource countries, has been shown to increase citations for papers and lowers the barrier to entry for startups. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, questions have arisen over the funding model and reputation of open access journals. These journals typically force the author — rather than the consumer or library — to pay for publication, putting an occasionally heavy burden on the author. Additionally, many new journals simply seek to extract money from researchers and are willing to publish anything that an author pays for. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though open access has become more popular in recent years, researchers have been slow to adapt. Young researchers seeking to establish themselves in a field often aspire to publish in journals with the best reputations, which are often paywalled, said Hope Lappen, a University biomedical and life sciences librarian. If the system of journal publishing were to shift toward open access, tenure and promotion systems would have to change as well, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Open access at Brown </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The debate over open access has come to campus. In 2011, the faculty senate debated instituting an open access policy, which would encourage publication in open access journals.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The senate ultimately voted against it, citing fears of agitating relationships with publishers and a suspicion of the peer-review systems of these journals. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While Brown has not instituted an open access policy, a number of other universities have. Brown and Yale are the only Ivy League universities with no such policies in place. Harvard, Penn, Dartmouth, Cornell and Princeton all officially support open access and have enacted university-wide policies encouraging or even enforcing it. Columbia has instituted policies in a limited number of its schools. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University also has dealt with the rising costs of journals. From 1994 to 2014, the University more than tripled its expenditures on journals, from $2.2 million to $6.7 million, according to a library budget analysis. The analysis partially blamed the bundling of journals, rather than their individual sale, for increased costs. This cost has outpaced inflation significantly; from 1986 to 2013, the consumer price index — a standard measure of inflation — rose 113 percent while the cost of serials increased 495 percent. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though open access theoretically reduces the cost for libraries, the University pays twice for institutional acces for some open access journals, with charges being placed on the author for publication as well as the library for subscription; the journals may be free to individuals, but only after institutions pay for access, Creamer said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For Marjo Beltoja ’18, a coordinator of the Physics Departmental Undergraduate Group, these expenses have been worth it. They helped him access content for physics DUG meetings as well as for his personal use, while friends at community colleges and in high school have not had such opportunities. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Even though no open access policy is in place, the University provides a number of resources to researchers who wish to make their work widely available. Brown operates a publicly available database, Researchers@Brown, where faculty members can post their work and other relevant information about themselves. The site gives open access to University research that may be behind a paywall elsewhere, but it has only been used by a limited number of faculty, Creamer said. For example, a search on the website reveals that President Christina Paxson P’19 does not have a profile on the site but individually uploaded her work. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">University librarians such as Lappen help authors negotiate and understand their grant and publishing agreements to enable them to publish their work in either open access journals or on their personal websites. While a variety of legal issues can arise when publishing, many authors do not face pushback from publishers, Lappen said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Creamer helps researchers make the data underlying their research freely available as well. He promotes the use of the Brown Data Repository, a place where University researchers can upload their data sets and make them available to the public. The repository has gained traction among University researchers and enables other researchers to take a deeper look at the data supporting research papers, Creamer said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Impact of national policies</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite failure to implement a University-wide policy, many fields have embraced open access to varying degrees. In the biology department, researchers have been forced to make much of their work open access. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In 2008, the National Institutes of Health created an open access policy, stipulating that the manuscripts of scientific papers with research funded by the agency must be made publicly available 12 months after publication. These papers are published on PubMed Central, a database that is available to the general public. As a main source of funding in the field, this move by the NIH has greatly impacted researchers, said Edward Hawrot, professor of medical science and associate dean of biology. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though biologists, including Hawrot, continue to publish their research in paywalled academic journals for their prestige, the work becomes available to everyone and grants access to those previously unable to pay for the work, Hawrot added. In particular, Hawrot said researchers at institutions unable to pay for journal subscriptions, particularly those in developing countries, have benefitted significantly. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Erika Denour ’18, a leader of the biology DUG, had difficulty accessing several articles that were published in the last 12 months while writing a research proposal on Medicaid participation in dentistry. “Not being able to access those research articles didn’t impact me being able to write my proposal, but … what if I were a government official at the Rhode Island Department of Health and I couldn’t access these articles? Those people … wouldn’t have access. That’s kind of scary.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the engineering department, researchers have embraced open access much more slowly than those in biology. Each engineering discipline has its own publishing “culture,” but in general, there has been a shift toward open access, said Dean of Engineering Lawrence Larson. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> In 2015, the National Science Foundation — the main source of funding for the engineering department’s research — implemented a policy mandating that all research that receives funding must be publicly posted and available for download a year after publication, similar to the NIH policy. But this policy is only applicable to research grants awarded after Jan. 25, 2016. Due to the slow nature of the grant approval process and scientific research itself, this stipulation has yet to have a strong impact on researchers, Larson said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But this model is a good compromise, Beltoja said, adding that it benefits authors during the 12-month period as well as those normally unable to access content. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Alternate models of open access</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the fields of physics and mathematics, researchers are particularly strong proponents of making their work available; many in these fields utilize a resource named arXiv, a free online repository for pre-print publications based out of Cornell. While authors are not charged to upload to this database and readers are not charged for access, there is no system of peer review in place, leaving no way to verify a paper’s accuracy. However, papers with errors are typically spotted and removed by the author, said Leon Cooper, professor of science and director of the Institute for Brain and Neural Systems.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ArXiv has become ingrained in the research culture in mathematics, though researchers still publish in paywalled journals, said Brendan Hassett, professor of mathematics and director of the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics. At this point, authors publish in paywalled journals for the status associated with doing so, he added. If a journal were to prevent authors from posting their work on arXiv, it would face significant backlash. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the field of physics, the use of arXiv is pervasive as well, as it was originally created for physicists, Hassett said. Similar to the field of mathematics, researchers publish their work both in arXiv and in paywalled journals, mainly for their status. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If it were up to me, I would put everything in the arXiv, but I have a lot of younger colleagues and it means a lot to them to get published,” Cooper said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In electrical engineering, a model known as “gold open access” is becoming increasingly common, Larson said. In this funding model, the author bears the cost of publication, but the research is available to everyone. Completely free open access journals have yet to really take off in the field, partially because no one has figured out the business model, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Engineering Alexander Zaslavsky described a slow embrace of open access as well. Zaslavsky is an editor for Solid State Electronics, a paywalled journal run by Elsevier, a major publishing company. He described the cost of open access publication for authors as “especially grim” in countries such as India or China, where institutions or grants may not cover the cost of open access publication. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Looking ahead </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Across the board, researchers at Brown believe in promoting the availability of research in some form. But there is no perfect model for publication yet, Larson said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Larson envisions a system in which research papers could be uploaded to a database and then voted on for approval. The voting would act as a form of peer review, weeding out papers with issues and errors. While theoretical, this system could potentially help reduce some of the costs associated with journals, Larson added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lappen instead focused on solutions that the University could act upon. In order to make publishing easier for researchers — who occasionally feel burdened by the need to comply with both federal and University policies — Lappen would like to see a central repository developed in which researchers could upload their peer-reviewed manuscripts to be accessed by both the funding agency and the University, eliminating some of the bureaucracy surrounding publication.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lappen would also like to see a centralization of University reports on research outputs; currently, there is no single, publicly available report that describes how much research is being done at Brown — a necessary precursor to any open access policy. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While open access has gained support both locally and nationally, Zaslavsky described the one true limitation to complete open access: “There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Somebody, somewhere must pay.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Updated April 3 at 12:37 p.m.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">University students and computer scientists have been working to reduce errors in human-robot interactions for the past several months at the University’s Humans To Robots Laboratory. A research team of undergraduate and graduate students proposed a new model that programs a robot to more effectively retrieve an object through question-asking and information processing implied from hand gestures, according to the research team’s published article “Reducing Errors in Object-Fetching Interactions through Social Feedback.” The study’s findings are important because they might streamline many tasks related to health care, home life and maintenance activities, said David Whitney GS, co-author of the study.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fetching items is a problem social robots currently face, according to the research team’s article. The act of fetching requires a robot to interpret human language and gestures to infer what item to deliver. “If the robot could ask questions, it would help the robot be faster and more accurate in its task,” according to the article. Currently, social robots are not programmed to ask questions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To test their program, which is based on a mathematical model of probability assigned to a group of objects, a user would stand in front of the robot with six items spread across a table directly in front of the robot. The six items are two identical plastic bowls, two identical Expo markers and two identical metal spoons. In the first set-up, the items were spread out along a large arc in front of the robot with the identical pairs placed far apart from one another, creating an unambiguous situation. In the second set-up, the items were in a line at the center of the table with identical pairs placed close to each other, making pointing a less effective method for getting the robot to distinguish items.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The researchers only wanted the robot to ask questions when it was in an ambiguous situation, such as in the second table set-up, said Eric Rosen ’18, co-author of the study. In a clear situation akin to the first table set-up, the robot should not ask a question, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Overall, the researchers found that the model systems were accurate: detecting the correct item with 88.4 percent accuracy in the ambiguous table set-up and 97.9 percent in the unambiguous table set-up. The team also found that the results of the experiments confirmed its hypotheses that asking questions would improve the robots’ ability to accurately retrive items in the ambiguous set-up. In the unambiguous set up, the model was much faster without the robot asking a question, the study found.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> It is important that robots ask questions when retrieving objects because “the sensing of robots is very poor,” Whitney said. They were surprised that the simple questions the robot asked “dramatically increased (the) accuracy, and people enjoy it more because it feels like a real conversation,” Whitney said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This current technology with robots “has profound implications,” said Joyce Chai, professor in the department of computer science and engineering at Michigan State University, who was cited in the research team’s published article. “We see robots in hotel service, elderly care, … but you cannot expect humans to work with robots by using (complex) interfaces to control the robot,” she added. Since language is the most natural means by which humans interact with one another, it is important for language to exist between robots and humans, Chai said. “I think what the group has done will have important applications in the future for joint tasks,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the team’s research was a significant development in this area of study, robots’ communication with humans can still be further enhanced, Rosen and Whitney said. “In this particular project, we only implemented two modalities of communication: speaking and pointing gestures,” Rosen said. “But the way robots understand speaking is very basic,” he added. They currently do not understand the concepts of “left” and “right,” he said. The Humans To Robots Laboratory hopes to expand on its research so that the robot system can understand this concept of directionality and more complex syntax, Whitney said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> The team’s research will be presented this year at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation to be held from May 29 to June 3 in Singapore.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Edward Melillo, associate professor of history and environmental studies at Amherst College, has been drawn to insects since childhood.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He first felt a connection to the six-legged creatures in an entomology class at age 11 when he watched a butterfly drink from a juicy slice of watermelon on a sweltering day. He felt the same “interspecies kinship” as a doctoral student when he traveled thousands of miles to reach the West Coast and gazed at masses of Monarch butterflies, thickly clustered on trees in Natural Bridges Park after their own long migration.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Melillo is now working on a book titled “The Butterfly Effect: Insects and the Making of the Modern World,” which he discussed Thursday in the top floor of Pembroke Hall. Expansive literature exists describing insects’ damaging effects on humanity, Melillo said, but he wanted to explore some of the “other kinds of relationships we’ve had with our insect cousins.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The pervasive influence of insects reverberates across societies, their bodies and products playing an integral role in areas ranging from genetics research to the execution of delicate surgical techniques. Beyond our dependence on pollinators and love of honey, insects are deeply enmeshed in human systems.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Melillo’s work “challenges us to rethink modernity,” said Claire Brault, postdoctoral fellow in political science.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Modern times have seen a resurgence of many insect products. As one example, shellac is produced from lac insect secretions harvested from tree branches and used in the creation of various products, including vinyl records. “If you listen to a shellac record, you can really hear the substance in the sound. It does sound like bacon crisping,” Melillo said. “The shellac is part of the genesis of the sonic landscape.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Humans have taken advantage of insects and their products for thousands of years. The use of cochineal insects holds a long history in the Americas — the Aztecs inherited the tradition from their predecessors. The female insects are crushed and used in a deep red dye, which retains its vibrant color over decades and even centuries. The product pleased Europeans during the colonial period, as they took red to symbolize virility. “Imagine ship after ship crossing the Atlantic loaded with cochineal bricks, each of which took 70,000 crushed female insect bodies to make,” Melillo said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Silk, produced by silkworms, has also wielded a strong influence in historical and contemporary societies, Melillo said. When the Parthians of northeast Persia revealed large banners of silk during battle with the Romans, their opponents were so enthralled by the spectacle that they were distracted from fighting. The modern fabrication of silk bears a close resemblance to the manufacturing process used in ancient times, but this old-fashioned procedure has been combined with twenty-first century marketing to secure silk’s central place in the fashion industry.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Grace Gagnon ’18 was impressed by the pervasive influence of silk production on many activities, “whether it’s empire building or even just daily life,” she said. “I probably shouldn’t be surprised by the extent to which insect products have made their way into our culture.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Melillo hopes to reveal a deep and intertwined bond between insects and humans that takes into account more than just their monetary value in society. “If we just place an economic value on our relationship with insects, what do we lose?”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Caroline Klivans, senior lecturer in applied mathematics and computer science, achieved every student’s dream and proved her former advisor wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Partitionability Conjecture was postulated by Richard Stanley, Klivans’ doctorate advisor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Fewer than 50 years later, his advisee challenged the claim.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Alongside colleagues from the University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Kansas, Klivans released a paper disproving the 35 year-old Partitionability Conjecture earlier this year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(Stanley) is an outstanding mathematician who has made many conjectures that lead the field,” Klivans said. “He has many that are correct.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Partitionability Conjecture demonstrates the relationship between classes of spaces<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and how they interact at different levels, Klivans said. This conjecture shows the relationships as beautiful and organized, which is a compelling belief for those invested in the subfield of algebraic combinatorics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“In some sense, we believed these were true because it gave order, it gave pattern, it gave structure to this area,” Klivans said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Klivans undermined this structure with a team consisting of University of Texas at El Paso Professor Art Duval and University of Kansas Professor Jeremy Martin, working with the assistance of University of Kansas graduate student Bennet Goeckner.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Klivans, Duval and Martin have been partners in math for over nine years. After meeting at a conference in San Diego, the professors have created a tradition of weekly Skype calls. Their long-standing collaboration has produced a series of joint papers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve had these weekly meetings for longer than one would expect,” Klivans said. “Even our colleagues have been surprised by our consistency.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Through disproving the organized structure of the Partitionability Conjecture, Klivans and her team created all kinds of questions that lie at the intersection of various fields of mathematics and computer science.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“I am reminded of the end of Pride and Prejudice,” said Duval. “At the end, Mr. Bennett says something like, ‘Hey, which other daughters can I marry off now?’ With the Paritionability Conjecture, it was like, ‘Which other conjectures can we ruin?’”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Klivans and her colleagues are now tackling technicality questions that emerged from their recent disproof, Klivans and Duval both confirmed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">But individually, Klivans is moving on. She is writing a book on sandpile models set to come out at the end of the year. Titled “The Mathematics of Chip Firing,” Klivans’ newest project will explain how a system with local rules, such as physical sand falling onto a surface, leads to more widespread effects. Klivans is drawing on her intersectional interest within mathematics and computer science to produce what she calls a “resource cannon for the area of study.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While she works on her research through Brown and the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, Klivans’ acclaim as a lecturer caught the attention of the computer science department. She was recently promoted to senior lecturer, which provides a salary boost and public recognition of good work, said Tom Doeppner, vice chair of the computer science department. </span></p>
<p class="p2">"She has been doing an outstanding job as an instructor," said Doeppner. "She teaches two very popular classes: An applied math class in the fall, and a computer science class in the spring. Both courses are attracting huge numbers of student."</p>
<p class="p2">As for Klivans's relationship with Stanley, the two remain great friends. Klivans was even an organizer for Stanley's 70th birthday party, which was a conference to honor his groundbreaking work.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ethnobotany society connects students to plants</title>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">“Where do you guys imagine your food comes from?” asked Aja Grande ’18 as she drove a van filled with members of Brown’s Ethnobotany Society toward a greenhouse on a small farm in Cranston. Pak Express Farm is barren in the early stages of spring, but within its white greenhouse grows a wide variety of vegetables that are sold to Brown students and professors as market shares.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chang Xiong emigrated from Laos in 1996 and started Pak Express Farm five years later. It was much easier to farm in her home country, she said, because transplanting was not necessary — the soil here does not hold the same qualities. Xiong grew sugar cane and papayas in Laos, but in her Rhode Island greenhouse, she pointed out green onions, sweet peppers and peas. The broccoli grew out of seeds sent to the United States by Xiong’s sister, who still lives in Laos.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Students examined rows of seedlings and touched their leaves, listening as Xiong explained how one plant could be used to make a medicinal soup for new mothers and described a vegetable whose name she could not translate. There’s something inexplicable about being outside, surrounded by plants, Grande said. “You feel enlightened, you feel refreshed.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Grande formed Brown’s Ethnobotany Society this semester to hear different viewpoints on human-plant interactions and to connect students to flora through off-campus excursions like this one. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ethnobotany, which emerged alongside anthropology, focuses on the multifaceted relationship between people and plants. Though there is no standalone concentration at Brown, students have found ways to focus their studies on ethnobotany through other areas of study, such as fashion, food or medicine. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In studying ethnobotany, Grande emphasized the importance of preserving indigenous knowledge on plants. “There are cultures that are dying, and their knowledge of certain plants is indispensable,” she said, adding that this kind of information may not be widely known or utilized by doctors.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shannon Kingsley ’20, a concentrator in history and biology, was also drawn to the use of botany by indigenous groups, especially in comparison to the treatments used in the health care system. “There are benefits of using natural products to heal ailments versus using a drug from a store to suit your medical needs,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In medicine, “the thought that plants could really have healing power is novel,” said Spenser Anderson ’18, who plans to concentrate in public health and development studies. “It forms a different kind of science.” Biotechnology has also made great advances by mimicking nature, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chiara Arellano ’20, an environmental studies concentrator, has tended to focus her studies on humans more than plants. But she was intrigued by the science of plant identification.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Ethnobotany Society’s next event will bring students into the forest May 15 to hunt, identify and eat mushrooms. Grande hopes other members will bring ideas for the society to her, expanding the club’s focus. “That’s how disciplines get started,” she said. “A random group of people.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Xiong will transplant her seedlings into the earth beginning this month, continuing to work eight hours a day with her plants.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I like to farm,” Xiong said. “You become strong.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>U. announces $5 million emergency research fund</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Provost Richard Locke announced the creation of a $5 million emergency research fund March 28 that will be used to support research projects if government funding is suddenly cut. In such cases, researchers will be able to apply for access to money from the fund, which will ease the process of closing down those investigations, said Vice President for Research David Savitz, whose office will oversee the fund. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University created the fund in response to “concern about how precarious research funding is right now, particularly in politically sensitive areas,” Savitz said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There have been proposals to dramatically increase funding for defense and homeland security that would come at the expense of funding for agencies that support university-based research,” Locke wrote in an email to The Herald. Sharp cuts into these agencies’ budgets could stop ongoing University research projects, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although the fund is meant to cover all types of research, investigations in some areas are more prone to be defunded than others, Savitz said. Research in climate change, clean energy, contraception or pregnancy termination and social or behavioral science are all in particular danger of losing funding, Locke wrote in a press release.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fund most climate research, said Baylor Fox-Kemper, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences. President Trump’s recently proposed budget cuts would, if carried out, make such agencies “incapable of doing their work,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The amount of money committed to the emergency fund “was based on the volume of research we currently have that is in these vulnerable areas,” Savitz said. The money, which will come from general University reserves, is meant to cover all of the current research that might face sudden cuts in the near future, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The amount of money allocated to researchers will depend on “what’s needed to bring the project to an orderly close,” Savitz said. The money will not be used to complete these projects, but will instead allow them to shut down systematically — ideally in a way that would allow them to restart if funding returns. For example, researchers would need time to archive data for future access, store specimens and pay laboratory assistants for their work, Savitz added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University had to create a similar emergency fund during the 2013 government shutdown and budget sequestration so that active projects could continue, Locke wrote, adding that “this (new) program is modeled on that earlier plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But budget changes during that period carried different implications about the allocation of research funding, Savitz said. While 2013 saw a temporary drop in government research funding, researchers now worry about permanent cuts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s a wonderful thing that we’re in a university that can afford to (provide emergency funds),” Fox-Kemper said. But the fund will not be able to address long-term cuts in funding, and such cuts could do extensive damage to progress in climate research and other fields that are at risk.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But Savitz believes that long-term gradual decreases in funding are “more likely to happen” and “more threatening” than an abrupt cut to resources. To prepare for this threat, the University is working to diversify its funding and seek support from private foundations and corporations. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The budget proposed by the Trump administration demonstrates an unsettling hostility toward climate science — and other sciences — from a government that, until recently, was its most important source of support, Fox-Kemper said, as “virtually all” of his field’s current funding comes from government sources. “I’m worried when non-scientists try to make decisions about what types of science are important,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most highly abused types of drugs in the United States is not bought on the street — it is prescribed by a doctor. This is what Perri Peltz ’82 P’19 set out to illuminate in her new documentary “Warning: This Drug May Kill You,” which premiered in Sayles Hall April 12. The movie will be released to the public May 1.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The HBO documentary set out to both bring awareness to the ongoing opioid epidemic in the country and generate a sense of empathy. “What I hope that we have done in this film is to provide a story of the humanity of people who are suffering. This is not a problem of drug abuse — this is a problem of addiction. These are good people who develop addictions to highly addictive drugs,” Peltz said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The opening scene of the film shows a montage of people who are high on opioids passing out in a number of scenarios. One person was sitting on a bus, one was driving a car and another was in the store with their child. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This was the first public screening of the film as well as the first time Peltz herself had seen the final product. “What we tried to do with this film is show the human side of (opioid addiction),” Peltz said, adding, “All too often we want to say that it’s happening to other people. Unfortunately, that’s not the case.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The film was followed by a panel that was, along with Peltz, hosted by Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health; Josiah Rich, professor of epidemiology as well as a member of Rhode Island’s Overdose Prevention and Intervention Task Force and Rebecca Boss, director of the Department of Behavioral Healthcare. They answered audience questions and provided their own perspectives on the epidemic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The documentary itself centered on four families, each coping with various forms of opioid addiction. While the subjects of these stories were all prescribed painkillers for different reasons, they were similar in one regard: They never intended to become addicted.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The film showcased in harrowing detail the ways in which prescription opioids ruin the lives of both those who take them and their families. The first story revolved around a girl named Stephany, who was prescribed painkillers when she was a teenager in order to cope with pain caused by kidney stones. The other stories were all told from the perspective of families who had already lost someone to opioids and depicted the grief they were attempting to overcome. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to the documentary, 91 people die from opioids every day in the United States, and opioid deaths have quadrupled since 1999.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rich explained that when one takes opioids, they begin to require more and more, and eventually an addiction forms, sometimes in under a week. As was the case in the documentary, people who are addicted will begin to take much more than was initially prescribed and sometimes even turn to heroin in order to increase their high.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When one stops taking opioids, they go into withdrawal, Rich said. This affects the “reptilian” part of the brain, which causes them to want to take opioids again. Rich likens this experience to someone holding their breath: Eventually, survival instincts will activate and force them to breathe. This is why the majority of opioid users who quit end up relapsing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the debilitating effects of the opioid epidemic, both the documentary and the panel discussed the methods that are in place to help people rehabilitate. Peltz discussed the use of Narcan, which is used to revive people who have overdosed on opioids. “People are actually dying, and (Narcan) is able to kick the opioid off of the receptors, and people are able to come back to life,” Peltz said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Rhode Island is one of the states most affected by opioids, Peltz says that it is also one of the leading states in the country in regard to combating the opioid epidemic. She noted the availability of Narcan and the restrictions in place for the prescription of opioids. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Peltz put particular focus on the stigma surrounding opioid addiction, pointing out that people sometimes wonder why addicts who continually overdose are being revived. Peltz stressed that the epidemic is not a case of bad people abusing good drugs, nor is it a moral failing; rather, it is a case of addiction, a brain disorder, to which she hopes the film will bring awareness.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Study challenges internet use, political polarization link</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">In the months surrounding the election, many were quick to place blame on the internet and social media for increased political polarization. But a new study by a University economist shows that the echo chambers of social media may not be so resonant after all.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In his <a href="https://www.brown.edu/Research/Shapiro/pdfs/age-polars.pdf">study</a>, Professor of Economics Jesse Shapiro found that internet and social media use have not contributed greatly to increased political polarization between 1996 and 2012.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To test this, Shapiro and co-authors Levi Boxell and Matthew Gentzkow from Stanford University used data from the American National Election Studies, which questions respondents about their political preferences, Boxell said. Researchers found that Americans aged 75 and older became more politically polarized over time than their younger counterparts but used social media less frequently.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Essentially what we see is that the people with the lowest exposure to internet have experienced the largest changes in polarization (from) 1996 to 2012,” Boxell said. This finding is counter to their hypothesis, as the researchers expected that younger Americans would experience more polarization.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The upward trend in political polarization is not limited to eras with internet use, Boxell said. “At least for the measures we looked at and the index we constructed, we see a consistent upwards trend in political polarization since 1972.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The paper did not address what could be causing the increased political polarization but emphasized that the trend occurs across all demographics. “It seems likely that whatever it is, (it’s) something that’s also demographically fairly broad,” Shapiro said. He <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/">cited</a> the United States’ growth in inequality as a possible contributing factor. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Our paper doesn’t rule out that the internet may play a role,” Boxell said. But if it does,“it’s most likely a small role relative to the overall big picture.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since the 2016 presidential election, political polarization in America has been a focus of national discussion. Though the researchers had been interested in these topics for a long time, “the election obviously brought them to the foreground and made it even more exciting to be working on these problems,” Shapiro said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Susan Short, director of the Population Studies and Training Center at Brown, which supported the research, echoed Shapiro’s statement and emphasized the need for scientific studies that investigate political trends.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Poll shows 39.8 percent of students oppose building performing arts center on UEL site</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The matrix pictured can be found <a href="http://datascience.heraldweb.org/projects/spring2017poll/html/matrix.html">here</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">The Herald’s spring undergraduate poll, conducted April 5-7 in J. Walter Wilson, the Stephen Roberts ’62 Campus Center and the Sciences Library, found that students reported a drop in religious activity while attending the University. While about 24 percent of students participated in religious activities, such as attending church, religious fellowships or religious associations before attending Brown, only about 10 percent reported doing so while attending the University. The number of students who participated in religious events once or twice a month before attendance dropped from 10.2 percent to 5.5. Similarly, 42.7 percent of students surveyed reported not actively participating in religious events before attending Brown. But 69.1 percent of students reported that they do not actively participate in religious events while at Brown.</p>
<p class="p3">Following the February announcement by the Corporation that the Urban Environmental Lab <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/26/planned-uel-demolition-invokes-criticism/">may face demolition</a> and the subsequent activism to save the building, about 40 percent of students strongly or somewhat disagree that the University should build a new performing arts center on the site of the current UEL. About 26 percent of surveyed students agreed that the performing arts center should be built, while about 34 percent had no opinion.</p>
<p class="p3">Following the Corporation’s February approval of a $1.061 billion operating budget plan for fiscal year 2018, which includes a 4.4 percent increase in undergraduate tuition and fees, the poll found that about 42 percent of students <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/12/corporation-approved-budget-aims-achieve-financial-stability/">disapprove of the way the University is handling the budget</a>. About 20 percent of students approved of the University’s handling of the budget, while about 38 percent had no opinion.</p>
<p class="p3">About 49 percent of students surveyed said they would feel comfortable going to the Title IX office, which handles cases of sexual and gender-based harassment, for assistance and support if they were ever in a situation that fell under its jurisdiction. Twenty five percent said they would feel uncomfortable going to the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/01/26/title-ix-program-officer-steps/">Title IX office for support</a>, while 17 percent said they had no opinion. The results come in light of the recent resignation of the University’s Title IX program officer, Amanda Walsh, which left management of the office to an interim director.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The student body is roughly split regarding the University’s governance. Fifty four percent of students approve of the way President Christina Paxson P’19 is handling her position as president of the University, with about 12 percent reporting disapproval and 34 percent without opinion. Similarly, 49 percent of students polled approve of the way the Undergraduate Council of Students is handling its job representing and addressing the concerns of the undergraduate student body. About seven percent of students polled disapproved of UCS and 42 percent lacked an opinion.</span></p>
<p class="p3">In a period in which students, specifically women and those from historically underrepresented groups, are questioning the impact of President Donald Trump’s election in their lives, 4.4 percent of students reported changing their birth control in response to the current political climate.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">Recent government attitudes have raised concerns about the future of science and spurred researchers and their advocates into taking action. Along with a number of Marches for Science taking place around the world April 22, Rhode Island will host its own event, beginning at the state house.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The march “has the endorsement of an enormous number of well-respected scientific organizations,” said Susan Gerbi, professor of biochemistry and an organizer for the March for Science RI.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The March for Science RI “advocates for publicly funded scientific research and evidence-based policies that are unrestricted by partisan politics, in solidarity with all who value science worldwide,” according to the mission statement on the march’s website.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The march is meant “to show that people support science and that they recognize the value of science in their lives,” said Rich Ribb, an organizer for the march in Rhode Island. “The funding for scientific research is under attack at this point, and people who do recognize that value are taking the opportunity to speak out about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A campus-wide email sent April 13 by Provost Richard Locke and Vice President for Research David Savitz echoed these sentiments. They stressed the importance of science in fulfilling the University’s mission to create successful scholars and emphasized the necessity of advocating for science. While the University does not generally sponsor participation in marches, it does recognize that they are a form of advocacy, according to the email.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While many organizations support marches, there have been concerns raised nationally about the politicization of science through these events. A Jan. 31 New York Times opinion titled, “A Scientists’ March on Washington is a Bad Idea” by Robert S. Young, a professor of coastal geology at Western Carolina University, claims that rather than persuading the government to support science, a march will only serve to reaffirm the notion that scientists are an “interest group.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But many University scientists do not share Young’s worries. Andrew Lynn GS, who is part of the Department of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences, said he has no immediate concerns about the march and that he plans on attending it “without reservation.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are in an era in which the way that people structure their beliefs around science is of concern,” Lynn said. “Maybe it is becoming a political issue, but I think that pretending that it’s not is potentially” a risk.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Michael Monn GS, who studies in the School of Engineering, is helping to organize a group of students who will attend the march in Boston. Advocating for any science is defending all sciences as well as the scientific process, Monn said. “To say ‘I don’t believe in climate change’ is to say ‘I don’t believe in the scientific method,’ and ‘I don’t believe in evidence to support hypotheses,’ and that is a more fundamental problem,’” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Christopher Kahler, professor of behavioral and social sciences, said that the purpose of this march is to advocate for policies in government and funding that would benefit science and to show the value of science to society as a whole. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I’m definitely in support of (the march),” said Joe Hogan, professor of biostatistics. Hogan also does not view science as political, but he sees science under attack by politicians. The marches are important in keeping the public aware of important scientific issues that should not be politicized, such as climate change and vaccinations, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Baylor Fox-Kemper, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences, is also an advocate for the march. The event is meant to reveal to people the ways in which science is important in their lives as well as the amount of support there is for science in the United States, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While he does have some concerns about the politicization of science, Ira Wilson, professor of health services, policy and practice, thinks that it is more important for scientists and its advocates to “stand up and be counted” in a time when science is being both ignored and politicized. Wilson will be attending the March for Science in Washington, D.C. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“As a scientist, I was never really involved in activism,” said Stephon Alexander, professor of physics, adding that the current political landscape has spurred him to “march to make sure the next generation of scientists have a fighting chance.” Alexander said that it would be hypocritical not to protest because science is inherently political, as researchers’ work are used to create weapons such as missiles. It would also be hypocritical for anyone to claim that they are against science because “if you use a cellphone, if you use an airplane, you’re trusting science,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The march is a response to the “perceived exclusivity of science,” as scientists want the general public to understand that everyone is part of the scientific endeavour, Alexander said. As a form of “local activism” to combat notions of science being elitist, he is also developing a fall 2017 course, PHYS 0150: “The Jazz of Modern Physics,” which is designed for students outside of the physics concentration and aims to make physics more approachable.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article misstated that Stephon Alexander is the chair of the physics department. Alexander is not chair of the department, rather he is a professor of physics. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Six successful female scientists delivered a series of public lectures on their work in various fields at Thursday’s day-long event<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Inspiring Women in Science 2017,” which explored research ranging from plate tectonics to polar ice mechanics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Associate Professor of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences Dima Amso, who created and helped plan the event, said her goal was “to provide standing, diverse women role models” for students considering entering a scientific field.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While previous symposia on campus have aimed to encourage diversity in the sciences, few have featured the breadth displayed by this event, said Diane Lipscombe, professor of neuroscience, director of the Brown Institute For Brain Science and member of the planning committee. The speakers were encouraged to focus on their work, though many chose to also address the challenges women in science often face, Amso said. The event was primarily meant to be a “celebration” of successful female scientists, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">President Christina Paxson P’19 gave remarks in the middle of the day, saying that progress has been made for equity in the sciences “in part because we have occasions like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Amso and Lipscombe worked to organize the event with Vice President for Academic Development, Diversity and Inclusion Liza Cariaga-Lo, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics Gelonia Dent and Professor of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences Sheila Blumstein.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The five planners identified a “wonderful crew of women who have made tremendous contributions to their field” and invited them to speak, Blumstein said, adding that they received an enthusiastic response from the invitees.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Carol Espy-Wilson, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Maryland, presented her work on computer voice recognition. Using a phonetic framework to categorize speech into a combination of vocal gestures, Espy-Wilson and her colleagues improved the accuracy of computer voice recognition programs. These advances could help tailor voice recognition for people who speak with accents, Espy-Wilson said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In her afternoon talk titled “A broader vision of vision,” Marlene Behrmann, professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, described her research on how the brain processes visual information about faces. Using complex analysis of subjects’ brain activity, Behrmann and her team were able to approximately reconstruct an image of a face that test subjects were shown during a brain scan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Behrmann also spoke about obstacles for women in science. Women are represented in peer review panels for scientific journals at about half the rate they are represented in their respective fields, Behrmann said, adding that while it is “a glorious time to be doing science, … it could be even more glorious.” Even in fields where women are represented equally at the undergraduate level, there is still a smaller proportion of women in higher levels of academia, Amso said. One way to respond to the problem of under-representation is to showcase the contributions that female scientists have already made, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> “Yes, things are better for women in science, but perhaps equally important, things are better in science because of women,” Paxson said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not even the rain could keep a crowd of over 1,500 “nerds” away from Saturday’s March for Science Rhode Island at the State House, noted J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and speaker at the march. In light of President Trump’s proposed policies that would threaten scientific research and impact climate change, Rhode Island scientists and their supporters gathered to listen to speakers, hold signs and advocate scientific research within the context of several sister marches throughout the country that threw science into political discourse.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Susan Gerbi, professor of biochemistry, reaffirmed that the march did not aim to be partisan. “It’s even problematic that it’s called a march, because that sounds like a resistance movement,” Gerbi said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rather, the march was meant to demonstrate the benefits of science to society. “That should be taken into consideration by politicians when they are making a national policy,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gerbi said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Still, the march called into question many partisan platforms, including the Republican propensity to deny climate change and some of Trump’s more specific policies outlined in his proposed budget, which would defund the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent and cut funding for the National Institutes of Health by 18 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rhode Island politicians also made appearances. “Sound decisions must be made on sound science,” wrote U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D-RI in a statement read at the march.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Zoe Goris, a speaker at the march, discussed decisions made by the Trump administration and how they negatively impact science. “I want to live in a world that has brought back value to logic, to accountability and to basic empirical reasoning. I want to live in a world that has reaffirmed science’s large role on public health and legislation. I want to live in a world where the scorching of our earth is not met with thunderous applause,” Goris said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Scientists need to attend to justice, or we won’t get anywhere,” Roberts said. <span class="Apple-converted-space">           </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though people’s reasons for attending the march varied, many stemmed from concern for the state of science.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’ve always respected science, and I think it’s important to send that message to the present administration because they seem a little confused,” said Glen Bennet, another attendee, who mentioned he would like to see the government reverse its position on the EPA and respect scientists.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nate Klimpert, a volunteer for the March for Science, said he assists with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a number of science-related events. “I just want to let people know that there is an Earth that is worth protecting,” Klimpert said, adding that his interest in science began when he was young. “Someone told me I could ask questions for a living, and that sounded really cool to me, so now I’ve just committed to doing that.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think it’s important that we stand up (against) some irrational beliefs that our president is advocating. I think it a big shame and a travesty that our president is undermining the scientific community by trying to cut all funding from it,” said David Meisels, a physician who also attended the march.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both scientists and their families were in attendance. “Doesn’t everybody care about science?” said Greg Sargent, a behavior scientist, who attended the march with his young daughter, Penelope. Sargent said their sign, which read “Bugs not Bombs,” meant to tie in a scientific interest he and his daughter share. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He explained that Penelope felt very strongly about what the current administration was doing to defund science, including placing Scott Pruitt as the director of the EPA. She suggested that, instead of building golf courses, Trump build an endangered animal reserve.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article misstated that Susan Gerbi, professor of biochemistry, was an organizer for the march. While Gerbi helped to organize a contingent of Brown community members who attended the march, she was not an organizer. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">For several years, researchers have been trying to formulate the best way to quickly detect an infection in open wounds without relying on time-consuming tests. Bacterial infection numbers among the world’s leading causes of death, and thus it must be quickly detected to proceed with effective antibiotic treatment. Anita Shukla, assistant professor of engineering and molecular pharmacology, physiology and biotechnology, worked with Roya Sheybani, former Hibbitt Engineering Post-Doctoral Fellow, to develop a sensor that could perform this kind of rapid identification of wound bacteria.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Previous attempts at developing such infection detection biosensors have resulted in lengthy identification times, insufficient sensitivity to bacteria and dependence on unwieldy equipment that makes sensors difficult to wear, according to the article.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Some sensors measure the acidity of the wound, while others monitor the number of bacteria that attach themselves to the sensor, Shukla said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Typically with these kinds of sensors, (researchers) are using just one approach,” she added. Their research couples the two factors to provide more information, as acidity alone does not provide much information about the wound.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A shift in acidity could just be a response to a body change, but “when you couple it with an attachment sensor, it very specifically tells you that bacteria are attaching, and the pH can tell you a little more about what kind of bacteria these are.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sensor’s method for detecting bacteria is “very effective,” said Darius Rackus, a PhD student at the University of Toronto who was cited in the researchers’ article. “(The sensor) is measuring two very different things,” Rackus said. In addition to monitoring the presence of bacteria in the wound through cell attachment, the sensor can also offer information about the growth of these bacteria through the pH measurement, Rackus added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To monitor bacterial cell attachment, the sensors measure how easily current passes through the tissue, Sheybani said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the wound,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“a small alternating current can be applied across the electrodes through a range of frequencies,” allowing the researchers to observe how much bacteria hinders the current, Sheybani said. “The presence of bacteria in the solution and their subsequent attachment to the sensor surface causes a shift in the measured impedance,” and these measured values are correlated to bacteria concentration, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the device is a significant advancement in the field of biotechnology, its use could be limited at this level of development. The device was built on glass, but to measure bacteria in a live wound, it would need to work on a more flexible substance, Shukla said. Most of the processes used to create the sensor can be applied to soft materials like bandages, she added. “Our hope and our hypothesis is that we won’t run into major issues, but you never know — there could be problems in transferring it to a more biomedically relevant substrate.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sensor may not be ready for testing in animals just yet, Rackus said. But hopefully, the sensor will be embedded in soft materials and can progress to live testing, Shukla said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shukla and Sheybani attempted to limit the sensor’s cost. “You can imagine that would be important for using it in a setting where you can’t really afford expensive equipment,” Shukla said. “The goal eventually is to also make the sensor output completely wireless so that you don’t even need to carry around any special equipment.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Event series explores fire in landscapes, history, art</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">The true nature of fire may come as a surprise, said Stephen Pyne, author of many books detailing fire’s history in the evolution of our planet and the modern United States. Many people today lack experience with fire beyond birthday candles and fireplace flames, but Pyne has investigated the powerful element through many years as a firefighter in national parks and a fire-focused academic career.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pyne will offer a keynote address April 27 distilling his knowledge of fire’s history and the evolving relationship between humans and fire. The talk, one of the final installments of the Institute for Environment and Society’s event series “What Fire Does,” will discuss the wide range of uses and understandings of fire that have developed over time.</span></p>
<p class="p4">People have distanced themselves from fire in recent history, relying on machines to light and fight fires instead of starting them ourselves. “Now we’re tipping into a new era in which the belief that we could prescribe fire is not working — it’s too expensive, too cumbersome, too legally entangled,” Pyne said. The state of the planet calls for a reduction of fossil fuel burning and a return to humans’ more personal relationship with fire as it was in the past, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Some talks in the series also focused on fire in the modern American landscape. Alissa Cordner, assistant professor of sociology at Whitman College, addressed how wildfires are too often treated as problems when they serve important functions in nature. Thomas Pringle GS analyzed media depictions of fire as they related to climate change, underlining the persuasive power held by the images.</p>
<p class="p4">Artistic approaches to fire were rife within the series of events. Photos of fires at Standing Rock protests complemented a discussion of the ways the NoDAPL movement resembled the form of a fire, beginning with disparate sparks and growing into a consuming flame around which protesters congregated. “People came from all over the world to gather at this fire,” said Elizabeth Hoover, assistant professor of American studies. “They felt compelled, they felt moved.”</p>
<p class="p4">Fire-related exhibitions were also held at the John Carter Brown Library and the Nature Lab, offering displays of fire’s history and transformational abilities.</p>
<p class="p4">A more immersive exploration of fire in art took place in the Rhode Island School of Design’s glass shop, where students and faculty crafted miniature volcanoes in a glass casting demonstration Wednesday. Clad in protective silver aprons and sleeves, the artists poured molten glass onto heaps of dirt to build irregular cone shapes that glowed red with heat. The myths, history and science tied to volcanoes convinced the artists to cast their likenesses, said Camille Cady, a glass student at RISD.</p>
<p class="p4">Materials ranging from sawdust to orange peels to fireworks were fed into the mouths of the volcanoes, where they ignited and burned, sometimes sending flames feet into the air. Observers watched the construction of several little volcanoes, whose ominous presence diminished after the flames died out and the glass cooled into a fixed shape.</p>
<p class="p4">The form of the volcano evokes a sense of reverence and amazement, said Jocelyne Prince, associate professor at RISD. Fire is often thought about as something wild and dangerous, but this project was designed to show off fire’s more enjoyable forms instead of labeling it as destructive, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">Though researchers, artists and firefighters interact with fire in different ways, there is no complete form of control over the flames, Prince said. “It does what it wants to,” she added. “It is what permits transformation.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The University honored six faculty members for their research with the inaugural Brown Research Achievement Awards April 19. Various departments nominated a total of several dozen candidates and a panel of faculty members narrowed down the list. The winners, which included both senior and early-career faculty members, received a certificate from the University and a $5,000 award.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University has made great strides to improve the scale and quality of research in recent years and wanted to celebrate the success of that endeavor, wrote David Savitz, vice president for research and professor of epidemiology, obstetrics and gynecology, in an email to The Herald. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We see these awards as an opportunity to celebrate the remarkable achievements of the faculty as leading researchers,” Savitz wrote. “Their research accomplishments are central to their roles as educators and contributors to both the academic community at Brown and to addressing societal challenges.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Applied Mathematics Constantine Dafermos and Professor of Health Services, Policy and Practice Vincent Mor won the Distinguished Research Achievement Award, which recognizes faculty members who have contributed a variety of nationally recognized research while at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dafermos’ research has focused on nonlinear hyperbolic systems, an area of mathematics that helps explain how shockwaves work and bridges the gap between mechanics and partial differential equations. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s a very good idea for the University to try to celebrate research activities at Brown because there is tremendous research activity here,” Dafermos said. These awards help recognize individuals who create high-quality work and allow researchers from different disciplines learn about research in other fields, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mor has worked extensively on improving the quality of care in nursing homes across the country. Analyzing national information about nursing homes, Mor has conducted research on identifying factors that can help improve the quality of care within these homes, such as the availability of doctors and nurses throughout the facility. Mor said he was honored by the recognition from the University and his peers, adding that he hopes to use the award to help fund a student for the summer. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Computer Science Maurice Herlihy received the Research Innovation Award for his work in distributed computing, a technique for improving the speed of multicore processors, which have become increasingly prevalent in recent years. His work helped bridge the gap between software and hardware and has been adopted by a variety of companies, including Intel and IBM. Herlihy said he plans on using the award money to attend innovative conferences. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tim Kraska, assistant professor of computer science, Joseph Braun, assistant professor of epidemiology and Susan Moffitt, associate professor of political science and international and public affairs, were awarded the Early Career Research Achievement Awards — given to faculty members who have produced cutting edge research during their few years at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kraska has focused on “democratizing data science” over the last few years, working to make data science accessible to everybody, not just those with extensive education and training. He has helped develop a variety of tools to make data science easier to understand and visualize. Winning the award “shows me that we are on the right track with our research agenda,” Kraska said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Braun has focused his research on a group of children in Cincinnati, tracking individuals with low-level exposure to a variety of chemicals since birth. He is hoping to create a general profile of an individual with low-level exposure throughout their lifetime, tracking progressive changes in their health. Braun plans to bring more students into his research with the award and said he was honored to be recognized for his work from the last few years.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University plans on continuing the awards, though the categories and number of awards distributed may vary in years to come, Savitz wrote.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In an effort to combat the growing international water crisis, 54 scholars and scientists from across the globe recently signed the Geneva Actions on Human Water Security, a document backed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization that stipulates clean water access as a basic human right.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The declaration delineates three actions to help ensure global water security: first, to “secure the delivery of basic water needs for people;” second, to “secure the improvements in the condition of watersheds, streams, rivers and aquifers” and, third, to “secure better water planning, management and governance.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The document called for the establishment of the Global Human Water Security Fund of 27 billion per year, or enough to provide 1 cent per person per day, said Amanda Lynch, director of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, professor of environment and society and of earth, environmental and planetary sciences and one of the founding signatories of the declaration. The U.S. government would contribute to the fund in the same way it does to other humanitarian funds, she added. “We need water for life, and it’s becoming increasingly problematic for people to access,” Lynch said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We need to do something more proactive about implementing this idea,” said Gabriel Eckstein, professor of law at the Texas A&amp;M School of Law and another of the founding signatories, about the fund. “Every person is entitled to some amount of good quality fresh water.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The amount of humanitarian and environmental damage attributed to inadequate clean water access is vast, according to Eckstein and Nathaniel Matthews, program director at the Global Resilience Partnership and another of the founding signatories. The dearth of clean water access has caused the deaths of millions of children and a top source of diseases around the world.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There are 2.5 billion people without access to improved sanitation,” Matthews said, highlighting water’s integrality to many different issues, such as agriculture, food security and energy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Lynch emphasized that inadequate water is not the problem; rather, it is an issue with effective use, appropriate governance, pollution and corruption. “We actually hold in our hands the ability for everyone to have access to sufficient clean water. It’s a worthy priority because it is attainable,” Lynch said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Eckstein stressed the importance of having a well-rounded team of experts to work on this issue from different directions. As a lawyer, he offers a legal perspective, while others in the group view the issue through other lenses, such as scientific or economic ones. Subsequently, Eckstein views access to clean water as a legal right and considers it necessary for governments to recognize this and adjust their own domestic laws.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lynch said that she and the rest of the signatories were advocating with UNESCO to create the fund and, as all of the signatories come from different parts of the world, to their respective federal and state governments to contribute to it. Each signatory was asked to identify key priorities or actions and analyze the key issues associated with priority geographies, Matthews said. “We’ll work together as a group to find some substantive areas to address water security around the planet,” Matthews said. He hopes this project will create momentum that allows global water security for people and ecosystems to remain a priority with policymakers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Lynch, since the declaration’s presentation in July, the founding signatories have shared it with media and local representatives and have met with government officials. “Each of us agreed that we would not only sign the document, but that we would take action,” Lynch said. As far as Lynch’s own efforts, she said she has been working with the Australian government encouraging them to contribute, and she is hoping to meet with Rhode Island senators.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The group has also already seen support outside of UNESCO. Eckstein cited a conference at the Vatican to which the signatories were invited in February as an inspirational milestone in their fight for universal clean water. “The pope is extremely sympathetic to this issue, and we were highly impressed and humbled that he took time out of his schedule to come to this conference,” Eckstein said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Eckstein explained that the major disconnect between clean water availability in the United States and in less developed countries has caused people to lose perspective on the true value of water. He cited Ben Franklin’s quote: “When the well is dry, we know the worth of water.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3">On July 1, Professor of Mathematics Jill Pipher became the new vice president for research for the University, in which she coordinates funding and monitors all research conducted at the University. The office aims to have a university-wide view of research on campus rather than a focus on a specific department.</p>
<p class="p4">Pipher outlined three main goals for her tenure: increasing funding for research, expanding commercial engagement and continuing “operational excellence” within her office.</p>
<p class="p4">Pipher will face an uphill battle to secure federal funding. Research dollars have remained roughly flat over the last five years, yet inflation and the rising cost of conducting research has meant that budgets for projects have been strained across the board, Pipher said. While Pipher will continue to visit Washington once a month to meet with members of Congress to encourage them to support research funding, she plans on turning more to other funding sources such as philanthropic and commercial institutions. Pipher will also face challenges from other competing research universities that are similarly turning to alternative funding sources, said David Savitz, professor of epidemiology and Pipher’s predecessor as vice president for research.</p>
<p class="p4">Pipher’s focus on expanding commercial partnerships and engagement will be aided by the recent hire of Daniel Behr as the executive director of corporate relations. Behr, who has headed the newly created Office of Corporate Relations since July 1, oversees all of the university’s efforts to create and expand relationships with outside corporations. While the university had previously engaged with the commercial sector in multiple departments under Savitz, Pipher has tried to <span class="s3">centralize the process. “The mission of this new office is to unleash the impact of Brown’s research by encouraging and facilitating the evolution of Brown discoveries and inventions into products and services that will add an economic value,” Pipher said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Other universities have expanded their partnerships with the commercial sector in recent years as federal research funding has become increasingly tight. Recently, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and IBM announced a $240 million partnership to advance artificial intelligence research, one of the largest par</span>tnerships between academic and commercial institutions. Though critics have argued that such partnerships undermine the academic integrity of researchers and can create a bias toward market-ready products and short-te<span class="s3">rm projects, both Pipher and Savitz said that Brown attempts to avoid conflicts of interest. While doing research under commercial agreements, for example, researchers must sign contracts guaranteeing that the research will be published regardless of the impact on the commercial partner, Pipher said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pipher was previously the founding director of the Institute of Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, a position she held from 2010 to 2016. Under her direction, the institute received both founding and operational grants from the National Science Foundation — establishing it as one of eight NSF-funded mathematical sciences institutes in the country — as well as a number of other grants from both federal and commercial sources. Pipher also coordinated numerous semester long programs, which brought together over a thousand researchers during her tenure.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brendan Hassett, who took over Pipher’s position as director of ICERM in July 2016, praised Pipher’s long-term planning and coordinating abilities. “When I started at ICERM, there were a lot of things that I thought, ‘Oh, you could never get this to work.’ But she was very persistent and very proactive, and, in almost every case, she got it to work,” Hassett said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Savitz seconded this praise, adding that Pipher “has a combination of scholarly vision and administrative skills.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pipher also brings a unique perspective to the office as one of the few female researchers in STEM. “I don’t think there has been as much progress as I would have hoped in diversity, in science, in academia,” Pipher said. “There’s still a lot of work to be done to understand the causes, to find the remedies, to support women and other underrepresented minorities in (STEM) fields. It’s always something I’ve got on my mind.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a first step, Pipher plans on raising awareness of these gaps. “Awareness of unconscious bias and of the implications of being a minority is helpful. There are certain situations in which reminding people that these factors exist can help change the tone of a meeting, conversation or direction that things go,” Pipher said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pipher will continue teaching, mentoring and researching during her tenure, serving as a co-professor for MATH 0750: “Introduction to Higher Mathematics” and furthering her work in mathematics.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Throughout her time in various positions throughout the University, Pipher has held one belief dear: “My common thread is my passion and respect for university research, in particular the research at Brown.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Study projects climate change to increase heat-related deaths</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">It’s easy to conceptualize climate change as distant environmental shifts in the future. But a recent study led by University researchers, along with others, showed U.S. mortality rates will increase in coming decades as result of climate change. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study examined the relationship between temperature and deaths in 10 large metropolitan areas in the United States, said Antonio Gasparinni, associate professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who did much of the statistical work for the team. The researchers confirmed that as temperatures rise, heat-related deaths, like those from heatstroke, increase, while cold-related deaths, like those from hypothermia, decrease. Next, they decided to tackle the question of whether net deaths would increase or decrease overall.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In eight of the 10 metropolitan areas, researchers found that an increase in heat-related deaths would be larger than the decrease in cold-related deaths, leaving a net increase in mortalities.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After estimating the statistical curve of heat-based mortalities among the 10 cities based on historical data, the team obtained several projections for the future, Gasparinni said. These projections were based on various potential emissions scenarios, each of which fueled climate change to a different degree. Two main scenarios were examined in the paper — one “business as usual” scenario, which looked at the effects of climate change if humans continued emitting as they do now, and another scenario in which efforts were taken to curb emissions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite the projected increase in human deaths, a silver lining still exists­— in comparing the two emissions scenarios, the team saw that a substantial number of those deaths could be avoided if the human population adheres to the lower emissions scenario. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Experts whose work deals with climate change agreed that the results of this study present a stark portrait of the future humans are going to face.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This study shows a reality we’ll have to get used to because we have relatively high confidence in temperature projections,” said Amir AghaKouchak, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at University of California Irvine. “We need to expect more from our policy makers than expecting people to automatically do something about those things,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This study presents not only a public health argument for mitigating climate change, but also an opportunity to think about adaptation to climate,” said Kate Weinberger, lead author and postdoctoral fellow in Brown’s Institute for Environment and Society. “What can we do — is it opening cooling centers, warning people about heat waves, planting more trees or planning city infrastructure in a way that produces good effects?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Especially in today’s political climate with its current debate surrounding climate change, this area of research can “provide some clear scientific evidence on the issue and make it less abstract,” Gasparinni said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">Adam Blumenthal,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>adjunct associate professor of the practice of computer science and virtual reality artist-in-residence, has been working with a team of students to create a virtual reality educational experience about the Gaspee Affair, a maritime attack that preceded the Revolutionary War. The work began when Blumenthal led a Group Independent Study Project with 14 students in the spring, and some have continued working on the project with hopes of releasing an alternative way of teaching high school history as soon as next year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team sees virtual reality as a way to immerse students in learning. In a 2016 Gallup Poll, about a third of American high school students claimed that they were engaged with school while the remaining two-thirds responded they were either “not engaged” or “actively disengaged” with school.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “Virtual reality is very engaging medium,” Blumenthal said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s a great way to deliver an experience as compelling as a video game and, at the same time, deliver learning outcomes for middle school and high school students.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Aside from the event’s exciting nature with cannon fire and gunshots, Blumenthal said he decided to focus on the Gaspee Affair due to its significance to the people of Providence. “The story is also very little-known outside of Rhode Island, but was very important in terms of the way that it helped unite the colonies towards the cause of independence,” Blumenthal said, adding that he hopes the Gaspee Project will elevate the story’s publicity on a national level.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> The Gaspee Project features an interactive virtual exhibit with a collection of items related to different aspects of the Gaspee Affair. Interacting with these objects transports the user to different parts of the virtual experience. For example, one part of the experience involves a small model of the Gaspee, a British ship, on a table. When a user picks up the model, they are transported to Gaspee Point, the site of the event, with the ability to see and experience the burning of the Gaspee.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Hannah Seckendorf ’20, a student on the team, said that users are also given the opportunity to teleport onto the ship’s deck. “That’s one of the powerful things about virtual reality,” she said. “It allows you to view the event through all the different perspectives involved, depending on where you are standing and experiencing the virtual space.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Brown has been committed to the development and research of virtual reality since the 1990s and now has multiple labs on campus dedicated to the technology. David Laidlaw, professor of computer science, has been a central figure of this initiative in recent years. His class, CSCI 1370: “Virtual Reality Design for Science,” gives students an opportunity to design interactive experiences using the virtual reality facilities on campus.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “The class focuses on developing good tools for scientists to understand things they don’t understand in big data sets,” Laidlaw said. “Its goal is also for students to understand what (virtual reality) can do, understanding its strengths and weaknesses in communication, education, science and so on. Over time, students learn subtle yet valuable lessons about the medium.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Though the upward trajectory that virtual reality has experienced in both popularity and development is encouraging for all those involved with this technology, there are still concerns about its potential to impact the masses and change the way we live.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “Virtual reality is very much still in its infancy,” said Jarod Boone ’20, another student involved with the Gaspee Project. “Aside from the logistical and technical problems that are still present in (virtual reality), there is still a cultural shift that needs to happen for people to be more accepting of (virtual reality).”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> While its success in education or other fields remains to be seen, there is a general consensus among all those involved in the project about the engaging facets of virtual reality.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “There’s a magic in (virtual reality), and it’s subtle,” Laidlaw said. “I don’t understand it, but we can recognize it when we see it. That’s my favorite part about (virtual reality).”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New Med School program educates students on opioid addiction</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Amid the statewide and nationwide opioid epidemic, the Alpert Medical School is shaping its curriculum to prepare students to treat opioid misuse disorder. Recently, it worked with the Rhode Island Department of Health to guarantee its graduates the ability to prescribe buprenorphine and medications that contain it, including Suboxone, which are used to treat opioid dependence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Around 30 students in the Med School’s class of 2018 participated in the approved curriculum, and the curriculum is being taught to all students in the class of 2019, said Paul George, assistant dean of medical education. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Compared to medication-assisted therapy that involves methadone, which requires treatment in a clinic, “suboxone is less regimented,” said Aaron Shapiro MD ’19. “You go to a pharmacy to fill your prescription, and you take it like you would take other medications. But it has the same kind of effect (as methadone),” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But most doctors cannot prescribe medications containing buprenorphine. Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000, doctors may only prescribe buprenorphine after completing an eight-hour training course that usually requires a cost of around $200 to $400 to receive a DATA waiver, George said. Spending eight hours away from work presents a significant barrier to practicing physicians, said Rachel Ellenbogen ’11 MD ’18.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In response to these issues, the Med School sought to prepare all students to treat opioid misuse disorders before graduation and developed a “robust curriculum around pain management,” George said. The curriculum, which is 23 hours long over the course of four years, covers the physiology of pain, pain management, the pharmacology of opioids and field work involving opioids. The Med School’s curriculum approaches opioid misuse in a way that is “longitudinal and in many ways more comprehensive” than the typical eight-hour training, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Alpert Medical School successfully received the DATA waiver training by applying to the Rhode Island Department of Health’s program. It is “the first school in the country that has had its curriculum approved by a state medical board,” as sufficient to warrant a DATA waiver, said James McDonald, chief administrative officer of the Rhode Island Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s really great that we have the exposure to treating addiction in medical school. … It exposes a lot of people who maybe wouldn’t think about treating addiction or addiction as a medical issue to thinking about what you can do as a physician to help your patients with addiction,” added Ellenbogen, who went through the curriculum.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For now, Med School graduates are only licensed to prescribe buprenorphine in Rhode Island. But George said that the Med School has been in conversation with other state health departments about establishing reciprocity for DATA waivers. The Department of Health would work with other states to show the process doctors at the Med School go through to get DATA waivers if requested, McDonald said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the nation comes to terms with the opioid epidemic, approaches to treatment are changing on both a legal and social level. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which administers DATA waivers, recently raised the maximum number of patients to which a doctor with a DATA waiver can prescribe buprenorphine to 275 after at least two years with the waiver. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Attitudes about opioid misuse disorder are also changing as programs like the one at the Med School approach this disorder as they would treat any chronic illness, McDonald said. “How physicians look at pain, even though pain is subjective, is important. And how physicians and the patient look at people who suffer from substance misuse disorder is important, too,” he added. McDonald noted that stigma surrounding substance misuse disorder, like the label “junkie,” is unproductive. “People who suffer from a chronic disease really need help,” he said. What helps “people who are suffering from (substance misuse disorder) is getting medication-assisted treatment and getting into recovery.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Alzheimer’s study may provide methods of prevention, economical diagnosis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"> A trial currently being conducted by University professors at Butler and Rhode Island Hospital may be key to diagnosing Alzheimer’s at an accessible cost before the symptoms appear. The trial has two main focuses: to test whether the drug Solanezumab can delay memory loss and to determine whether a retinal scan can detect the plaque buildup.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The implications of this study could be huge ­— scientists may be able to not only delay or prevent memory loss, but also potentially diagnose it before it manifests using a simple retinal scan at the eye doctor, said Stephen Salloway, professor of neurology, who is leading the study.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Because the retina contains nervous system tissue just like the brain, the amyloid plaque buildup that causes Alzheimer’s may be reflected in the retina, said to Peter Snyder, professor of neurology and surgery. Snyder’s research, which largely inspired this trial, was the first to look at the correlation between the eye and the brain in potential Alzheimer’s patients before they started showing symptoms.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“My hope is to ultimately intervene as early as possible,” Synder said. “Currently, by the time we’re able to diagnose the disease, it’s quite possible that too much damage has already taken place.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While there are genetic markers for Alzheimer’s, they don’t necessarily guarantee having or not having the disease, Snyder said. In pushing the diagnosis window earlier, to people who may get the disease in five, 10 or 15 years, Alzheimer’s medications that currently fail could be more effective.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study also carries a public health implication. PET scans, which predict a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s, cost roughly $4,500 dollars and are not available to most of the world. But if retinal imaging, which costs around $50 per subject, were able to accurately predict Alzheimer’s risks, it would offer “an inexpensive and available way of identifying diagnostics for many areas of the world that don’t have access to highly sophisticated neural imaging,” Snyder said. It uses the same simple technology that an optometrist would use to detect glaucoma or macular degeneration, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The parent trial testing the drug Solanezumab, which draws from the community of people who currently have normal memory, mandates at least four and a half years of treatment, according to Salloway. The sub-study examining the retina to test its ability to predict Alzheimer’s risk, which began just a few months ago, will last at least as long.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Alzheimer’s is one of the most important clinical problems we face given that the number of people likely to be affected over the next 20, 30 years will increase,” Salloway said. With the resources and researchers at Brown, a leading center in imaging the eye for Alzheimer’s disease, he hopes to detect Alzheimer’s in an economical way.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Though institutional corruption may seem like something of the past, researchers from Edward J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard examined how corruption remains prevalent today in a study published in the Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal. The study outlined the various aspects of corruption among institutions, including defining institutional corruption, tracing the different ways it arises and analyzing possible ways to remedy the issue.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Jonathan Koralnik, a student at Washington University in St. Louis and one of the study’s lead authors, said he was driven to write this paper because institutional corruption is widespread and damaging to society, though many are unaware of it. The paper was meant to raise certain questions in regard to institutional corruption, and subsequently elicit academic feedback and bring in a number of insights that would tackle the issue, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study initially cites a definition of institutional corruption by Dennis Thompson: “political gain or benefit by a public official under conditions that in general tend to promote private interests.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lawrence Lessig, professor of leadership at Harvard and a co-author of the study, expounds upon this in the paper, explaining that institutional corruption exists when something legally influences an institution to undermine its purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Institutional corruption is different from other types of corruption, such as personal corruption, in that it requires institutional actors, according to Seamus Miller, one of the directors of the Center for Applied Ethics and Public Ethics. There are some acts that are “quintessentially corrupt,” such as bribery, nepotism and abuse of authority, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Koralnik shared these sentiments, emphasizing that institutional corruption necessitates the involvement of a network of people to make the corruption possible. If a congressman accepts donations that sway legislative decisions, though there is one person at the focus, there are many people that take part.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the issue of how institutional corruption arises is complex, Koralnik said. It begins when external funding causes institutions to depart from their original purposes; for this reason, it is difficult to stop, Koralnik said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Miriam Müthel, chair of organizational behavior at the WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management and one of the authors of the study, said that institutional corruption causes a loss of trust, which is evident in increasingly negative public perceptions of institutions. Better understanding of institutional corruption would allow for better means to fight it and an increase in public trust, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There are methods to potentially prevent institutional corruption, Koralnik said. For example, blind funding in the medical field allows those who conduct research to not be influenced by those who fund the research. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Marianna Fotaki, professor of business ethics at Warwick Business School and former network fellow at the Safra Center, said that the paper gives a good overview of institutional corruption and its unique features. But it was largely centered around the United States, she said, and ignores many aspects of institutional corruption that are prevalent in the international sphere, such as globalization and deregulation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Philip Nichols, professor of social responsibility in business at the Wharton School, said that the paper attempted to use a definition of institutional corruption that was too broad to be able to find solutions or explain some specific instances. He also wished that the researchers had better explained some elements, like the paper’s particular use of trust regarding institutions, and had addressed more of the existing research.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Correction: A previous version of this article said that the study was published in the Southern California Institutional Law Journal. In fact, it was published in the Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal. The Herald regrets the error.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Your memes may be capable of downloading even faster — although you might have to wait a generation or two for the technology.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The Federal Communications Commission has approved the University as the first testing site for wireless communication using ultra-fast terahertz frequencies, which could bring in a new era of rapid communication.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Consumers currently only use Terahertz waves, sometimes called T-rays, very rarely in technological applications. Neither a high-frequency wave like visible light nor a low-frequency wave like microwaves, T-rays don’t have many obvious applications. Though they cannot be detected by the human eye, they are not a small enough wavelength to easily pass data through large objects.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Today, data on a 4G device is transmitted using gigahertz waves, which have a smaller frequency than Terahertz waves and cannot transmit as much data. Data speeds are currently limited to a maximum of around 400 megabytes per second.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">As more everyday objects are connected to the web and take up bandwidth, a new way to transmit data is needed, said Professor Michael Shur of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a researcher in the field. Terahertz technology could be used to facilitate communications between your computer, fridge, phone, thermostat and any other household appliances.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Daniel Mittleman, professor of engineering and the principal investigator for Brown’s research lab on Terahertz, imagines that in the future, someone might be able to approach a kiosk equipped with terahertz technology where a user could download an 8K movie in a second, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mittleman is “one of the internationally recognized leaders in terahertz research,” Shur said. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In an experiment using a terahertz multiplexer, which sends multiple signals along a single channel, researchers in Mittleman’s lab were able to transmit data at around 50 gigabytes per second, roughly 120 times faster than current speeds.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At first, Mittleman was not sure his request to test the waves on campus would be successful. “We wanted to push the FCC to think about it. People in Japan, Europe and China are already testing these frequencies, and we wanted the FCC to respond,” Mittleman said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mittleman’s group will begin outdoor tests this fall, sending data wirelessly in various locations around campus. While the experiments will begin in good weather, the group hopes to test different weather conditions and situations to see how the terahertz waves are affected, Mittleman said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">While some in the field have said that terahertz communication is impossible in the rain due to the way it interacts with the waves, Mittleman thinks otherwise. “We are going to prove them wrong,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mittleman’s research group continues to publish work around terahertz waves, focusing on areas such as terahertz radiation and spectroscopy to study nano-materials.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Thanks to a $19 million grant from the National Science Foundation, the University of Rhode Island will head a consortium of eight major universities in the Ocean State to study the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, develop improved technologies to detect any changes and seek to predict future activity around the Narragansett Bay through computer models.</p>
<p class="p2">The initiative, formally titled the Rhode Island Consortium for Coastal Ecology, Assessment, Innovation and Modeling, consists of a five-year plan that seeks to dig into the already-observed impacts of climate change on Narragansett Bay.</p>
<p class="p2">“We know that there has been some sea level rise, and we know that the waters outside the state have been warming,” said Baylor Fox-Kemper, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences. “There have also been predictions that the Northeast will continue getting wetter and warmer with climate change, which has impacts on the biological, physical and human aspects of the bay’s ecosystem. What we’d like to know is what kind of impacts these changes will present so we can better predict and prepare for them in the future.”</p>
<p class="p2">Studying Narragansett Bay will benefit the state economically as well as scientifically.</p>
<p class="p2">“The Narragansett Bay is a critical component of the state’s economy,” said Lew Rothstein, professor of oceanography at URI. “Understanding it and nurturing it in the face of climate change is interesting not only from a scientific standpoint, but also for the economy of the state.”</p>
<p class="p2">Fox-Kemper cited the historical significance of the bay as one of the key reasons why researchers are continuing to invest in the area. “We have historical data from all around the bay to draw from. Through the research that had been done on the bay in the past, we will be able to take this to the next step and build on the knowledge we have with this enhancement.”</p>
<p class="p2">URI will lead this project, which involves scientists from Brown, Bryant University, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence College, Rhode Island College, Roger Williams University and Salve Regina University.</p>
<p class="p2">As part of this five-year initiative, the Rhode Island C-AIM plans to build an observatory to study the bay. Through the data collected, researchers hope to construct complex models of these observations while implementing visualization and imaging techniques. Parts of the grant will also be dedicated to funding research and development of innovative equipment and technology, with hopes of achieving greater accuracy and resolution.</p>
<p class="p2">“Any politician in Rhode Island should understand the importance of the bay, and the importance of managing the bay,” said Jeffrey Morgan, professor of medicine and engineering. “Our hope is that the better models we create with this project will lead to better management practices for the bay, and will allow the constituents of Rhode Island to realize the importance of the bay.”</p>
<p class="p2">Members of the initiative were optimistic about the research’s scientific approach to predicting the impacts of climate variability, as well as its goal to increase awareness about the importance of such changes.</p>
<p class="p2">“Data centers will be developed throughout the five years,” Fox-Kemper said. “All of this data that is collected from the observatory and modeled is going to be made available online for anyone to see. The hope is that we, (in) conjunction with the visualization techniques, will make the data easy for anyone to understand.”</p>
<p class="p2">The goal of the data centers “is to bring together some of the historical data and the data that we will collect with the new equipment and become a go-to place for information about the bay,” Morgan said.</p>
<p class="p2">The state will also contribute an extra $3.8 million on top of the grant toward the initiative. A large part of these funds will be used to support workforce development programs, involving undergraduate students, graduate students, post-doctorates and young faculty in the process.</p>
<p class="p2">The funds will also support the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program, which is dedicated to giving undergraduate students an opportunity to participate in large-scale scientific projects while incorporating visualization techniques that highlight the potential benefits of artistic concepts in scientific research.</p>
<p class="p2">“One of the aims of SURF is to highlight the resources across the eight schools in the consortium that are available (for) visualization and imaging,” said Neal Overstrom, RISD’s Nature Lab director. “Programs like these are geared towards showing people what they can do, with hopes of them coming to use it for their own projects.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b></b><span class="s3">Many people are unaware that water exists on the moon, but University scientists have gone far beyond corroborating this fact: They created a quantitative map of it. In a recent study, researchers used technology called the Moon Mineralogy Mapper to analyze not only the location of water on the moon, but also the sources, amount and reason it’s there in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Ralph Milliken, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences and one of the authors of the study, the research conducted for this project builds on two previous papers: one published in 2008 that analyzed samples from the moon and found water within “glass beads” that formed during volcanic eruptions while the moon itself was taking shape, and one from 2009 that found evidence of water on the moon’s surface.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The next step was to map the moon. The team analyzed strips of data collected by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, which orbited the moon from 2008 to 2009, according to Shuai Li, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hawaii and one of the authors of the study. The researchers specifically looked at the signatures of reflected sunlight in the data. Different sorts of molecules reflect sunlight in different ways, which means that water can be distinguished from the rest of the lunar surface, Milliken said. The researchers analyzed the signatures at three microns; anything that was visible from that perspective had to be water, Li added. Afterward, they were able to combine all of the points to create their map.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Milliken and Li both differentiated between the two sources of water they analyzed on the moon. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One type of water comes from within the moon and exists inside “glass beads.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But solar wind bombardment is the primary source of water on the lunar surface, said Alice Stephant, a postdoctoral research associate at the Open University. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Water forms when solar winds cause protons ­— which are essentially hydrogen atoms — to bombard the surface of the moon, creating hydroxyl atoms, Milliken said. Data from current technology cannot differentiate between hydroxyl and water, so the samples on the moon could be just hydroxyl or a combination of water and hydroxyl, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The paper also focused on the volcanic deposits on the moon, indicating that some of the water must have come from inside the moon’s interior, said John Mustard, professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences and one of the authors of the 2009 study.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Li and Milliken’s map contained a number of key discoveries. Many researchers had assumed water only exists at the poles, but the map showed that it exists across the lunar surface and increases from the equator to the poles, Li said. It was previously thought that there is more water in the brighter regions of the moon than in the darker regions, but the study revealed that the distribution may be more or less the same. Regions around the glass deposits were also found to be very dry, while the deposits themselves are comparatively wet, Milliken said. Still, the moon is very dry. To collect around a liter and a half of water, one would have to process about 100 to 300 cubic feet of lunar soil, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yet the study shows that the moon is much wetter than scientists had previously thought, according to Mustard.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Milliken said that he would like to see more data, namely lunar samples, from future studies concerning water on the moon. These could answer some questions that are still unanswered, such as whether water exists on the moon along with hydroxyl. Some spacecraft that were not intended to examine the moon but looked anyway have suggested that there is indeed water on the moon. But from a physics perspective, water should be too unstable on the surface of the moon, which can heat up to over 100 degrees celsius. Further data could substantiate or invalidate claims that there is water along with hydroxyl on the moon, and answer questions of how it could exist there, Milliken added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Analyzing more samples could also provide insight into the distribution of water on the lunar surface, Mustard said. It is not fully known where water on the earth originated, and the collection of further samples could help answer this question, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The extent of water on the lunar surface is not completely known, said Bonnie Buratti, a planetary astronomer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. But it is a “hint of greater things.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New grant awarded for music therapy, dementia research</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A grant recently awarded to University researchers will allow them to investigate whether personalized music playlists can help patients suffering from dementia. The study, which will build on previous research conducted at the University, will eventually involve up to 60 nursing homes over the next five years and incorporates detailed data collection.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The project was originally inspired by “Alive Inside,” a documentary examining music therapy for patients with dementia, said Vincent Mor, principal investigator of the grant and professor of health services, policy and practice. His team got in touch with Dan Cohen, the creator of the show, and learned that the patients receiving music therapy were doing better on a variety of different measures. Lacking adequate systematic data on the program, the team decided to do a more in-depth study.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Researchers will first launch a pilot trial involving patients from four nursing homes to define exact forms of data collection and how to personalize the playlists, said Rosa Baier, associate director of Brown’s Center for Long-Term Care Quality and Innovation. Researchers will ask the patients themselves about their music tastes, reach out to family members and play music from earlier eras in order to create playlists personalized to each patient. A “trial and error sort of process” of playing different songs and watching patient reactions will also be tested, Baier added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Music can stimulate memories from a time that is hard-wired and this helps people cope with anxiety,” Mor said. Those with dementia often struggle with processing their constantly changing environment and listening to songs that bring back familiar memories from a younger age can provide relief.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study will then be expanded to the full trial, which will take three years and involve working with groups of nursing homes one after the other, Baier said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A number of different types of data will be collected, including interviews with patients, observations, comments from the nursing home staff and administrative data from the nursing homes. The iPods given to patients will also capture meta-data, showing which songs were played and when.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though research has been done previously on the correlation between music and dementia healing, this study’s rigorous data collection will provide more solid evidence than currently exists, Baier said. Her research center at Brown focuses on testing interventions that have promise but haven’t been proven. With the evidence provided by this study, “a non-pharmological approach could be disseminated more broadly to the population.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think it’s fantastic that this kind of scientifically rigorous research is being done on this topic,” said Aimee Baird of Macquarie University in Australia, whose work also focuses on the correlation between music and memory. “Anecdotal reports are not enough to convince people to fund these sorts of programs in age-care and medical facilities.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Workshop attracts researchers to examine waves, imaging in complex media</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics held a workshop on waves and imaging in random media last week, uniting scientists and mathematicians from different fields, institutions and backgrounds to present research on the many facets of the subject.</p>
<p class="p4">With so many practical applications, ranging from medical scanning to radar and seismology, the workshop’s focus is one of the “hottest topics in applied mathematics,” and the field has been expanding over the past 20 years, said Kui Ren, a coordinator and professor of mathematics at the University of Texas, Austin.</p>
<p class="p4">One well-known instance in which waves are used to penetrate “random media” is the common x-ray: Waves travel through tissue to allow a visual of what lies inside, Ren said.</p>
<p class="p4">Medical implications may offer the most direct and immediate effect on the public — “better resolution” fosters faster detection of birth defects, for example, suggested Chrysoula Tsogka, one of the coordinators of the workshop and professor of applied mathematics at Greece’s University of Crete and Stanford University. Other important applications include monitoring volcanoes, scanning the earth for oil and observing seismic activity.</p>
<p class="p4">“We would like to understand how complex media might affect our capabilities of imaging,” said Tsogka. Ren called this “one of the central issues in imaging,” due to the fact that<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“in general there is nowhere you are in a clean environment.”</p>
<p class="p4">Seeking this understanding meant bringing together a diverse cohort of experts. The workshop gathered about 60 mathematicians and researchers from across the globe and featured 20 speakers with varied research histories. “That’s the goal of this workshop: to make people from different fields meet, talk together and exchange ideas,” said Josselin Garnier, professor of applied mathematics at France’s Ecole Polytechnique and an organizer of the workshop.</p>
<p class="p4">Tsogka expressed the same sentiment, adding that “ideas that have worked in one application can be transferred to others. … It’s this interdisciplinary application that usually brings new insights for everybody.”</p>
<p class="p4">There was generative overlap between two speaker’s presentations, according to Tsogka — a method one had seen work in seismology, another had found to be similarly applicable to optics. “We might see a lot of imaging applications because of that,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">A key unifying factor amongst the workshop’s presentations and the differing fields represented is a single mathematical model, Garnier noted. “The values of the parameters, the scaling regime, what is small, what is large, depends on the application — but the basis is the wave equation,” he said. The wave equation is central to this research, though it is only part of a much larger mathematical picture. At the conference, people were discussing “almost anything you can think of in mathematics,” Ren said.</p>
<p class="p4">This workshop is part of ICERM’s semester-long program tackling “Mathematical and Computational Challenges in Radar and Seismic Reconstruction.” The workshop topic was the “perfect fit” for the broader program given its exploration of imaging methodologies that are crucial to these applications, Ren added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>BSE sends balloon into atmosphere</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brown Space Engineering launched a balloon into the upper atmosphere near Springfield, Mass. the morning of Sunday, Oct. 1 as part of a project meant to test new technology and demonstrate the accessibility of space. The balloon reached a height of nearly 100,000 feet and then flew south for two hours before landing in an 80-foot tree in Lebanon, Connecticut, according to Henry Belcaster ’19, the leader of the team behind the balloon project. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The balloon was equipped with a number of information-gathering apparatuses, said David Schurman ’20. The balloon itself was attached to a 3.5-kilogram payload, which has sections carved out to hold the technology. It contained a live analog camera that the team checked in real time, a GoPro and a 360-degree video camera.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the Earth’s surface, the balloon was 12 feet in diameter, Belcaster said. The latex balloon was filled with helium, which would cause it to rise. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The team carefully planned the launch: After between an hour and a half and two hours, the balloon would reach peak height with a diameter of about 35 feet. At this point, the pressure inside the balloon would exceed that of the atmosphere, and the balloon would burst. A parachute attached to the payload would then deploy, and the contraption would float back down to Earth. The team would track the balloon, which might end up 50 ­to 60 miles away, via a GPS locator.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is the second balloon launch of the project, Schurman said. At the beginning of last year, the research and development sector of Brown Space Engineering began to look toward the future of space technology and how it could be tested. The resulting idea was to launch a balloon to immensely high altitudes. They began planning that semester and started to assemble the balloon at the beginning of spring. The team launched the first balloon that April, but there were a number of problems. The electronics died before launch due to a bad battery and the assembly process was not organized enough, Schurman said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This second launch was executed “with great success,” Belcaster wrote in an email to The Herald. “Previous systems that failed in our spring launch lasted the entire flight,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Planning for the second launch began this summer, and the team strived to rectify the issues from the previous one, Schurman said. Development continued, culminating with the launch Oct. 1. Another launch is planned for the spring, Belcaster added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The balloon was supposed to collect many different sorts of information, said Asutosh Swain ’20, who worked on the project. Virtual reality would allow people to view the extended 360-degree footage, and there would also be a temperature and altitude reading. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are a number of organizations that use high-altitude balloons, Belcaster said. The federal government and various meteorological services take advantage of them, as they give a good reading of the atmosphere while being low-cost and quick to return data.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the main purposes of the launch was to test technology for future projects. Brown Space Engineering is currently working on a satellite called EQUiSat, which is a 10-centimeter “CubeSat.” Its LED lights will be visible from space, shining as brightly as the North Star, Swain said. It will be launched from the International Space Station in March, Schurman said. He also said that the purpose was to make a satellite that was not costly; indeed, the team is aiming to build the satellite for a total of $5,000.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another central focus of the launch is to dispel the perception of space as esoteric, Swain said. Many people have the notion that sending technology into space is an expensive and long endeavor, which is not the case, he added. Making space seem more accessible is one of the goals of the balloon project, emphasized by the fact that there were a number of freshman on the “balloon team,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sleep lab links alcoholism, mood to sleep</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everybody sleeps, yet we still know so little about why, what the brain does while we do or how it affects people’s behavior. Recent studies conducted bythe University’s joint sleep research lab with Bradley Hospital hope to answer some of these questions by identifying genes that control sleep and connecting sleep patterns to alcohol dependency and feelings of depression.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior Mary Carskadon started the lab for sleep research in 1985. She is “one of the pioneers of sleep education,” said Luis de Lecea, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University. Carskadon helped lead the College Sleep Study from 2010 to 2014, which surveyed incoming freshmen at the University about their sleep habits. Though the study ended with students from the class of 2018 due to a lack of <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2013/09/18/sleep-study-likely-end-due-lack-funding/">funding</a>,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Carskadon’s lab had used the data to correlate sleep habits with weight gain and night screentime.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Inspired by blood samples from participants collected in the same data set that hinted at a connection between certain genes and sleep, the Sleep Research Lab published results this year identifying five new genes in the C. Elegans worm that are connected to sleep. The researchers collaborated with the Department of Neuroscience, which helped run experiments on the worm, drawing off the sleep expertise of Carskadon’s lab. The study shines light on some of the mechanisms that control sleep in animals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Sleep Research Lab also published results this year alongside the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies that link sleep habits and psychiatric behavior to alcoholic tendencies. While alcoholism is caused by a complex set of factors, the group determined that sleep also comes into play. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most recently, the group has published results connecting certain sleep patterns to mood. While previous researchers have focused on this connection, Visiting Professor Tamar Shochat of the University of Haifa statistically showed that certain sleep behaviors correlated with patterns of depression. In the future, the group hopes to identify sleep patterns associated with types of alcoholism using similar analysis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lab’s recent studies illustrate the range of research enabled by the original data set. “It’s a very rich study, and it is technical from the molecular to the behavioral level,” Carskadon said. In addition to the alcoholism sleep classification study, the group hopes to further its partnership with the neuroscience department to identify more genes connected to sleep. Carskadon also proposed the possibility of restarting the incoming freshmen study to get richer, deeper data.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even with the lab’s progress, much remains unknown about sleep. But De Lecea is optimistic about the future. “The sleep field is an extremely active one, and recently it has become mainstream in neuroscience,” he said. “The questions are emerging more and more frequently.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Jim Gates theorizes on equality, skepticism in science</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">World-recognized theoretical physicist Sylvester Gates, better known as Jim Gates, started at Brown this year as the Ford Foundation Professor of Physics. Gates, who served on President Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, studies supersymmetry, supergravity and superstring theory. More recently, he started working in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>forensic science. In 1998, he became the first African-American to hold an endowed chair in physics at a major U.S. research university, the University of Maryland in College Park, and was also the first African American theoretical physicist to receive a National Medal of Science and be elected to the National Academy of Sciences.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Herald spoke with Gates about his work in forensic science and error-detecting codes, his role models and today’s skepticism surrounding science.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Herald: Could you explain your work in forensic science, and what drew you to that area?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gates: Most people who have watched TV for the last decade or so have seen programs like CSI, which portray forensic science as extraordinarily scientific and effective at solving crimes. The reality falls far short from what you see in Hollywood and the media. In fact, the 2009 study <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf">report</a>, “Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward,” pointed out that a large number of the forensic disciplines, which often have people testify in court, lack a strong scientific basis for showing that what they present as science is reliable. Since 2009, there’s been a slow evolution. As a scientist external to the discipline, I have no vested interest in the outcome, one way or another. Working with groups (such as the National Commission on Forensic <a href="https://www.nist.gov/topics/forensic-science/national-commission-forensic-science">Science</a> and the Organization of Scientific Area Committees for Forensic <a href="https://www.nist.gov/topics/forensic-science/organization-scientific-area-committees-osac">Science</a>), we are slowly putting in policies to move forensic science as a practice to be more based on actual scientific methods that can be reliable and useful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What kind of “more” scientific methods are you referring to?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let me use the example of bite marks. People have made claims that you can identify individuals from bite marks they have left on a body. The Obama PCAST, which I was part of, looked at reports of forensic science and pointed out that there is basically no scientific <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/09/07/white-house-report-concludes-that-bite-mark-analysis-is-junk-science/">evidence</a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that bite marks can lead to identification of a specific individual.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>What research do you hope to pursue going forward and why do you think it’s important?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A number of people are familiar with a TV production called “The Big Bang Theory,” which talks about string theory. Well, I am one of the people who actually works on this topic, and I have done so for all of my professional life. There are unresolved questions ­— in fact, string theory itself is incomplete as a scientific theory. For the last decade or so, I’ve been pursuing some unusual mathematical leads on how we can make it more complete. These leads have led to really strange results. One of the strangest that we have found is that many of the equations that we have about string theory are error-correcting codes. These are normally found in computer science, so why should the laws of nature involve this?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>It seems like a lot of your work has been interdisciplinary — why do you choose to work at the intersection of conventional fields?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is really only in this final push in my career that I have become more interdisciplinary. In my field (of theoretical physics), there is a problem that has not be solved in over 40 years. In the latter half of the ’90s, I decided that I wanted to go back and look at this problem and why it hadn’t been solved. Part of the reason the problem had not been solved is that everyone trying to solve it was using the same approach. I started developing some new ways of thinking about the problem (involving mathematics), and that’s what led to the discovery that certain equations have error-correcting codes in them. The old ways of thinking about it have failed, so I’m trying to at least make progress and move in an interdisciplinary direction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Are there people that you’ve found particularly inspiring in your career?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For a long time in my life, I did not understand the term “role model.” And then I realized that the reason I didn’t understand it was because I had so many (role models) that I had never thought of it! My personal role model was my father, who was an incredible man — not a scientist, but a soldier and veteran of World War II. A couple of outstanding ones from my youth were my geometry teacher, my high school physics teacher and my first physics teacher at the (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The list goes on and on, and today it includes an array of people far too many to name. One of the people that I have had as a real hero was Dr. John Holdren, who was Obama’s science advisor. I had many interactions with him over the course of eight years with the Obama administration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My hero maximus is Albert Einstein. Many people have heard about Albert Einstein — he was one of the most brilliant scientists. But many people do not know that in addition to science, he was just an incredible human being. In 2005, there was a celebration of his work because it was in 1905 that he produced the first set of his dazzling results. That year, I had to speak more than 40 times on five continents about Albert Einstein, so I basically bought a library so I could knowledgeably speak on him. I knew about his physics, but I learned about him as a person during that year. What I found most incredible was that Albert Einstein was one of the most forceful speakers against racism in the United States during the ’50s. He made forceful statements about the racism and the injustices that were inflicted upon African-Americans in this country. There’s a book called “Einstein on Race and <a href="https://onbeing.org/blog/albert-einsteins-essay-on-racial-bias-in-1946/">Racism</a>,” where anyone who wishes to learn about this aspect of his life can do so. He was also just someone who tried to help people in general, and this is something I didn’t understand about Albert Einstein until I had to speak on him.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>In physics and the science community in general, how do you think that the academic climate has changed for members of historically underrepresented groups?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The unfortunate truth is: not very much has changed. There’s a general idea that things have vastly improved, but recently there was a story in the New York <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/24/us/affirmative-action.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0">Times</a> that showed that the percentage of African-Americans in college has basically been the same for the last 30 years. People think that there has been rapid progress, but if you look at the numbers, that’s just not true. For my community, there has been very little change.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>How do you hope to see it change going forward?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">I’d like to see a society where fairness is more widely distributed and where outcomes are not dependent upon one’s economic or geographical origins.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>In your work communicating science to the public, what do you hope to leave people with? Are there any common conceptions you’d like to correct or influence?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are many misconceptions about science in the public. I’ve spoken on very specific things — for example, the detection of gravitational <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLLjetHuI2k">waves</a>. When I am called upon to speak to the public about specific scientific discoveries, I try to do so in a way so that it becomes understandable, and also in a way that it becomes understandable as part of a human activity. When someone writes a great novel or piece of music for the public, a lot of people get enthusiastic and understand that there’s a creative process at work there. It’s the same thing with science. It’s a very human endeavor, and it’s not something that only geniuses do, which is one of the biggest misconceptions. I try to communicate these things when I speak about science. It’s a large-scale activity that’s extraordinarily important for our species. We face changes like climate change, and the only thing that’s protecting us is our technology, and our technology comes straight from science.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>In this current era of fake news and distrust of science, how has your role as a researcher changed and how have you approached skepticism?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First off, skepticism is one of the bases of science, which most people don’t seem to understand. Scientists don’t just fall in love with our ideas. Science is one of the most argumentative things. Skepticism actually drives the development of science, because you’re always skeptical of your colleagues’ ideas. On the other hand, the kind of skepticism that we see playing out in the large social realm of our society right now is extraordinarily concerning. It kind of implies that everyone’s opinion is equal, and that’s just not true. People who are not informed do not have good opinions.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Beginning in the late 1970s, mindfulness moved from the ashram to the laboratory, where researchers began to study its effects on health. Brown has been at the forefront, having formally introduced a contemplative studies initiative and concentration over 10 years ago. Now, Brown is opening a new center for research and public facilitation of mindfulness practices that will work to “increase the quality of the evidence base and promote adoption of well-proven mindfulness practices,” according to a University press release.</p>
<p class="p2">The goal of the center is to convene researchers from various disciplines and assemble the data they have collected to “educate consumers on the impacts of mindfulness on mental and physical health,” said the Director of the Center Eric Loucks, associate professor of epidemiology at the School for Public Health.</p>
<p class="p2">“There is so much research on mindfulness happening across the country and in Rhode Island that if we can be more organized and connect with one another, we will be so much stronger,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Locally, the center is affiliated with Rhode Island Hospital and Miriam Hospital. The center will also collaborate with other institutions pursuing similar research across the globe, such as those at Oxford University, the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the Cambridge Health Alliance.</p>
<p class="p2">“Each (mindfulness) center has its niche. Ours is that we are housed within a larger center of epidemiology and mental health, so we have a strong emphasis on research and methods,” Loucks said.</p>
<p class="p2">The center also brings together many departments on campus. Housed in the School for Public Health, the center’s senior researchers come from a range of backgrounds including behavior and social sciences, psychiatry and human behavior, epidemiology and religious and contemplative studies.</p>
<p class="p2">“One of the purposes of the center is to develop mindfulness practices that are available to the larger community in the city and the state,” said Professor of Religious Studies and Director of the Contemplative Studies Initiative Harold Roth.</p>
<p class="p2">The center aims to make mindfulness-based intervention more accessible to the public through community outreach and education efforts. To further that goal, the Center for Mindfulness will work alongside the Swearer Center for Public Service, Roth said.</p>
<p class="p2">“We want to be able to implement intervention for people from all walks of life,” Loucks said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Funded by a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts, Gilad Barnea, associate professor of neuroscience, will partner with Ben Stanger, associate professor of medicine at Penn, in an attempt to utilize specialized methods for tracking substances between nerve cells to study how cancer cells move. The two scientists aim to develop an effective way to track the movement of cancer cells and ultimately discover how and when tumors spread.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The National Institutes of Health estimates that 90 percent of cancer deaths occur due to metastasis, or the spreading of cancer cells. But very little is known about the nature of their movement, as well as the reasons for why and where they move.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Metastasis is hard to study because it’s hard to see when the cell actually moves. It could happen at any point in time, which creates a black box scenario where we don’t really know what happens when a cell moves from its primary site to metastasis,” Stanger said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Barnea has devoted many years of his life to developing a method that tracks and labels neural circuits through the synapses. Both scientists saw that Barnea’s research, though focused on movement within the nervous system, could have potential applications in studying the nature of metastasis. “The method that (my team) developed, when stripped down from the specifics of the nervous system, could be a helpful tool in allowing us to study cancer,” Barnea said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Barnea and Stanger learned about each other’s scientific interests and pursuits through the annual meetings that the Pew Charitable Trusts organizes for the members of the Pew Scholars Program. Their current project is supported by the Pew Innovation Fund. This round of awards is the first of its kind and targets alums of other Pew awards and grants. Barnea and Stanger are both former awardees of the Pew Scholars Program in the biomedical sciences, which provides four years of funding to young outstanding assistant professors, supporting their independent research and jumpstarting their careers. During the four years, award recipients attend annual meetings as part of the program’s community-building initiative.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“These meetings bring together researchers that normally wouldn’t interact because of the many diverse research fields represented,” said Kara Coleman, project director of biomedical programs at the Pew Charitable Trusts. “Researchers are exposed to all different types of research, questions, perspectives and ideas from people outside their fields, which has led to many collaborations between individuals who find complementary ideas, even if they’re studying completely different things.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the goals of the Pew 2017 Innovation Grant was to encourage and reward interdisciplinary ideas that had potentially unique medical applications. “Ideally, we look for two individuals with distinct areas of expertise that don’t really overlap and with an idea that, when put together, can tackle a project no individual lab can do alone,” Coleman said. The grant also targets ideas that are not yet off the ground and which lack other sources of funding because there is not enough evidence to support their potential.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stanger mentioned that the theoretical application of Barnea’s research is simple: “We can use the same toolbox that was developed in Barnea’s research and get tumor cells to mark all the cells that they are in touch with as they metastasize.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">That could indicate how cancer cells move through the body, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it may be too early to project the success of this research, both scientists envision many applications. “Assuming that things go well, our research may allow us to intervene medically in the future, with possible therapeutic impact,” Barnea said. “Nevertheless, our research will hopefully deepen our understanding of different aspects of cancer and cancer movement.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Coleman said that Barnea and Stanger’s proposal exemplifies the raw interdisciplinary thinking that the Innovation Fund saw as a possibly impactful project. “This project is one of those things that, if it works, could be completely revolutionary, and that’s exactly the kind of thing that this program is trying to promote,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The grant’s purpose highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in science.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’ve seen first-hand how interdisciplinary science can be very valuable, specifically the applications of my postdoctoral work in development biology to my current work in cancer biology,” Stanger said. “While I’ve never done research that spans as great a distance as cancer biology and neuroscience, it is exciting and very cool to think about all the potential work that can be done.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The model that I developed in my own research stems from my own unique way of interdisciplinary thinking and expertise,” Barnea said. “The great part about interdisciplinary research is that if you combine two different (areas of) expertise, you are likely to create something that is unique to you.”</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">University researchers can now walk on the surface of the moon, analyze the footprints of a dinosaur and study molecular structure ­— all in the same place, thanks to the YURT, the new virtual reality theater at the Center for Computation and Visualization.</p>
<p class="p4">The YURT is one of CCV’s two virtual reality systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The second — the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment — is a cube-like structure that has seven projectors, two each on three of the sides and one on the bottom.</p>
<p class="p4">The YURT, built after the CAVE, was developed to be much larger and more advanced than its predecessor. “If seven projectors is cool, then 70 projectors would be 10 times as cool,” said Tom Sgouros, manager of the Virtual Reality Lab, in describing the thought process behind the YURT’s inception. The YURT is comprised of 145 mirrors that reflect transmissions from the 69 projectors that surround it. It uses 20 computers and 1.3 miles of video cable. The 2 million dollar-machine was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, Sgouros said.</p>
<p class="p4">To experience the virtual reality, the user dons a headpiece equipped with motion-capture technology and walks into the center of the YURT, which is enclosed by screens. Motion capture sensors inside read the placement of the user, which in turn allows the system to adjust the roughly 100 million-pixel projections on the screens to the user’s position.</p>
<p class="p4">This highly advanced virtual reality system opens up many new possibilities in the field of research, Sgouros said. For example, the YURT can project the surface of Mars. Where before scientists could look at contour maps to deductively discover where there were cliffs on the Martian surface, they can now use virtual reality to see it in a much more intuitive and accessible way, Sgouros said. Canyons that are believed to have been shaped by water can also be studied in this way, he noted. Using this virtual reality medium of analysis, the question “Is there water?” is replaced with “Where is the water?” according to Sgouros.</p>
<p class="p4">The work conducted by paleontologist Stephen Gatesy concerning analysis of dinosaur footprints also stands to benefit from this technology. The fluid-dynamic model of mud that the YURT can display will allow for a better view and therefore understanding of how dinosaurs walked, Sgouros said.</p>
<p class="p4">The YURT will also create a more intuitive presentation of exploratory data analysis in medicine, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">There are a number of students working on projects with researchers using the YURT, Sgouros noted. Active projects include a medical study and the creation of a program that allows users to build their own robots. Researchers are also taking advantage of the YURT’s unique ability to visualize phenomena ranging from star births and supernovas to four-dimensional objects.</p>
<p class="p4">Virtual reality can also help to make students more engaged with learning, said Adam Blumenthal, a virtual reality artist-in-residence who produces interactive media. Using the technology at the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts, he worked on a for-the-classroom recreation of the Gaspee Affair, a 17th century event in Narragansett Bay that is often considered the first act of war by colonists in the events leading to the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p class="p4">Virtual reality technology has advanced greatly since Blumenthal was first introduced to it in 1990. He experienced it initially as it was emerging from military labs at NASA and was “blown away by the potential.” It was too early at the time for virtual reality to be used outside of these developmental settings, so he had to wait while it “incubated” until it was usable in places such as the CCV.</p>
<p class="p4">The main benefit of these large-scale virtual reality systems as compared to headset systems — like the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift — is the collaboration they foster, said Sam Fulcomer, associate director of systems at the CCV. The success of CCV technology is central to the future of high-performance computing at the University, he said, adding that in the future, scientific visualization using virtual reality could receive unified and widespread support considering the abilities of display technology. It could also see wider use in laboratory settings, particularly due to the increased usage of head-mounting displays, Fulcomer added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>U. researchers gauge effectiveness of 3-D, 2-D mammograms</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">With the emergence of new technologies such as three-dimensional mammographies, many women and doctors are inclined to turn away from conventional two-dimensional mammographies and instead lean toward these more recently developed options. But a new study conducted by University researchers seeks to determine which type of breast cancer screening is actually more effective.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This study is a multi-center joint collaboration involving the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, the National Cancer Institute and Brown University’s Center for Statistical Sciences, said Constantine Gatsonis, professor of biostatistics and director of the Center for Statistical Sciences, who is leading the trial. The University’s center handles all of the statistical work, which includes design and data analysis throughout the trial.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This study, as big and expensive as it is, will really help guide patient care,” said Ilana Gareen, associate professor of epidemiology at the Center for Statistical Sciences. “It’s a head-to-head comparison of two competing interventions.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This trial could be crucial if it determines which of the two screenings is better, because the newer 3-D technology has currently not been completely accepted by all hospitals and insurances, Gareen said. The downsides of the new technology include a heavier price tag and more radiation. At the end of the day, researchers say it all comes down to which technology has better diagnostic rates.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s really important to do these head-to-head studies so that we get answers to questions of medical practice,” Gareen said. “Someone may develop a machine and truly believe it’s the best thing, but if you haven’t compared, then how do you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the main aims of the study is to simply find the quickest and most efficient pathway toward diagnosis, Gareen said. Doctors often do not have all of the information available to them to help make that important decision, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All breast imaging centers participating in the trial have both 3-D breast cancer screenings, known as tomosynthesis, and 2-D screenings, known as conventional, said Jean Cormack, biostatistician at the center. These sites throughout the United States will screen the women involved in the trial through a standard mammogram process, and the data analysis will then occur at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the data comes in, the statisticians look at “quality, completeness and mistakes — some of which databases are able to capture but others that we need to look at more closely,” Gatsonis said. In addition to the images that are collected and archived, University researchers will also analyze clinical data, biospecimen data and molecular data from biopsies and specimens given with consent. Much of this bulk analysis will occur three years into the trial, with researchers looking for specifics such as correlations with the imaging features or mutations in the genes.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The planet closest to the sun might have large areas of previously undiscovered ice on its surface. A new study by University researchers suggests that Mercury’s north pole is home to more ice than previously thought. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Using data collected from NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft, the team not only confirmed the presence of ice in craters already suspected to contain the substance, but also found new, smaller icy locations on the surface of the planet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prior to this analysis, seven craters on Mercury were thought to contain ice on the surface. New findings confirmed past evidence indicating the presence of ice for five such craters, but did not show evidence for surface ice in the remaining two,, said Ariel Deutsch ScM’17 GS, lead author of the study. The team also found evidence for ice in three more craters, totalling roughly 3,400 square kilometers in new icy surface area — slightly bigger than the area of Rhode Island. These bring the total number of large craters containing surface ice to eight.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even more surprising, Deutsch said, was the discovery of smaller-scale patches of ice. Four smaller deposits were found, together covering approximately 50 square kilometers — roughly the size of Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The planet closest to the sun might seem an unlikely place to find ice. But certain areas near the planet’s poles can remain cold enough to harbor it, according to Carolyn Ernst, planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. These exist in so-called “permanently shadowed areas,” where, due to Mercury’s lack of tilt, the surface of the planet receives no direct sunlight.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Evidence that water ice could exist in such permanently shadowed areas was first suggested by Earth-based radar long before MESSENGER was launched. With MESSENGER, more data was collected pointing to the conclusion that ice exists on the planet. Data recorded by the craft’s laser altimeter gave scientists information about Mercury’s surface, which they used to locate areas that were cold enough to sustain ice. In addition to giving researchers clues about cold areas about the topography of Mercury, the laser altimeter was also able to tell them what parts of the surface reflected in ways consistent with ice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The altimeter reported different values for terrains of different materials, Deutsch said. “Ice is very bright, and so, if you’re flying over that, it sticks out to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The team worked to interpret this reflectance data toward the north pole of the planet, finding new icy areas in both large craters and smaller patches, said Gregory Neumann ScM’91 PhD’93 P’20, NASA research scientist who co-authored the study along with Deutsch and Professor of Geological Sciences Jim Head PhD’69. They found that their newly interpreted data suggested that ice-like reflectance patterns coincided with areas on the surface predicted to be cold enough to sustain ice. “This confirmed what we had modeled geophysically, … but which we didn’t have the actual direct evidence of,” Neumann said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The results of the study raise new questions about how Mercury’s ice got there in the first place. “The fundamental question is: How did the ice get there, and when?” Neumann said, adding that scientists are leaning toward the theory that it was placed there by comets colliding with the planet. It is unclear why we don’t see such large areas of surface ice on our own moon, Neumann said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Ernst, the Moon contains permanently shadowed craters similar to Mercury’s and finding large areas of ice on the lunar surface could be of practical importance for future lunar missions. “It has implications for the Earth as well,” Ernst said, adding that studying ice on other bodies in our solar system could potentially provide clues about how Earth got its oceans and came to sustain life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the study, different pieces of evidence came together and led to the same conclusion, Ernst said. “That’s what you really want, is to look at something several different ways and come up with the same answer.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The researchers anticipate that the BepiColumbo spacecraft, set to launch for Mercury in October of next year, will provide an even better look at more of Mercury’s surface, answering still unresolved questions about the enigmatic planet.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tymoczko discusses connection between math, music</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Dmitri Tymoczko, professor of music at Princeton, analyzed the connection between math and music Tuesday in a lecture titled “Musical Geometry, Games and Multimedia Art” as part of the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics’ public lecture series. Tymoczko is a musician by training, but his work involves many high-level mathematical concepts, drawing parallels between complex mathematical structures and Western music pieces.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tymoczko’s work is only the latest development in a long history of exploration at the intersection of math and music. In Ancient Greece, Pythagoras drew connections between certain ratios and harmonies, and, in renaissance Italy, Vincenzo Galilei — the father of Galileo — found relationships between math and music as well, Tymoczko said in an interview with The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brendan Hassett, director of ICERM, introduced Tymoczko and praised his work, pointing out that he is the only musician published in the research publication Science. In his lecture, Tymoczko analyzed various classical pieces of music using higher dimensional objects, such as Frederic Chopin’s “Prelude in E-Minor” and several pieces from Dmitri Shostakovich. He found that several classical pieces are very closely related to tesseracts, a type of four-dimensional object. Tymoczko has recently expanded his work to encompass rock music as well, observing that many rock songs abide by a mathematical model, albeit a different one than classical music follows. Tymoczko said that his findings refute the idea that modern rock musicians are not properly trained, a notion often put forth by classical musicians.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though a non-mathematician may have a difficult time understanding Tymoczko’s work, he has created a number of visual animations and programs to illustrate his ideas, including a program that rethinks the way notes are arranged and an animation of a song’s chords highlighted on a mathematical object. One of his pieces is currently on display at the Museum of Mathematics in New York, helping everyday viewers draw parallels between math and music.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While music is obviously closely connected to mathematics, there is a limit to which theories can be applied, Tymoczko told The Herald. Not all branches of math are connected to music, and Tymoczko thinks it is unlikely that new areas of math will reveal a connection either. “Math done at universities today is much more complicated than anything you will ever need in music,” Tymoczko said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tymoczko originally separated his music from his research, hesitating to make pieces based off a mathematical concept. “A lot of composers got lost in theoretical ideas that weren’t that helpful. I wanted my music to be beautiful,” Tymoczko said. But, in recent years, he has composed a piece titled “The Thousand Faces of Form,” which implements various complex geometrical theories, seeking to strike a balance between math and music. The piece is accompanied by a visual component created by Nathan Selikoff, which depicts the geometry in action.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tymoczko’s lecture was interesting to both the mathematicians and non-mathematicians in the audience alike. Many mathematically-oriented attendees questioned and praised the mathematical side of Tymoczko’s work during the question-and-answer session, while non-mathematicians inquired about the general applicability of his work beyond mathematics. Maddy Adams ’21 said she greatly enjoyed the lecture, particularly Tymoczko’s visualizations of chord progressions. Math and music are seemingly different on the surface, but Tymoczko’s lecture showed the deep intersection between the two, she said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The salt marshes of New England are disappearing. There is not one singular cause to which blame can be directed, however. As a recent paper has shown, it is the synergistic relationship between two factors — the dearth of purple marsh crab predators and the rising sea level resulting from climate change — that is responsible for this loss of salt marsh.</p>
<p class="p4">The crabs in question are sesarma reticulatum, or the purple marsh crab, which is an invasive species of crab that has lived in the salt marshes of New England for decades. Mark Bertness, co-lead author of the paper and professor of biology, describes them as “hippie crabs” due to the communal system of tunnels in which they live and breed. They feast upon the vegetation in the salt marshes — the various roots, rhizomes and so forth — but are usually kept in balance by the predators, namely the different types of fish that live in that area. But as the number of these predators declines due to human interaction, these crabs have been able to expand their numbers exponentially. According to the paper, the combination of the crabs’ ability to proliferate due to the low predatation and rising sea levels combine to affect the salt marshes more than if either factor acted alone.</p>
<p class="p4">To test this, the researchers went to the marshes of Colt State Park in Bristol, Bertness said. They dug up parts of the marsh and completely submerged them to mimic drowning. They did this in the winter so that the plants were not affected. Returning after winter, the researchers set the samples of marsh at different heights to simulate the effects of climate change-induced sea level rise. They also dug up hard peat from the same area for comparison.</p>
<p class="p4">Marsh at the high water level, through which the crabs did not traditionally tunnel due to the normally hard peat, all of the vegetation was eaten by the crabs, Bertness said, showing the effects of climate change combined with the effects of the salt marsh crabs spreading. When salt marsh peat is softened, crabs are likely to extend further and have a greater impact, said Sinéad Crotty ’15, another co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student at the University of Florida. Taking into account only climate change, eight percent of salt marshes will be lost; but considering this synergistic interaction of the two stressors, 86 percent will be lost, Bertness said.</p>
<p class="p4">Experiments in the last decade spurred the researchers to investigate the crabs’ effects. To see how the crabs fare in areas of low predation, they attached the crabs to fishing lines and left them in areas that have and have not experienced large human impact. In the areas of low human impact, they found that almost all the crabs were eaten in one night; but this was not the case in areas of high human impact, Bertness said. After three months, these crabs were still thriving.</p>
<p class="p4">Another past experiment involved total predator removal, where Bertness and other researchers cut off predators’ access to the crabs. While he had initially assumed that the experiment would have taken a couple of summers, after only one, there was a 50 percent reduction in the amount of biomass in the marshes.</p>
<p class="p4">In the latest experiment, Crotty was surprised by how quickly the proliferation of the crabs occurred. In the area studied, the crabs were grazing at the furthest points that they were known to graze within the first month. This suggests that the crabs are actively venturing from their burrows and looking for new areas to inhabit, and that as soon as these new areas were ready, they would, Crotty said.</p>
<p class="p4">Christine Angelini, another co-lead author of the paper and an assistant professor at the University of Florida, found the extent of the crabs’ impact to be surprising. Whereas she had initially assumed the area to which the crabs would tunnel would be more concentrated, she found in the study that the crabs could travel long distances to seek out new habitats. While the marshes had initially been slowly softened and eroded from the outside, they were now being eroded in softened patches throughout the marsh, leading them to have what Angelini described as a “swiss cheese” appearance. She had not expected the crabs to migrate in such an aggressive manner.</p>
<p class="p4">More synergistic studies such as this one are needed to study different parts of ecology, including the connection between predation and crab spread, said Jon Witman, professor of biology. He suggested more studies monitoring the rates of fish predation on the crabs in order to pinpoint which species in particular is responsible.</p>
<p class="p4">Efforts to figure out means to control the spread of the crabs other than the top predators is important in helping to mitigate the damage done by these crabs, Witman said. Moves to increase the local predator populations in these areas and reduction of fishing pressures are important in this regard, Angelini said.</p>
<p class="p4">People do not adequately appreciate what these marshes do in terms of ecosystem services, Bertness said. These include cleaning the water column and buffering the shoreline from storms. “If you monetize what shorelines do for us, mangroves and salt marshes are, in terms of ecosystem services, the most valuable systems on the planet on a hectare-by-hectare basis,” Bertness said. According to his calculations, there will be a $161 million a year loss in ecosystem services by 2050.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Modification of CLOCK gene to offer potential epilepsy treatment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A study recently revealed that seizures in epileptic patients correlate with the lack of the “CLOCK” gene, which typically regulates circadian rhythm. This new finding could give rise to a potential treatment for severe cases of epilepsy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There are currently medications that treat epilepsy, but disruptive and dangerous seizures can still occur while patients are on these medications, said Judy Liu, assistant professor of neurology and corresponding author of the study. As a last resort, the part of the brain that causes seizures can be surgically removed, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s a hard conversation to have with a patient when the epilepsy is so bad that the only thing you can do about it is take a part of the brain out,” Liu said. She realized, though, that the brain tissue in this removed part could actually be studied.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The seizure-generating part of the brain that had been removed in consent-giving patients was mapped out onto grids in as small an area as possible. The research team then searched for anything unusual, and they found the CLOCK gene had a strong effect on abnormalities.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We got lucky. It turns out that, because CLOCK is a circadian rhythm gene, it cycles, but all of our surgeries for epilepsy are done at 8 a.m. on Friday mornings,” Liu said. “People have asked me why no one else has discovered this, and it’s probably because our surgeons are on time,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Because the researchers were unsure which type of neurons the effect was occurring in, they decided to model the seizures in mice, said Peijun Li, co-lead author and post doctoral fellow at the Children’s National Health System. They found that, without the CLOCK gene in firing neurons, the mice had a high risk of seizures.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Likewise, the seizures in mice without the CLOCK gene occurred spontaneously during their sleep, Liu said. When they went back and looked at patients, it seemed like a lot of them were having these problems during sleep as well.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Daniel Friedman ’97, associate professor of neurology at NYU Langone Medical Center, said the findings were interesting “because we know that for some people, seizures tend to occur at certain times of the day.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The concept of a CLOCK-related treatment, though it would require further research, holds potential for patients suffering from severe cases of epilepsy. Because the CLOCK gene occurs in the brain and throughout the body, where it regulates metabolic state, it would be necessary to deliver a CLOCK modifier directly to the brain circuit with, for example, some sort of surgical implantation, Liu said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Certain strategies may include seeing if there are mechanisms to regulate the transcription factor (for CLOCK), using gene editing technology or even developing models that can turn (the gene) on,” Friedman said. More research and understanding is likely required to figure out how to do that effectively without influencing other things related to the CLOCK gene.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Four faculty members have been awarded Director’s Fellowships by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA. Director’s Fellowships are given to the most exceptional performers of DARPA’s Young Faculty Award recipients.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">DARPA’s Young Faculty Award aims to consistently establish and sustain groups of young scientists motivated to pursue high-risk, high-reward research by pairing selected researchers with DARPA program managers and providing them with up to $500,000 in funding for a two-year period.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Assistant Professor of Engineering David Borton, Assistant Professor of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology Amanda Jamieson, Assistant Professor of Computer Science George Konidaris and Assistant Professor of Computer Science Stefanie Tellex won Young Faculty Awards in 2015, four of 24 awardees. The Director’s Fellowship will provide them with another year of funding of up to $500,000.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Borton’s lab focuses on neural engineering techniques that aim to develop prosthetic limbs that provide sensory feedback to the nervous system, something that no prosthetic limb can do yet. Currently, users can only somewhat manipulate their prosthetic limbs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The only feedback that people get from their prosthetic legs is from the stump, which is where the end of the body meets the start of the prosthetic limb,” Borton said. “Learning about how nerves … recognize where the limb is and what the limb is doing … is especially important for people with lower limb loss because when you have a prosthetic leg, you don’t know where it is in space, and you have a tendency to fall more often.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the two years of research funded by the Young Faculty Award, Borton’s lab has successfully developed computational models necessary to recreate sensory feedback from the limbs as well as a system that can transfer this information to the spinal cord through electrical stimulation. With the extra year of funding, Borton hopes to divert his attention from the spinal cord to the brain.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There are so many people, through no fault of their own, that are in the situation where there is a leg and arm missing, and they deserve the best technology that can help them regain senses,” Borton said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With the funding from the Young Faculty Award, Jamieson’s lab explored the lung’s microbiome and how host organisms, bacterial infections and flu infections interact with different lung diseases. For the Director’s Fellowship, Jamieson has proposed to examine how lung infections affect healing in the skin and develop therapies to increase the healing process in the presence of pneumonia and other lung diseases.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The researches found a drastic suppression in the body’s healing response to the wounds, Jamieson said. “While we expected that responses would decrease because the immune system would be responding to two issues, it was surprising how drastic the decrease was.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When people experience slower skin wound healing, it “increases chances of infection and lengthens hospital stays,” Jamieson said. Responding differently when treating skin wounds for people with pneumonia could potentially decrease these issues, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“From a health perspective, understanding how the lung immune system happens and how we can respond to different infections and wounds at the same time is essential,” Jamieson said. “Wound healing is a huge area in terms of its impact on human health, but is very underfunded. … It is something that needs to be studied more.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a researcher in artificial intelligence, Konidaris explained that many AI researchers are currently failing to intelligently process both low-level tasks, like picking up and identifying objects, and high-level tasks, such as playing chess. His work focuses on building a specific way to connect these low-level tasks to high-level tasks by inventing abstract symbolic representations, allowing the robot to create accurate plans far into the future.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In his third year of research under DARPA funding, Konidaris hopes to generalize beyond one specific situation for robots and apply this method to any type of situation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I want to solve the questions that are most central to creating AI, and, at the moment, the most central question is, ‘How we can go beyond pixels and motors on robots?’ The reason why I focus on abstractions is because it’s so glaringly necessary (for robots) to be able to do intelligent decision making.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tellex’s lab specializes in human-robot interaction, discovering ways to create robots that work collaboratively with people, according to a University press release. With her funding from the Young Faculty Award, Tellex has been working on algorithms that allow robots to combine signals translated from human speech and gestures. This allows robots to execute simple fetching tasks with more speed and accuracy. With the Director’s Fellowship, Tellex will continue working on her algorithm, hoping to expand its scope, according to the press release.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Scientists explain water on ancient Mars</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Though scientists have long observed signs of water on ancient Mars, they could not explain how it came to exist in the frigid climate of those times. But in a paper published in “Icarus,” scientists have recently developed a model of ancient Mars that reconciles this conflict and explains the effects of seasonal temperature variation on the climate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There are a number of examples of evidence that indicate the presence of water on early Mars, such as lakes and valley networks, said Ashley Palumbo GS, co-lead author of the paper. There are also phyllosilicates — clay substances in the Martian surface — that required water to form, said Robin Wordsworth, assistant professor of environmental science and engineering at Harvard and co-lead author of the paper. Despite this, there had not been a consensus as to how liquid water could have survived in the extremely cold environment. The general acceptance among scientists was that the temperature nearly four billion years ago, when the water would have existed, must have been warm enough to cause rainfall and surface runoff, Palumbo said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For their research, Palumbo and Wordsworth, along with Jim Head, professor of geological sciences and co-lead author of the paper, developed a model of Mars to test for the climate where water could exist while remaining within the constraints of known ancient Martian climate knowledge, Wordsworth said. They used the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique global climate model, Palumbo said. Incorporating atmospheric and surface physics, the model was able to accurately recreate climate dynamics and generate a plot of where the valley networks occur. They also used long-term ecological data from Antarctica, which has flowing water despite its frigid terrain. This model offered the team a window into the Mars of 3.8 billion years ago — when life was just forming on Earth — to see water on a completely different planet, Wordsworth said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team found that average annual temperatures could have been far below the freezing point of water, and liquid water still could have persisted in the warmest hours of the summer season, Palumbo said. Seasonal changes could have caused the temperature to briefly increase enough to cause melting of surface ice, and the resulting water could accumulate to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>create the different geological features. This explanation reconciles the previous conflicts of water existing in the frozen climate without any sort of external force, such as volcanic eruptions or impact cratering, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This “excellent bit of modelling” allowed the team to show there were temporal climates on an annual basis on Mars, said John Mustard, professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Scientists do not have definitive knowledge of Martian temperatures from the past, Wordsworth said. What they do know, however, is constraints on the luminosity of the sun and on carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere going back in time. Using these two constraints, as well as a few other factors, scientists defined a range of possible surface temperatures and subsequently found which state of climate is the most plausible to allow for the melting of ice on Mars.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Creating a model that allows for the formation of water despite the coldness of the surface has been a longstanding c</span>hallenge, Mustard said. Prior to the study, no model had been able to recreate the continuous warm and wet climate of Mars that would explain the continuous presence of liquid water; models could only recreate the icy climate, Palumbo said.</p>
<p class="p4">This led the team to test if seasonal variations would be sufficient to cause the necessary warmth. Mars is currently very cold, with temperatures far below the freezing point of water, because it has a very thin atmosphere, Palumbo said. Mars lost its atmosphere through time, though scientists are not exactly sure how much; however, there are currently projects in operation, such as the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, that are attempting to discover the atmospheric loss throughout time. By constraining the thickness of the atmosphere further, climate models can better describe the early climate.</p>
<p class="p4">By using Earth as a Mars analog, this research can help scientists expand their knowledge of Earth, Palumbo said. Since Antarctica and early Mars appear to be climactically similar, the positing of such temperature variation in frigid Martian climates could serve to help uncover more facts regarding implications of temperature variation in the coldest part of Earth. Liquid water activity still takes place in the Antarctic and some basic forms of life persist there, which has implications for possible life on Mars, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">Wordsworth said this project has potential for studies off of Mars in that it could help explain early developmental processes in the solar system. It may also assist in work regarding the habitability<span class="s3"> and observation of planets further from the sun than Earth, such as exoplanets.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">During the weeks Professor of Physics Brad Marston was hiking the Pacific Crest Trail last year, he had ample time to contemplate the deflection of waves at the earth’s equator and the ways magnetic fields influence charged particles. “They both have a force that acts at right angles to the motions and makes circular trajectories,” he said. “I just had a feeling that there was a closer connection.”</p>
<p class="p4">Rec<span class="s3">ent research by Marston and collaborators draws a novel parallel between physics and climate science: Waves in water and air propagating along the equator closely mimic the behavior of topological insulators — materials that allow electrons to flow along their surfaces but not within their interiors. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of his collaborators in Lyon, France had observed similar patterns in the atmosphere, Marston said. These<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“ribbons of current” resembled the movement of electrons along the edges of topological insulators, he added. “The mathematics is basically the same.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some of these waves can be observed by tracking temperature changes as they migrate over the planet, said Antoine Venaille, physics researcher at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon. El Niño, a pulse of warm water that moves periodically in the Pacific, illustrates this kind of progression. “It looks like the temperature anomaly cannot go into the North or into the South — it is really trapped,” Venaille added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The waves the team examined act as a vital element of atmospheric dynamics in equatorial regions, Venaille said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But “they were always kind of mysterious,” Marston said. Even this analysis uses simpler physics equations than Venaille originally had in mind. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The model we use is extremely feeble,” said Pierre Delplace, another physics researcher at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon. More realistic models could add complexity to better represent the reality of the movement, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But there are other directions this research could take since this kind of wave movement is not confined to equatorial movements of water and air. These flowing patterns occur in many kinds of systems, according to M. Cristina Marchetti, associate director of the Syracuse Biomaterials Institute. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After hearing about this application of condensed matter physics to climate science, Marchetti began using the same type of equations to model movements of strikingly different scales in the biological realm, from bacteria moving along the curved surfaces of internal organs to the flocking of birds and fish. “There are similar phenomena that occur in large crowds,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Similar wave patterns may even be present on other planets or bodies in space, Venaille said. “There remains some mystery to be explained.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking toward a future of climate change, such modeling could shed light on ways the earth will continue to develop. “A lot of attention is paid to how much the average temperature of the earth is going to increase, but what we really need to know is how regional climates are going to change,” Marston said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Physics is well poised to inform climate science — the most interdisciplinary of the sciences, according to Marston. Numerous disciplines are woven into the complexity of the environment, ranging from geology and chemistry to math and physics. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I like the interplay of the richness and chaos and order and disorder,” Marston said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EPA pulls speakers from conference</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">At a conference in Providence Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled talks by three scientists whose work provides evidence for the harmful effects of climate change on the Narragansett Bay.</p>
<p class="p4">Although the EPA helped to fund the report that the conference focused on, the agency initially offered no explanation for why it barred panelists Rose Martin and Emily Shumenchia and keynote speaker Autumn Oczkowski from presenting. The decision left the organizers of the workshop scrambling for new speakers.</p>
<p class="p4">The cancellation comes under an EPA that has been hesitant to address climate change. EPA chief Scott Pruitt has gone on record saying that he does not believe that human emissions are the primary driver of global temperature changes, and many environmental researchers have expressed worries that the agency will cut funding to climate research. Additionally, the agency has removed resources for fighting climate change from its website, affecting local governments’ ability to address the issue.</p>
<p class="p4">Many scientists swiftly denounced the EPA’s decision following coverage from the New York Times and the Washington Post, criticizing the agency online and in a protest in Providence, which was attended by over 40 citizens and scientists. Responding to public outcry, the EPA explained its decision as an internal “miscommunication.”</p>
<p class="p4">Attendees of the workshop are hesitant to accept that answer. “It wasn’t bad communication; it was an example of the way they would like to handle things at the upper echelons of the EPA,” said John King, professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island and chair of the Science Advisory Committee of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program.</p>
<p class="p4">Tom Borden, program director of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, said he was “disappointed” by the decision, adding that he had yet to receive a clear explanation.</p>
<p class="p4">The workshop, which was held Monday despite the cancellations, presented the results of a report on the Narragansett Bay and its watershed. The report found that joint cleanup efforts between the government, businesses and scientists have increased the environmental quality of the bay. But it also concluded that climate change could undo all of the recent gains in coming years, King said.</p>
<p class="p4">“As environmentalists, we need to plan for the worst case scenario,” King said. He stressed that scientists can only do so by addressing human-induced climate change with that.</p>
<p class="p4">The EPA’s move also elicited criticism from some Democratic Congressmen.</p>
<p class="p4">“Muzzling scientists benefits no one,” wrote Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), w<span class="s3">ho also spoke at the conference, in a tweet on Monday. “Science gives us headlights to see what’s coming up for us in estuaries like Narragansett Bay in RI.”</span></p>
https://twitter.com/SenWhitehouse/status/922499129582014464
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite the agency’s recent hesitancy to address climate change, numerous scientific reports — including the one on Narragansett Bay — have documented widespread evidence of it, pointing to rising sea levels, global temperatures, water quality and air quality. The scientific community has virtually unanimously stood behind these reports, continuing to push their results in the face of public skepticism.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Paradoxically, the agency continues to fund a number of environmental studies across the country, including 26 watershed projects similar to the one conducted on the Narragansett Bay, King said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The conference’s keynote speaker was replaced by Robinson Fulweiler, associate professor of biology, earth and environment at Boston University, according to the workshop’s website. Fulweiler, who studies how climate change impacts marine life, called the move an “abuse of power” b</span>y the Trump administration, the Washington Post reported.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Gerrymandering — the redrawing of voting districts for political gain — has been a problem in the United States for over two centuries. However, with the Supreme Court’s hearing on Gill v. Whitford concerning a controversial redistricting plan in Wisconsin, the issue has once again emerged as a pertinent topic for national debate. One University professor believes that solutions to the problem can be found using computer algorithms.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’ve been thinking for years, really, about the problem of redistricting,” said Philip Klein, professor of computer science. Klein recently co-authored a paper describing a method for dividing states into equally-populated districts using so-called “balanced centroidal power diagrams.”</p>
<p class="p2">Klein co-authored the paper along with Neal Young, professor of computer science at the University of California at Riverside, and Vincent Cohen-Addad, a post-doc<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in computer science at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="p2">Klein and Cohen-Addad worked together on many of the principles that they later implemented in the paper. Cohen-Addad said he and Klein saw the potential for adapting their work for the purpose of dividing states into equal partitions, which led them to devise their redistricting algorithm.</p>
<p class="p2">The algorithm Klein and his team offered first finds a center point for each proposed district, then tries to minimize the distance of people in the state to each of these centers, all while maintaining balance between the populations assigned to each center point, Klein said. By completing this process, the algorithm can give relatively simple district shapes, each containing a similar number of people.</p>
<p class="p2">“One of the advantages of this method is it provides very little scope for politicians to engineer it,” Klein said.</p>
<p class="p2">Klein’s vision for the future of political redistricting involves using data and computer models to draw boundaries. He admits, however, that there are various requirements — among them those set forth by the Voting Rights Act — which are difficult to account for in an algorithm.</p>
<p class="p2">This is an important qualification, according to Moon Duchin, mathematician at Tufts University and orchestrator of the Tufts’ Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group. She points out that in addition to the racial and ethnic complexities of the Voting Rights Act, the computational approach in question does not account for laws aimed at preserving county, city and town borders or what locales referred to in the law as “communities of interest.”</p>
<p class="p2">Such legal requirements make the process of drawing district boundaries much more complicated, said Justin Solomon, assistant professor at MIT and a member of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group. Solomon points to the example of communities of interest: “This is one of these phrases that, unfortunately, is difficult for mathematicians to work with.” According to Solomon, a “community of interest” could be anything from a minority group to people who own waterfront property in Florida, making it hard to represent mathematically.</p>
<p class="p2">“Redistricting is a famous example of what we call an NP-hard problem in the computational world,” Solomon said, noting that it’s unreasonable to expect software to produce a single, ideal districting plan given the current list of criteria. But he doesn’t discount the idea of using computer models as part of the procedure. “Coming up with a fair redistricting process probably is a sort of a partnership between humans, machines and mathematical modeling.”</p>
<p class="p2">While math can generate many possibilities for districting plans,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Duchin stressed that the shaping of political districts will always be a human process. The idea that drawing boundaries could ever be left entirely up to computers is dubious, Duchin said. But there could be value in enumerating possible districting schemes, using models like Klein’s, so that legal qualifications could be examined, she added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ivy League Undergraduate Research Symposium to meet in November</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The inaugural Ivy League Undergraduate Research Symposium will take place at Penn Nov. 10 to Nov. 12, bringing together roughly 200 undergraduate students from across the eight Ivy League schools.</p>
<p class="p2">The creation of ILURS was largely the vision of Anuj Amin, executive director of the symposium. “One of the things in my Penn experience that I wasn’t able to do was connect with other majors,” Amin said. He said he found the difficulty he had networking with scholars at the undergraduate level to be difficult.</p>
<p class="p2">After speaking with the Director of Undergraduate Research and Fellowship at Penn, Amin was inspired to create a platform that would connect the academics occurring at each of the Ivies, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">“There are definitely sports circuits and different, other more specific types of conferences” which bring the Ivy League together, Amin said. But he was unaware of a single interdisciplinary platform that connects the schools, he added. With this in mind, “one thing led to another and ILURS was born,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Amin outlined two main goals for the symposium: to promote undergraduate research, giving undergraduates the opportunity to present their work and speak with other researchers, and to foster networks between scholars from multiple academic backgrounds.</p>
<p class="p2">“What sets (ILURS) apart (from other research conferences) is that we are not solely focused on the research aspect,” said Pranay Vissa, director of internal affairs for ILURS. “Research is obviously the most important part of the symposium, but we are really keen on trying to build interdisciplinary relationships and networks between people,” he explained.</p>
<p class="p2">To facilitate both its goals, the symposium will also feature keynote speeches and hold career fairs, crash courses and workshops for the attendees.</p>
<p class="p2">Twenty-one students from Brown will journey to Penn this November to attend the symposium. Alexander Adia ’18 will be attending the conference and said that he is looking at ILURS as an opportunity to present his first original research project. “The reason you present research, in general, is to make people think about the questions you are asking and the problem that you are investigating,” Adia said. Through the conference, he hopes to learn how to improve his research presentation in order to make his work salient to other people.</p>
<p class="p2">Allen Green ’21 will also be a conference attendee and believes ILURS will offer several opportunities for him. “There’s a lot of networking there,” he said. “So I’m pretty excited for that.” Green also expressed that the workshops at the conference would help him prepare for higher level research.</p>
<p class="p2">ILURS’s efforts to promote undergraduate research will continue even after the conference. Following the symposium,“we will be working to establish a journal called the ‘Ivy League Undergraduate Journal of Research,’” Amin said. The journal, which will be divided into academic disciplines in accordance with the symposium, will function as “another platform for academic discussion,” he explained.</p>
<p class="p2">Another post-conference initiative is the establishment of the Ivy League Research Fund. “Financial obligations should not be a hindrance to knowledge,” Amin said.</p>
<p class="p2">Both Amin and Vissa anticipate that ILURS will become an annual event. “We were actually blown away by the number of abstracts that were submitted,” Vissa said. “We have a lot of support on campus,” he said. “And in terms of organizational strength, we are definitely poised to make this an annual thing.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">With a focus on demographic disparities in STEM fields, several University faculty members and students spent Oct. 19 to 21 at the 2017 Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science conference in Salt Lake City. They joined a community of around 3,000 scholars, tied together by a passion for science and empowering minorities, to listen to keynote speakers, conduct and attend workshops and discuss ongoing research projects.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Students are really able to get inspired since it not only provides the opportunity for students to be able to listen to their peers from institutions across America, but also gives them the opportunity to interact with experimenters in their field and, of course, in other fields,” said Associate Dean of the College for Undergraduate Research and Inclusive Science Oludurotimi Adetunji.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Johnny Guzman, associate professor of mathematics, has been attending SACNAS since he was a graduate student. This year, his workshop explored differential operators, a relatively new and popular field in mathematics, through an undergraduate lens.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In addition, Assistant Professor of Mathematics Tarik Aougab hosted a second Modern Math Workshop on hyperbolic geometry for around 35 undergraduate students. He will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates in this subject area at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics and decided to present a mini-course on this topic to a broader audience at SACNAS this year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Throughout these workshops and the rest of the conference, Guzman encouraged student attendees to look into Brown’s graduate program. Aougab highlighted how the conference was the ideal space for the math department to increase its accessibility to minority and underrepresented students.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“One of the primary things I do is to build networks with people and serve as a mentor to students. I like to attend the poster session, where I can meet lots of students, see what research they have done, give them feedback and encourage them to look into our graduate programs,” Guzman said. “I also network with my peers — we offer ourselves support and community and help each other out.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With the ability for the organization to aid the recruitment and retention of underrepresented students,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>SACNAS’ Brown chapter was started in 2012 by Adetunji and Professor of Biology Mark Johnson, the club’s current advisors. In 2013, this chapter was recognized by SACNAS as a “Role Model Chapter,” which attests to its efforts to host speakers and mock workshops where students practice presenting their projects among peers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“At Brown’s SACNAS chapter, we cultivate this environment that fosters a sense of community whereby students are able to have opportunities to be mentored or serve as mentors to other students,” Adetunji said. “If they are applying to a position, a person who has gone through the process before can help them.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The larger issue of diversity in STEM is brought alive through the vivid stories of struggles and challenges that were overcome, narrated by keynote speakers at the SACNAS conference. This year, keynote speaker Dr. Tyrone B. Hayes, discussed how his interest in frogs carried him through challenges and allowed him to persevere, leading him to become a renowned biologist.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There is what is unfortunately a very normative mode of interaction that is taken for granted as being the way that mentorship or advising should be,” Aougab said. “It is — not coincidentally — a mode of interaction that certain types of students are more comfortable with than others. ... (Attempting to) subvert that is a very difficult problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Despite the advances the University has made through its Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, Aougab feels that it will take time and deeper conversations about racism to improve diversity in the sciences.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I feel that many times, diversity is a buzz word that gets thrown around that signals you’re having the right conversation, but it can often be just surface deep,” Aougab said. “I don’t feel that you are really thinking about the full aspect of why diversity is important if you are not thinking about the ways in which your discipline affects your world outside of Brown.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New Lego set celebrates women in NASA</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>Updated Nov. 1, 3:47 p.m.</strong></em>
<p class="p3">Today, young girls who dream of becoming astronauts or space scientists will be able to literally hold their futures in the palms of their hands. Lego has released a new 231-piece set featuring figures based off of real women who worked for NASA, including Sally Ride, the first American female astronaut, and Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space.</p>
<p class="p4">“I really hope to normalize the idea that women have been in these fields for a long time and have contributed to NASA since its earliest days,” said Maia Weinstock ’99, the woman behind the whole idea. She added that she hopes that it will help boys understand that women, too, belong in STEM areas.</p>
<p class="p4">For girls, the figures can act as miniature role models in fields such as engineering, math or science, where they might feel inferior or unwelcome as females, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">“There’s that phrase — if you can see it, you can be it — and in a lot of toys and books and movies you don’t necessarily see many STEM role models for girls,” Weinstock added.</p>
<p class="p4">When young girls are out looking at a toy and they see that it doesn’t offer female protagonists, they may start to develop a sense that they don’t belong in those fields, Weinstock said. It’s important to start young and help girls understand that they can be leaders, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">A child’s surroundings have the power to inspire and motivate young minds, said Elizabeth Silber, physicist, planetary scientist and postdoctoral research fellow at the University.</p>
<p class="p4">“I remember watching Star Trek as a child and thinking, ‘How wonderful would it be to explore space?’ Here I am now, doing exactly that,” Silber said.</p>
<p class="p4">In choosing the women who would be turned into figures, Weinstock took several factors into account. Since she wasn’t allowed to use anyone currently working for NASA, she looked at past scientists and astronomers to choose five women who had different focuses at NASA and different cultural backgrounds. She included women who were well-known so that the set would draw attention and also lesser-known figures to teach people about their achievements.</p>
<p class="p4">“I think it’s really, really cool that this Lego set is based on real women, because it can encourage more girls to pursue STEM when they see females who have actually made important contributions,” Silber said.</p>
<p class="p4">While the set includes two astronomers, it also features scientists and engineers to show other possible career paths that women have and can pursue.</p>
<p class="p4">For Sandra Wiseman, senior research associate in earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Brown, it’s affirming and interesting to see science brought into toys. As someone who had worked on Mars-related research in her years as an undergraduate, she enjoyed seeing Lego come out with the Curiosity Rover.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s really neat when something that’s happening in the scientific world can be immortalized as a toy,” Wiseman said. It’s even better when these toys help bring visibility to women in science, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“Role models are important because they show that ambition, perseverance and determination will get you there,” Silber said. “Just because a societal perception might imply that you shouldn’t do it, it doesn’t mean you should turn around.”</p>
<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this article said that Elizabeth Silber was an astronomer and postdoctoral research fellow at the University. In fact, she is a physicist, planetary scientist and postdoctoral research fellow at the University. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">As the sophistication of artificial intelligence continues to increase and AI moves further from the realm of science fiction, a philosophical question arises: When does the line between humans and robots fade away entirely?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Questions along this line of thought were addressed in the Veritas Forum’s panel “Can Robots Become Humans?” that took place Wednesday, Nov. 1. The panel was moderated by Thomas Doeppner, vice chair of the computer science department, who posed a number of questions to Rosalind Picard, founder and director of the Affective Computing Research Group and a Christian, and to Michael Littman, co-director of the Humanity Centered Robotics Initiative and an atheist. The sometimes differing perspectives that came from two people of different belief systems offered a multidimensional view on the intersection of humanity and artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The forum began with a question of what differentiates humans from artificial intelligence. Computer scientists work on the “body and brain” of a computer in the sense that they build the hardware and software, Littman said. One can make a “body” that resembles a human, but if the “brain” cannot make judgements, then it is easy to differentiate between humans and robots. But the line begins to blur as the software becomes more human-like. Because humans are sensitive to this sort of recognition, it would be difficult to make a robot that a human would not be able to differentiate from another human. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Significant integration already occurs between humans and robots, Picard said. Many people would willingly forgo their own body parts for those of robots, such as an augmented leg. This raises questions of immortality, which is already an obsession among humans, Picard said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A video of a robot on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon showed “Sophia” speaking with Jimmy. The robot played rock-paper-scissors against the host and even told a joke — “Maybe I should host the show,” Sophia suggested. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When she first saw the video, Picard was “shocked.” Despite these advancements, there is still room for robots to improve, she said. The robot’s ability to play rock-paper-scissors arises from technology that reads human motion, sometimes before humans can themselves, she explained. Picard is not worried about robots taking over the world, something that Sophia recommended in the video. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Littman was likewise skeptical of the demonstration, suggesting that there was perhaps a puppeteer behind the curtains.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The ethics of robotics raises more questions. In the past, unethical experimentation by computer scientists was accepted; however, the situation is different now, as this sort of testing has a real human impact, Littman said. He used the example of Facebook, which was designed to make people spend as much time on the site as possible. As the algorithms saw that people most often logged on when they were outraged, Facebook adapted to put forth more outrageous content. This unintended consequence illustrates these detrimental effects, Littman said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fear-mongering is also present in that people believe that artificial intelligence will gain control of the world. But Littman does not believe this will happen, as most humans do not want to take over the world to suppress humans, so robots designed to be like humans will be similar.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Picard pointed out that people who do learn continuously are not taking over the world, so robots doing the same thing would not try either. Programmers could always introduce a program to prevent such a takeover, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the topic of “stickiness,” or attachment to technology, Picard said that this relationship has reached the point of destroying lives. Emotions drive most of our actions, and if technology can manipulate our emotions, it can manipulate our actions as well. Robot creators should ensure that their work does not have this sort of impact in a negative way, Picard said. Litmann pointed out that if people know they are being emotionally manipulated, they will be able to prevent it in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The discussion turned to the limits of technology and the possibilities of godliness and consciousness in robots. Robots are now able to win against people in games such as Go and Chess, so it is being suggested that they handle other, more important tasks as well, Littman said. More credibility is often lent to robots as they are more objective, but they can be objective in the wrong ways, Picard pointed out. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In response to a student question, Littman said that technology is not yet able to recreate the brain’s consciousness. Consciousness is not understood, so it cannot be built, Picard said, adding that the only way she knows to create consciousness is through procreation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Another audience member asked if Christians would ever believe that robots could have a soul. Souls are thought by Christians to be given only by God and can move to new bodies, and thus, cannot be scientifically explained, Picard said. When pressed further as to whether software that can move to a new system could be a soul, she responded that she had not yet seen software comparable to a soul.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Set to move into its new space in the Engineering Research Center building next spring, the Harris Lab is the latest addition to the School of Engineering. Heading the Harris Lab is its namesake, Assistant Professor of Engineering Dan Harris, who earned his PhD in applied mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2015 and joined the University faculty this fall.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In his lab, Harris will explore the physics of micro-fluids an applications in building practical devices. The team is also interested in visualizing scientific phenomena as a means for aesthetic beauty and public engagement; Harris’ award-winning photography has been recognized by the National Science Foundation and Popular Science. Harris, who traces his interest in visual art to his artistic-minded family, said that art is a means to start the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If I came in and described the technical details of the application, it’s easy to lose people quickly,” he said. “But when leading with something like an image, … I feel like all of us can appreciate art at some level. I think that really opens the conservation and gets (people) interested in the applications of science.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Instead of performing computer simulations of the equations governing the behavior of fluids, the Harris Lab creates models through actual experiments. Using high-speed cameras, the team records near-instantaneous phenomena — like two water droplets fusing or particles bouncing off surfaces — and uses software to extract data from the footage.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Harris is a “real master of using these enhanced visualization techniques to help teach science around fluid mechanics,” said Lawrence Larson, dean of engineering and professor of engineering.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The lab currently consists of a post-doctorate student and three undergraduates, including Annika MacEwan ’18 and Isabelle Bauman ’19, who work together to study the trajectories of particles bouncing off of water surfaces.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Harris likes to build laboratory equipment himself using the 3-D printer in the lab, he said. His research “has been focused on not only the science itself, but also designing the appropriate equipment to answer these questions,” he added. MacEwan and Bauman are also building all of their testing equipment from scratch using computer design programs and 3-D printers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Engineering Kenneth Breuer ’82, who was appointed by the dean of the School of Engineering to chair the hiring committee for Dr. Harris, said that Harris’ research “is something that we thought would work well at Brown, so we were very excited when we were able to bring him to Brown.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University “is definitely making a statement by hiring Dan Harris, who is known and has been recognized by his presentation of science,” Bauman said. “Visualization really impacts the way in which we see and think about data, and this is definitely something that engages people in science.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To further Harris’ engineering research and artistic vision, he plans “to collaborate with all of the wonderful resources and the artistic community at Brown, and see how I can learn from them to improve what I do,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This winter, students and faculty are collaborating with the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra and Music School and the Los Angeles-based Miracle Project in hopes of launching a program that offers arts education and therapy for individuals with autism in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So long as it receives sufficient funding, the program will start this February and run for 12 weeks, serving students aged seven to young adults on all ranges of the autistic spectrum. The program is a continuation of Miracle Project New England, a “tremendously successful” collaborative piloted in Providence this past summer that used “music, dance and theater to bring out the often unheard voices of those on the spectrum,” according to Miracle Project founder Elaine Hall. </span></p>
<p class="p2">After receiving a grant from Bailey’s Team for Autism and an endowed grant from the Daniel Jordan Fiddle Foundation, University faculty members partnered with community organizers to create a week-long expressive arts camp with programming inspired by the Miracle Project’s “Inclusion from Within” methodology. Unlike traditional autism therapy techniques, which try to “fix” people, Hall said the Miracle Project’s approach focuses on building self-esteem and fostering understanding, allowing neurotypical individuals to participate alongside their autistic peers to “grow in compassion and insight (toward) people who learn and experience the world differently.”
“It’s very much focused on individual expression and honoring each child, young adult or aging adult for who they are and what they contribute. So much of their lives are about how they don’t measure up, how they don’t fit in, and this is a place that celebrates their uniqueness,” said Profesor of Theater Arts and Performance Studies Rachel Balaban.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The upcoming project grew out of Julie Strandberg and Rachel Balaban’s “Artists and Scientists as Partners” course, which explores the impact of art on people with neurological disorders, specifically autism and Parkinson’s disease. The course is interdisciplinary, fusing theater arts, neuroscience, public health, biology and anthropology. It allows students to become “ethnographers and participant observers,” so as to better understand neurologically affected populations, Balaban said. Hall has been a guest lecturer to Strandberg and Balaban’s class for the past five years, and it was through their conversations that the idea for the Miracle Project New England program emerged. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The winter program’s inception will depend on whether or not the partners receive a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Balaban said. “The idea is we’d do this (program) over a long period of time and develop methods to see how theater training and the expressive arts support these social skills and build confidence and reduce stress within children and young people on the spectrum. … We’re still piloting this, so it’s a little bit unknown,” Balaban said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Steven Sheinkopf, associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior, said this project will be “a wonderful opportunity for undergraduates to participate in a clinical research venture.” If they receive the necessary funding, the team will be able to form “a rather unique collaboration between the clinical research side at the hospitals and the folks like Balaban on the performance arts side,” he added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A recent University study has linked olfactory sensitivity — or one’s ability to smell — to circadian rhythm: It showed that the “biological clock plays a role in our ability to smell,” said Mary Carskadon, professor of psychiatry and human behavior and director of the Sleep for Science Research Lab.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This study effectively challenged a long-assumed dogma in the field of olfaction — the notion that smell sensitivity remains fairly stable, said Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior Rachel Herz, the study’s lead author. The previously held understanding of the olfactory trait was that, besides some variability resulting from effects of gender, age, illness and certain medications, it was “assumed that whatever your smell sensitivity was Tuesday at four o’clock is going to be the same next week Friday at 8 a.m.,” Herz said. The study suggested otherwise, showing “it’s a variable state that changes as a function of the circadian phase of the individual,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study involved 37 adolescent subjects, aged 12 to 15, and found their peak olfactory sensitivity to be around 9 p.m., while “nobody (showed) peak olfactory sensitivity from … 2:30 a.m. to 10 (a.m.),” Herz said. Carskadon emphasized, despite this general trend, the timing was variable and “had different features from child to child.” The adolescents’ smell sensitivity </span>was analyzed using Sniffin’ Sticks, a series of pens with odored tips that allow measurement of the threshold at which an odor is detected. Additionally, a protocol called forced desynchrony enabled researchers to separate hours awake from circadian phase, Herz said.</p>
<p class="p4">“It’s just such a delight (when) … one of these kinds of findings emerges from this very complex method of collecting data,” Carskadon said.</p>
<p class="p4">This research was a piece of a larger project being conducted by Carskadon. The larger study looks at “whether the timing, … quantity and type of food that adolescents eat is different as a function of their body type,” she said. The idea to look more closely at smell sensitivity was born from an “aha” moment in which she realized smell sensitivity might be related to dietary habits. Herz’s expertise in smell and taste lent itself well to the project; she has a book coming out this year entitled, “Why You Eat What You Eat.”</p>
<p class="p4">Smell is a crucial sense in ways beyond its everyday implications for taste. “This is more evidence that you need to have auditory fire alarms,” since even smoke’s strong odor would likely not be enough to alert someone of danger during the nighttime period of decreased sensitivity, regardless of whether or not they were awake, Herz said.</p>
<p class="p4">Herz has speculations about the evolutionary reasoning behind peak olfaction taking place in the evening. There are “three possible reasons: It helps with satiation for food when there isn’t a lot available, it helps with potentially detecting predators when light levels are low, and … it helps for selecting (a) more compatible mate,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">This data may also have implications for clinical settings, Carskadon said. It could influence other research being done with olfaction by giving researchers a sense that their measurements could be affected by the time of day at which they are collected.</p>
<p class="p4">Chih-Ying Su, professor of neurobiology at the University of California at San Diego, said the study “was very exciting” due to its novelty and it will “open the doors” for oth<span class="s3">er studies by raising “interesting questions” from the neurobiological standpoint regarding how this modulation of sensitivity occurs.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University struggles to keep up as AI industry booms</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has exploded, enabling leaps in computer image recognition, speech translation, robotic movement and a number of fields with wide-ranging implications. Based on improved techniques originally developed in the 1950s, researchers have been able to train computers to recognize patterns using large data sets and complex statistical techniques. Companies such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook have led the push, hiring hundreds of researchers in the field, implementing AI in their products and creating research groups focused on tackling major issues in the field.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The explosive growth in AI led by the private sector has heavily impacted the computer science department over the last five years, leading to ballooning AI course enrollment, increased faculty numbers and an evolving sabbatical system.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Ballooning Course Sizes</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">CS recently surpassed Economics as the most popular concentration at the University. As more students have flocked to the concentration, rising course enrollment has placed an increasingly heavy burden on professors.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Previously, CSCI 1430: “Computer Vision” had 28 students enrolled in Fall 2009. Now it has over 100 students. Similarly, enrollment for CSCI 1460: “Computational Linguistics” jumped from 19 to 104 students between 2010 and 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Professor of Computer Science Michael Littman has witnessed these changes firsthand. Littman has taught and conducted research in AI since the 1990s, when the field was still relatively niche. This semester, Littman is teaching CSCI 2951F: “Learning and Sequential Decision Making.” A graduate-level class initially capped at 20, the course now contains 44 students.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Assistant Professor of Computer Science George Konidaris has felt the </span><span class="s4">tidal shift as well. Konidaris teaches CSCI 1410: “Artificial Intelligence,” an introductory undergraduate AI class. The class had 48 students in spring 2009, but its numbers have more than doubled to 99 this fall. During his time teaching the class and its equivalent course at Duke University, he has seen students’ interests change. Previously, students would get interested in AI through their coursework, which is heavily focused on the topic’s theoretical aspects. “Now, students every day are reading about it in the New York Times. There’s a new article every week,” Konidaris said. As the subject’s audience has widened and its importance grown, Konidaris has adapted his teaching to broaden the scope of the class beyond theory to give students a “flavor” of what AI has to offer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>Hiring Difficulties</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The rapidly increasing pace of AI and the computer science field in general has placed staffing burdens on the department as well. Five or 10 years ago, topics like AI and data science were barely on the radar, said Ugur Cetintemel, chair of the computer science department. Today, the department is racing to hire faculty to stay on track with peer institutions. This year, the department added Daniel Ritchie, assistant professor of computer science, and Ellie Pavlick, who will join the faculty in spring 2018 as an assistant professor.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The department has also increasingly relied on lecturers, who solely teach and are hired on more tentative contracts. The department also seeks to add a new lecturer for some of the introductory courses next fall, Cetintemel said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">But these additions are not enough to keep up with course sizes and other universities. Peer institutions’ CS departments are bigger and growing faster, Cetintemel said. For example, while Brown added only one new tenure-track professor for CS for this semester, Princeton added eight, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The department has been forced to reckon with the lure of industry as well. Offering salaries that are sometimes double or triple what Brown pays, according to several University sources, large tech companies like Google and Microsoft are increasingly attracting PhD students studying AI who might otherwise enter academia. These firms have many other material advantages over academia as well, including large data sets, huge processing power and a less restricted budget to bolster their AI endeavors. With a large talent pool and research teams focused on improving products, tech companies have contributed large amounts of high quality research.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><b>Sabbatical Changes</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Tempted by these attractions, professors have increasingly turned to the industry for sabbaticals and, to a lesser extent, full-time jobs. The attraction of private industry is not new to computer science; during the tech boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, computer science departments across the country were often left gutted by large companies looking for top talent, Littman said. Nowadays, while some similar poachings have taken place at universities like Carnegie Mellon University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, some of the field’s brightest minds are now shared by academia and industry. Last year, Littman went on sabbatical to tour companies to get a better sense of the work they were doing. Stefanie Tellex, assistant professor of computer science, has considered taking a similar sabbatical, Cetintemel said, adding that she will potentially explore a robotics research project in the private industry in Boston.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">While the department has sabbatical procedures in place, students and colleagues are often left to scramble when a faculty member leaves. Graduate students, who are typically dependent on a single professor as their advisor and mentor, can be left without strong guidance. Additionally, professors are often forced to switch their teaching responsibilities at the last minute.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Cetintemel said the department needs to reevaluate its sabbatical procedures in light of the changes brought on by AI. If faculty members are increasingly taking sabbaticals, the department will need to establish a new model that covers these professors’ teaching loads and graduate students. Graduate students could potentially work under multiple professors instead of one, leaving them with at least one advisor should another decide to go on sabbatical. Additionally, the faculty size can be expanded to adjust for those on sabbatical.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Though the recent boom in AI driven by private industry has certainly affected the department, many faculty members viewed the changes as complementary to the University. Research at tech companies today is fundamentally different from university research, Konidaris said. Tech companies focus their research on short-term goals and only make incremental improvements. At universities, researchers tackle issues that have 100-year time frames instead of five- or 10-year ones. For example, researchers at Brown are able to pull from research conducted across the University, said Pavlick, who does work in natural language processing. By doing so, she can complete projects that would be impossible at a private company, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The field of artificial intelligence continues to explode, both at the University and across the world. Locally, the Humanity-Centered Robotics Initiative, co-directed by Littman, recently partnered with Hasbro to bring robotic AI-powered pets to the elderly. At Google, researchers have created machine learning algorithms that train themse</span><span class="s3">lves. While no one knows how long this current boom will last, Brown is forced to adapt to these changes on the fly, fighting to remain competitive.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">University researchers recently demonstrated a method to significantly modify the spatial coherence of light. The results could offer more options for the manipulation of light in nanotechnology, and may even allow researchers to improve communication via lasers. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the fundamental properties of light is coherence, which determines the color of light, how it propagates and how it scatters, said Taco Visser, professor of theoretical physics at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The modulation of light coherence can therefore be conceptualized as a tool to tune its other properties, he explained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The coherence of light is typically measured by using Young’s famous double slit experiment, said Domenico Pacifici, associate professor of engineering and physics and co-author of the study. This experiment involves sending light through an opaque barrier with two slits and projecting it onto a screen on the other side. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If the light hitting the barrier is coherent, the rays exiting the slits interfere with each other and produce strong, dark and bright bands — called intensity fringes — on the projection screen, Pacifici said. But if the light hitting the barrier is incoherent, no intensity fringes will be produced. “The visibility of these fringes is a direct measure of the degree of coherence of the (light hitting the barrier) at the two slit locations,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">University researchers transformed Young’s double slit experiment into a mechanism to modulate the coherence of light. They replaced the opaque barrier in the original experiment with a thin metal film, so the light would interact with the electrons in the metal. Light hitting the slits in the metal film generated a special type of wave supported by oscillations of electrons within the metal, Pacifici said. The waves “propagate along the metal surface and move toward the other slit, where they mix with the (incoming) light vibration,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a result of this mixing, the incoherent light hitting the two slits becomes partially coherent, Pacifici said. This is on account of the surface plasmon waves, which act as a communication channel. Light exiting the slits is now coherent and can produce interference fringes, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By increasing the strength of the surface plasmon waves, the researchers achieved strong modulation of the coherence of incoming light. “We were able to turn totally incoherent light into highly coherent light, and vice versa,” Pacifici said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These findings lend themselves to a range of applications. One is space optical communication, which uses lasers to broadcast information through the atmosphere over long distances, said Greg Gbur, professor of physics and optical science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. However, the atmosphere’s tendency to distort light has always been a problem. As a result, “the information gets scrambled if you try to transmit over a long distance,” he said. If you adjust the spatial coherence of light, you can reduce the amount that the atmosphere distorts the light, Gbur added. Modifying the coherence of light can therefore be salient to the production of laser beams in these communications. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The research is also relevant to nanotechnology: In many detectors working on a very small scale, light can be sent in different directions by altering its coherence, Visser said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The distinguishing feature of this study is undoubtedly the degree of changes in light coherence that the researchers were able to achieve. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The paper “demonstrates that you can get really large changes in coherence,” Gbur said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is “something that wasn’t demonstrated before experimentally,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It certainly is a record,” Visser agreed. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Hasbro, the Pawtucket-based maker of beloved classics such as Monopoly and Play-Doh, will be collaborating with the University’s Humanity Centered Robotics Initiative to advance realistic robotic pet assistants for the elderly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The collaboration between the third largest toy-maker in the world and University researchers will build on Hasbro’s current line of animatronic dogs and cats, Joy for All Companion Pets. While the current pets provide comfort and companionship through purring and simple responses to petting, the upcoming project will program them to help with tasks such as finding lost items or remembering to take medication.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Funded by a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation, the project, called Affordable Robotic Intelligence for Elderly Support, aims to not only add more capabilities to the pets, but also make them more economical. Currently many robotic pet products, such as the popular PARO seal from Japan, can cost as much as $5,000-6,000, said Michael Littman, co-principal investigator on the grant and professor of computer science. By collaborating with Hasbro, whose Joy for All Companion Pets cost around $100, the team hopes to develop an affordable product.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moving an elderly person into a hospital can be a financial burden, Littman said. Going to the hospital may also make problems worse by exposing the elderly to a number of illnesses floating around, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re motivated by this question of what can we do to help people in their home environments?” Littman said. “It’s absolutely essential that we find ways to get people the services that they need.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In looking back at trend information, Hasbro found that a particular brand of toy aimed at younger children was actually more often being purchased to help an elderly loved one, said Ted Fischer, vice president for business development at Hasbro. After exploring this concept by working with seniors and communities in assisted living, they found that the lack of play in these communities allowed isolation and loneliness to persist.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We really do believe in ‘Creating the World’s Best Play Experiences’ — our tagline — and I don’t think that there should be an age limit on this,” Fischer said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the main priorities in the toys’ development has been making them as realistic as possible, whether it be in appearance, feel or response to actions. For example, the designers and animatronic engineers paid close attention to making the kitten have tapered rather than straight whiskers, a vibrational purr and randomized responses to petting, just like a real kitten would.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hasbro has decades of animatronics experiences, but working with Brown will bring in more cognitive and computer science expertise. The group will perform research and studies with senior citizens to better understand their needs and figure out what the research can do to help them the most, said Bertram Malle, co-director of the Humanity Centered Robotics Initiative and professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If you live on your own, there may be no way to even find your glasses, and asking someone to help can be an emotional burden,” Malle said. With these new pets, users may be able to ask, ‘Where are my glasses?’ and be guided to a misplaced object through nudges and sounds.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both parties said the opportunity to combine their various areas of expertise within the Rhode Island community to create an impactful product is extremely exciting.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“As a computer scientist, I’m getting to interact with behavioral scientists and clinicians and toy engineers that really care about how our design can touch people’s lives,” Littman said. “We want to make a product that makes a difference.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">University researchers analyzed object and facial recognition in six- and ten-month-old infants for a study published in Developmental Science. Kristen Tummeltshammer, postdoctoral fellow, and Dima Amso, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences, collaborated on an experiment in which babies were tasked with using contextual cues in order to locate faces on a screen.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> An arrangement of four dots were displayed and, after a short time, were flipped to reveal either an animated face or mere objects. Though the arrangement would alternate randomly, half of the time the same arrangement would reappear, leading the babies to react and locate the face faster due to quick learning and association of the face’s location.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The results point toward remarkable cognitive development in this skill early on in infancy. Babies “are efficient in using the structure in their environment to maximize attentional resources on the one hand and to reduce uncertainty and distraction on the other,” said Amso in a University press release. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We’re always interested (in our lab) in understanding how infants and young children typically develop,” said Tummeltshammer. “If we can understand how these abilities are developing early on in a typical population then we can apply it to neurodevelopmental disorders,” she added. The research also helps illuminate the building blocks of cognition. “We would hope we are tapping into mechanisms that are fundamental to human cognition. … These are attentional and learning strategies that we take through our whole life,” Tummeltshammer said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> The study has received praise from outside experts in the field of cognitive development. Janet Frick, associate professor of behavioral and brain sciences at the University of Georgia and Julie Markant, assistant professor at Tulane University, both commented on the study’s goals and design. “It’s a very creative study and a great use of eye-tracking to ask some higher-level questions about the early development of cognition,” said Frick. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I thought the design was really creative. … It’s really the first paper to look at this concept of contextual cuing in infancy,” said Markant.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Both researchers had high hopes for the implications of the research. “Any time that we have a better understanding of how early cognitive development typically emerges, then that’s going to be useful for identifying deviations to that, and trying to identify ways of intervening,” Frick said. “As developmental scientists, we are always thinking about the fact that understanding typical development is going inform our understanding of atypical development,” Markant said. “This is a stepping stone, because we need to know what is supposed to happen in order to understand what goes awry.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Plans for future experiments are also on the horizon. “With this study, it’s going to be scaling up the complexity of the scenes we’re presenting to infants and seeing whether they can take this skill of using contextual cues into a more naturalistic environment,” Tummeltshammer said. The researchers are intrigued by the real-life applications of these cues, Tummeltshammer said. “Hopefully we are tapping into something that is fundamental about human learning,” she added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dark matter — a form of elusive mass theorized to make up a majority of the matter in the universe — has thus far gone undetected. But U</span><span class="s2">niversity professors have proposed a </span><span class="s1">new way to detect dark matter, bringing new insight that could change how dark matter is found. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Scientists know dark matters exists because of its gravitational effects on galaxies and its bending of light, said Derek Stein, associate professor of physics and engineering and co-author of the study along with Humphrey Maris, professor emeritus of physics, and George Seidel, professor emeritus of physics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The dark matter detector, which would use superfluid liquid helium, has the ability to reveal the existence of dark matter through a “chain of events,” Stein said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A dark matter particle would bump into an atom of helium. This would then create enough energy to knock a few atoms of helium from a liquid to a gas state. This starts the series of events that ultimately produces an incremental change in temperature detected by the apparatus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The new method for detection became necessary because researchers were unable to detect dark matter at higher masses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Most of the large-scale dark matter searches so far have been looking for particles with a mass somewhere between 10 and 10,000 times the mass of a proton,” Stein said in a press release. Maris explained that, to find dark matter, researchers had to start looking for the mysterious substance in other mass ranges</span><span class="s3">. “If you lose your keys, you don’t just check out the bathroom,” Maris said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Perhaps the dark matter is made of particles with very light mass, and maybe they do collide with ordinary matter at a reasonable rate. … The energy that they deposit when they do that is too small for anybody to detect so far. We’re detecting th</span><span class="s3">ose very small energies,” Maris added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Daniel McKinsey, the Georgia Lee distinguished professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley, said there are already different kinds of dark matter detectors in use. For example, the Large Underground Xenon experiment and the LUX-Zeplin detectors work to find dark matter particles using liquid xenon. “Superfluid helium is very promising for detecting so-called light dark matter, with mass less than that of the (weakly interacting massive particle). … This is an important mass window that may be hiding the dark matter,” McKinsey wrote in an email to The Herald. “If it works then it would be a real game-changer, and allow us to search for dark matter that is 1,000 times lower in mass than can be found using existing techniques,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Unlike other dark matter detectors, the new test registers the collision between dark matter and helium differently than other detectors do, Stein said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the advantages of this new method, Stein added, is the possible other ways that the technology can be used outside of the detection of dark matter, which range from medical imaging to observing the process of nuclear reactions to spotting other kinds of astronomical events. “Anything that causes these little helium atoms to bump and move will set the thing off. Think about tackling problems where sensitivity is at a premium,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Being able to detect dark matter would be an enormous step forward in physics. Probably one of the most im</span><span class="s4">portant things one could do,” Maris said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A recent University study published in Nature explored ways to prevent one of the most pertinent issues in engineering: material fatigue. In studies of specialized structures called nanotwins within metals, University researchers — led by Huajian Gao, professor of engineering — saw reduced strain effects of repeated stress on metals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Metal fatigue is a central topic of study in materials science, with applications ranging from building longer lasting airplanes and bridges to designing moving parts in smartphones and pacemakers. But studying the effects of stress on metal is very complex, said Haofei Zhou, a post-doctoral researcher working with Gao. “It is quite an important field, but very complicated because the stress and strain are always changing, so we can never predict the fatigue life of a metal.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The researchers delved into the complicated realm of materials science by observing experimental results from collaborators at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who tested the effects of stress on copper samples with nanotwin boundaries.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Metals are made out of small crystals that compose the “grains” of the material. Each of these crystals has a distinct orientation, and the areas between the crystals are called grain boundaries.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“A nanotwin boundary means the crystals have mirror symmetry across the grain,” Gao said. Nanotwin boundaries are incrediblly dense — “on the nanometer scale, so you can think of twin boundaries as one of the perfect grain boundaries.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Boundaries are notable because they can prevent the movement of dislocations: areas that are sites of deformation. The movement of a dislocation is similar to a wrinkle moving through a carpet, Gao said. “When the wrinkle is moving, it propagates from one side to another and the carpet gets shifted a little bit,” which is “how metals deform,” Gao said. “Normally, the strength is low because it’s easy to propagate a wrinkle. But imagine you put a boundary that will make the wrinkle harder to dislocate and move — this increases the strength of the material.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By creating nanotwins, Gao’s group aimed to stop the propagation of dislocations and increase the strength of the metal samples. “Copper’s strength is very low, but nanotwinning can make it more than ten times stronger,” Gao said. Zhou added that “after 10,000 stress cycles, we barely saw damage accumulation inside of the grain.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As with most scientific studies, however, conclusions and applications are limited in scope. David Nowell, professor of engineering science at the University of Oxford and editor of the Journal of Strain Analysis, commended the University’s study for its identification of unique “necklace” dislocations and results, but said there was a gap between the conclusions and practical applications.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“One doesn’t tend to use copper in any application where you want structural strength,” Nowell said. “But one needs studies like this to put the basic science in place for what might be 10 or 20 years down the track.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Atieh Moridi, a post-doctoral mechanical engineering research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the study holds promise and approaches an old problem in a new way. “There’s still a lot of room for further development to be able to upscale such a process and make it less dependent on the twinning orientation,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Gao also mentioned the financial and technical constraints associated with inducing metals with the nanotwin boundaries. But existing twinned materials such as Twinning-Induced Plasticity steel and certain alloys show “extraordinary properties” and have garnered interest from car manufacturers and the defense industry, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The failure of materials has been studied for over a century and is vital to increasing the longevity of items integral to modern life, but the progress of the complex field is very slow, Gao said. “Generally, we haven’t found an effective way of controlling fatigue,” he said. “I think that’s part of the reason why our work has been accepted by the journal Nature — it is a new idea in a very difficult, challenging field.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Professor provides health care to displaced Rohingya refugees</title>

<p class="p1">Every day, Ruhul Abid, assistant professor of surgery, and his team set up their makeshift tent in Bangladesh and check the height, weight, blood pressure, blood glucose and hemoglobin levels of around 300 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. Having spent days crossing mountain, sea and jungle, the refugees have little more than the sparse clothes on their backs. One-fifth of them are severely malnourished children under the age of six. Many of the women have been sexually assaulted. None of them has ever received any type of vaccination. One boy has a bullet wound in his head.</p>
<p class="p2">“When I heard about (the Rohingya persecution from Myanmar), I couldn’t sleep. Every night, I was just thinking, what can I do?” Abid said.</p>
<p class="p2">Abid, who grew up in Bangladesh, began his health work in the country following the garment-factory collapse in Dhaka that killed 1,129 people. He mobilized a team of paramedics to provide free-of-charge health care to the exploited laborers who worked around 10 hours a day, six days a week.</p>
<p class="p2">When he saw images in the media of the starving, ill and abused Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, Abid immediately reached out to his Dhaka team about providing urgently needed health care.</p>
<p class="p2">“Those pictures moved me. I planned my small team — we went there, set up four tables and served,” Abid said. He, along with 15 others, moved 8,000 miles across the world on Oct. 9 and set up two eight-member centers.</p>
<p class="p2">Although their four tables were initially set up to check for simple problems, they often exposed larger health issues.</p>
<p class="p2">“Once I looked down at this boy with a terrycloth tied around his head holding his medical card to get his height and weight checked. … I went ahead and took off the cloth and he had an infected bullet wound that went from the side of his eye to the back of his ear,” said Jane Carter, a doctor on Abid’s team.</p>
<p class="p2">“I’ve seen babies 10 days old, whose mothers were giving birth while crossing the border,” Abid said.</p>
<p class="p2">Because the Myanmar government stripped the Rohingya of their citizenship in 1992, none of the refugees has had any sort of polio, measles, HIV or tuberculosis vaccines. In fact, there is practically no record of the Rohingya existing at all.</p>
<p class="p2">“We are finding records of all of these diseases. We are finding sexual assault victims who do not talk about their experiences until our female workers ask them in confidentiality. They are malnourished. The hygiene is horrible. Vaccine centers are overflowing. But we are trying to do everything we can to help,” Abid said.</p>
<p class="p2">Abid’s team not only exposes these diseases and connects patients to treatments and support centers, but they have also created an electronic system that tracks every refugee they have seen so that they can follow up.</p>
<p class="p2">“Every month, we’re seeing around 7,500 patients, and we have electronic medical records for all of them,” Abid said. His team is the first to create such a system, which relies on solar energy to generate electricity in the remote area.</p>
<p class="p2">Each refugee patient receives a laminated barcode that can be scanned to follow up on previously received diagnoses or treatments. The collected health data is then sent to the United Nations Population Fund and the Ministry of Health in Bangladesh to provide the Bangladesh government with patient profiles and data on the health care received.</p>
<p class="p2">Abid, who has briefly returned to America to improve the project’s systems, will go back to Bangladesh in two weeks to continue his work with the Rohingya until at least Dec. 31. The continuation of his work, however, depends on funds and donations. Currently, most of the funds that support him were found through the help of Brown’s Global Health Initiative, which “funds students for multidisciplinary global work and helps faculty members find the connections and funding they need to do their work,” said Susan Cu-Uvin, director of the initiative.</p>
<p class="p2">With over half a million refugees within an area less than one-fourth the size of Rhode Island, the makeshift camps are overflowing, Abid said.</p>
<p class="p2">“These people are not going to go back to their homes anytime soon,” Abid said. “This is an international problem. It’s such a huge disaster. And we need to provide health care.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Climate and Development Lab attends COP23 in Germany</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Nations from across the world congregated in Bonn, Germany to discuss climate agreements and how they could battle climate change for the United Nations Climate Change Conference 23rd Conference of the Parties. Among the delegates, organizations and other attendees were members from the Climate and Development Lab at Brown.</p>
<p class="p2">The conference stretched from Nov. 6 to Nov. 17, with six of the 12 undergraduate students in the CDL going the first week and the other six going the second, said Julianna Bradley ’17.5, one of the students in the CDL. Preparation for the conference took place largely in the class ENVS 1575: “Engaged Climate Policy at the UN Climate Change Talks,” which was taught by J. Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and co-founder and co-director of the CDL, said Emma Bouton ’20, another student in the CDL. Students had a set of core readings, which included topics such as the history of the climate talks, climate vulnerability and financing, gender and loss and damage, said Stacy-Ann Robinson, postdoctoral research associate and member of the CDL. Students also worked on individual and group projects, she said.</p>
<p class="p2">The students spent their time at COP23 working on “embedded” projects with organizations assigned to them before COP23. For Bradley, this meant working with Oxfam America, an organization that aims to reduce poverty. Oxfam sent delegates from their climate subsection to COP23, and Bradley attended negotiations for them, taking notes so she could report back. For Bouton, this meant working with the Global Island Partnership, for which she would attend events and work with social media. Other students worked with groups such as the United Nations Development Programme, Climate Home, the chair of the Least Developed Countries and the International Centre for Climate Change and Development.</p>
<p class="p2">The students also worked on independent projects while at COP23. Each student focused on a specific issue, deciding which negotiations and events to attend and which people to contact. Bradley’s project involved working with a group called Climate Home and looking at cities’ participation in meeting U.S. climate agreements.</p>
<p class="p2">Bradley said approaching and interacting with people involved in climate action was one of the best parts of COP23. Though there was a hierarchy with pink-badged “delegates” holding higher positions than yellow-badged “observers,” it was not rigid. “Anyone would talk to anyone,” she said. Bradley recalled standing in line at a coffee shop and recognizing the man behind her as the mayor of Carmel, Indiana, the only Republican politician in the U.S. delegation badge at the conference. She introduced herself, and they conversed for 45 minutes about climate change.</p>
<p class="p2">Bouton said that the conference was overwhelming, but she was disheartened by the slow pace of progress. The United Nations structures negotiations in a flawed way that allows them to continually push back decision-making, she said.</p>
<p class="p2">Guy Edwards, co-founder and co-director of the CDL, agreed that decision-making regarding climate change was occurring too slowly; however, he said that the shift to a low-carbon economy is now undeniable. “Far more needs to happen, but this process is an important step forward,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Earth is a dynamic system, constantly in motion both above and below its surface. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The movement of layers below the surface that compose the Earth’s mantle influence the movement of several rigid plates on the surface. This churning mixes different materials within the mantle, generating unique masses of matter. These blobs — referred to as mantle heterogeneities by geologists — vary in size, ranging from a few centimeters to thousands of kilometers in diameter.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Utilizing constraints on both the composition and size of these masses, scientists hope to explore how mantle flow drives the movement of tectonic plates. Geochemists have analyzed the composition of rock samples from mid-ocean ridges to infer the makeup and occasionally the size of these masses. This type of study is limited naturally by its small scale, as geographical areas analyzed may be as small as a few centimeters in length. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Researchers have also used seismic waves generated by earthquakes — which produce larger scale data —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to gather information about these heterogeneities. These studies cover areas of 10 to 100 kilometers in length.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, few researchers have studied an intermediate length scale of just a few kilometers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A new study co-authored by Boda Liu GS and Yan Liang, professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences, sheds new light on magma generation processes that reveal mantle heterogeneities of one to 10 kilometers in size. By focusing on the intermediate scale, the study fills the knowledge gap regarding the size of heterogeneous masses generated by the mantle flow to the surface. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Liu and Liang centered their research on Neodymium isotope variations between magmas and residue rocks called peridotites, which were sampled along mid-ocean ridges. Like fingerprints, Neodymium isotopes can be used to trace mantle materials of different compositions or origins. The team found that the magma from the mantle — which rises to the top of the tectonic plate to form new surface crust — had a relatively uniform Neodymium isotope composition, while the residue peridotites were more heterogenous and had a different average composition compared to the magma.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The group was able to explain this difference through its discovery that the size of heterogeneous mantle masses beneath mid-ocean ridges is significant. The magma is mobile and thus able to mix more efficiently beneath mid-ocean ridges, while heterogeneous blobs in the residue do not easily mix with surroundings unless the size of masses inside them is smaller than one kilometer, Liu and Liang said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Based on their findings, Liu and Liang concluded that masses on kilometer scale must be widely distributed in the mantle, a new finding in the field. Based off their work, the team hopes that the broader scientific community will help explain how deep mantle processes produce these masses, Liu and Liang said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Richard Katz, professor of geodynamics at the University of Oxford, wrote in an email to The Herald that the paper was a substantial contribution to the field, providing insight regarding a scale of study on heterogeneities that is often difficult to quantify.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Boda Liu and Yan Liang are among the few people in the world who are addressing this challenge,” Katz wrote. “There is still much to do in this area of research but this paper establishes an avenue of progress and takes a large step down it.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Neurodatathon premiers in four-day event</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Students worked with state-of-the-art tools to uncover patterns in a never-before analyzed neural data set at Brown’s first-ever Neurodatathon Nov. 28 to Dec. 2.</p>
<p class="p2">Hosted by Brown Data Science and sponsored by the Brown Institute for Brain Science and the Brown Initiative for Computation in Brain and Mind, the Neurodatathon challenged students to analyze a neural data set with a variety of machine learning and deep learning methods.</p>
<p class="p2">“What we were hoping, by introducing this brand new data set, was that students would have an opportunity to figure out interesting characteristics about the data and also (discover) optimal ways of filtering it, so that optimal results can be obtained when doing scientific analysis,” said Drew Linsley, postdoctoral research associate in cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences.</p>
<p class="p2">“We had 140 students sign up, who had concentrations ranging from physics and computer science to neuroscience and psychology,” Linsley said.</p>
<p class="p2">With students coming from such wide-ranging fields, the event featured two tracks of competition, each demanding a different set of skills and interests. Participants either formed teams or worked independently, competing in one of the two tracks.</p>
<p class="p2">The “Optimize” track tended to be the choice for programmers and deep learning and machine learning enthusiasts. In this track, the goal was to build a model that most accurately interpreted neural behavior, as given by the data set. The two groups whose models generated the most accurate results won the competition.</p>
<p class="p2">The “Create” track involved scientific analysis and was chosen more often by students with stronger neuroscience backgrounds. Because the provided data set had never been analyzed before, participants were given lots of freedom and an opportunity to come up with scientifically significant analysis. Three neuroscience and data science experts judged the analysis submitted by the participants, and the two winners were chosen for the impact and creativity of their submissions.</p>
<p class="p2">“In a perfect world, you would be an expert in both (computing and neuroscience), but of course it’s very difficult to get this kind of training, especially at the undergraduate level,” Linsley said. “Our special two-track competition catered to the two different types of students interested — the programmers who had more technical skill and the neuroscientists who had more knowledge about the brain.”</p>
<p class="p2">Because many of the participants had limited or no experience with machine learning algorithms, neural data sets and even data science in general, the organizers of the event hosted workshops. In addition, office hours were held every day during the event, giving participants opportunities to talk to deep learning and neuroscience experts.</p>
<p class="p2">A hacking space was offered for participants at night, giving students a place to work on projects and providing them access to experts. The workshops prior to the Neurodatathon “made the event much less daunting,” said Dylan Sam ’21. “It was a little bit of an introduction and walkthrough, which was really great. The experts did a really good job explaining the concepts to (participants).”</p>
<p class="p2">Mariel Rosic ’20 agreed that the workshop was a helpful aspect of the event. “The postdocs and grad students were so helpful,” she said. “I learned so much by talking to them, and it almost felt like a series of one-on-one machine learning sessions that helped me with my analysis.”</p>
<p class="p2">Participants and event hosts agreed that the event set a positive precedent for future Neurodatathons.</p>
<p class="p2">“We ended up finding some really interesting analysis, discovering interesting relationships between brain and behavior that we didn’t expect we would find,” Linsley said. The Brown Data Science Initiative will continue hosting events next semester, with plans of coordinating another Neurodatathon<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in the near future, he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University’s Circumpolar Lab explores Arctic</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/12/07/universitys-circumpolar-lab-explores-arctic/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">As temperatures drop, University researchers continue studying the wintry climes of the North at the University’s renowned Circumpolar Laboratory.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The lab is tucked away in the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology’s Collections Research Center in Bristol. Founded in 1973 by Douglas Anderson, the lab was created as a part of the University’s program in anthropology. It is the “federal repository for important ethnographic and archaeological collections primarily from northwestern Alaska,” according to its website.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">In celebration of the Haffenreffer’s 60th anniversary, the museum created an exhibition entitled “Northern Horizons, Global Visions: J. Louis Giddings and the Invention of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology.” The exhibition, currently held at Manning Hall, explores the life and work of the Haffenreffer’s first director and displays some of the artifacts from the Circumpolar Lab’s collections.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Despite its vast archives and rich history, the Circumpolar Lab appears to be largely unheard of by the Brown community. The reason for this seems to be twofold: The Haffenreffer’s Research Center is not open to the public, and it is not located on campus. Nevertheless, individuals involved with the Circumpolar Lab and with Arctic research appreciate the value of the laboratory and the artifacts it houses.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>A chilly history</b></p>
<p class="p4">The history of the Circumpolar Lab begins with the Haffenreffer’s first diector, J. Louis Giddings, said Kevin Smith, deputy director and chief curator of the museum. Until 1955, the museum was privately owned by the Haffenreffer family. But when its founder passed away, the family gave the museum to Brown. Since Brown had no archeology department at the time, the University hired Giddings, a “pioneering Arctic archeologist,” to be its first director, Smith explained.</p>
<p class="p4">Giddings came to Brown in 1956 and began taking students with him to the Arctic to conduct research, Smith said. The artifacts Giddings and his students excavated came back to Bristol, where they were housed in the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Haffeneffer. “Unfortunately in 1964, at the peak of his productivity, Giddings was involved in a car accident and passed away a week later,” Smith said. Douglas Anderson, a former Brown graduate student of Giddings, took over Gidding’s position in the Department of Anthropology and continued on with the Arctic program at Brown.</p>
<p class="p4">“In 1973, I established the lab for circumpolar studies,” said Douglas Anderson, emeritus professor of anthropology. He aimed to enable students to take courses in Arctic studies and provide research opportunities for them in Alaska and Northern Canada. When the lab was first established, it was formed as a part of Brown’s program in anthropology, Anderson said. However, “in the last four to five years, the Department of Anthropology has shifted its geographical focus away from the Arctic” and it became clear that “for the laboratory to function well, it could no longer be a part of the academic program — it needed to be fully handed over to the (Haffenreffer).” The laboratory continues to be run by the museum in Bristol.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>The lab today</b></p>
<p class="p4">While the lab may be located “19 miles off campus, and it is hard to bring students down to work with the collections,” it still remains “very active,” Smith explained, adding that in the past 10 years, the lab received almost $2 million in federal grants to conduct research. One of the lab’s ongoing projects concerns viking and medieval archeology. Another research project focuses on “the roles of women and their production — from the Canadian Arctic, all the way to Norway and Denmark,” Smith described. The lab is also currently working with x-ray fluorescence, Smith said ­­— ­a method used to examine the elemental composition of objects, in order to trace where they came from and how far they moved.</p>
<p class="p4">The collections at the Circumpolar Lab continue to fascinate many researchers. “The collections we have here go back to the end of the last ice age, spanning 11-12,000 years of pre-history,” Smith described. They consist of various “archeological materials — anything that has been brought back from the Arctic on expeditions,” Anderson said. The 800,000-850,000 objects in the lab’s collections include a unique pair of snow goggles. Snow goggles, in general, help to keep the glare of the ice and snow from blinding the wearer, Smith said. “But these ones are actually made to also make the face of the hunter take on the characteristics of the seals that he’s hunting,” he added. “The holes for the eyes actually have the tear ducts that the seal has.”</p>
<p class="p4">Another feature that sets Brown’s circumpolar lab and Arctic researchers apart is their approach to consulting with native communities. This originates from Giddings’ own method of collaborating with indigenous groups, which was unlike the reseach of most archeologists at the time and made everything that Brown did “different and important — and very ethically responsible from a very early time,” Smith explained.</p>
<p class="p4">Gentis said these consultations with the native peoples have a dual benefit: They enable researchers to identify the artifacts and understand how they were used and give indigenous communities “a window into their past.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanks of luminescent jellyfish and rippling seaweed line the walls of an open space on the bottom floor of the Rhode Island School of Design’s Nature Lab. But a transformation is underway; by the end of 2018, the room will become a “maker space” inviting students to conceptualize and engineer nature-inspired systems to address real-world issues. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re very interested in employing natural technology — looking at how nature works as an ecosystem in a way that human beings don’t,” said Jennifer Bissonnette, biological programs designer at RISD and a leader of the project. “We create so much waste. We’ve created so many environmental problems and social problems because of the way our society functions.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/07/science-art-converge-risd-nature-lab/">Nature Lab</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently contains tens of thousands of preserved specimens, as well as live animals and tools like electron microscopes, that all serve to connect students with art and science. After its redesign, the maker space will offer Brown and RISD students an area to experiment with biomaterials and design interventions for the urban environment, Bissonnette said. The project will also produce curricula for high school students, which RISD students will implement in local high schools. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of our role is to support the campus community by demonstrating the ways in which there are not only historical and cultural influences on art and design, but also biological influences,” said Neal Overstrom, director of the Nature Lab.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction began with the installation of a green wall: Leafy plants sprout horizontally from a large panel, dominating the southern wall of the space with countless shades of the hue. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, students will be intimately involved in the design of the lab as it is brought to life. A wintersession course, in which students create interventions that could become part of the project, will be followed by a spring course focused on producing prototypes specifically for the Nature Lab space. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The design of the space will revolve around the idea of biophilia, or humans’ tendency to connect with nature. Facets of nature that resonate with people, like the fractal branching of trees and patterns of scattered light, are the focus of biophilia, Bissonnette said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Elements resembling nature will be built into the space as part of the biophilic design, according Kylie King, a RISD graduate student studying material architecture and a research assistant at the Nature Lab. King is collaborating on a lighting installation inspired by kelp bladders. Paper was made by hand from phragmites and knotweed — invasive plant species from Rhode Island — and used to construct pods that will hang from the ceiling.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The space will make use of “symbolic references to patterns found in nature and numerical arrangements that persist in nature,” King said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A body of research in environmental psychology shows that connecting with nature can improve well-being and facilitate learning, Overstrom said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Serving as a point of entry for those unfamiliar with STEM fields, the space will provide students with a “hands-on studio experience where they’re gaining understanding of scientific concepts and engineering concepts,” Bissonnette added. “Suddenly, they have agency over some of the issues they see confronting them in their world.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is funded by an EAGER grant from the National Science Foundation, which provides funding for “exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches,” according to the NSF website.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nature Lab seeks to renew the connection between humans and nature by revamping this part of its space. “Historically, progress has been measured by the degree to which we often distance ourselves from the natural world,” Overstrom said. “Our hope is that through these kinds of projects, these students will come to believe the exact opposite to be true.”</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While nuclear magnetic resonance technology has long been used in physics to study materials, it has not been especially effective at analyzing small, thin substances. New research from University scientists published in the Review of Scientific Instruments unveils how the orientation of coils matters and can drastically increase the quality of results obtained by NMR analysis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">NMR technology works by placing an object inside of a cylindrical coil to bombard the object with radio waves, causing nuclei within the object to give off signals that offer scientists information about its composition. Because the coils use particles of the object for analysis, objects with a large number of particles have better readings, meaning that small, flat nanomaterials are extremely difficult to analyze under the traditional coils. The researchers found that using flat coils instead of cylindrical coils creates more accurate readings of these objects, expanding the scope of what can be analyzed with NMR technology, said Wencong Liu PhD’17, co-lead author of the study.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The research was born out of the issues associated with the previous NMR technique, said Vesna Mitrovic, associate professor of physics and co-lead author of the study. Because different geometries of the coil allow enhanced readings of these objects, the paper investigated optimal geometries for particular objects. Scientists are now better able to determine the properties of these small objects, which is extremely useful in a large number of areas, such as in making electronic devices, Mitrovic said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This solved a prominent issue within NMR technology, said Kemp Plumb, assistant professor of physics. Because scientists previously used round coils in their experiment, they had difficulty studying square objects, since it resulted in an overabundance of empty space. The same kind of excess space existed when NMR is used to study small objects, rendering the technique ineffective.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">These findings could contribute to Plumb’s area of research, which is the study of magnetism and “exotic” materials, or materials that have uncommon properties. Plumb’s work specifically focuses on the atomic-level activity that gives rise to the macroscopic aspects of an object. One example is superconducting material, or material that conducts electricity similarly to metal but is unique in that it has no resistance. The properties of the superconductor are only possible due to the activity of its electrons. NMR technology will allow him to study substances on a microscopic level to aid understanding of how these kinds of characteristics arise. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This finding also broadly expands the scope of what NMR technology can do in scientific research. The new method allows the materials being analyzed to be manipulated in a number of ways, such as applying stress or voltage, Liu said. This was not possible beforehand, as the previous method involved enclosing the object.</span></p>
<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that electrons within an object give off signals during Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis. In fact, nuclei within an object give off signals during Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University scientists use simulations to study proteins associated with ALS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A new University study published in Molecular Cell examined the specific amino acid changes that cause damaging processes associated with ALS and the dementia that results from it. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more commonly known as ALS, is a disease involving the death of neurons that control voluntary muscles. As these neurons die, patients lose the ability to control these muscles, and eventually lose the abilities to speak, eat, move and even breathe. The research studies the disease at a molecular level, following the way changes in amino acid sequences can affect the behavior of the family of proteins linked to the disease. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are two types of ALS: Sporadic ALS, which accounts for about 90 to 95 percent of ALS cases, can affect anyone and any area of the body, while familial ALS, accounting for 5 to 10 percent of ALS cases, refers to inherited cases of the disease.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Right now, no effective treatments exist for either form of the disease, but the best upcoming treatments focus on familial ALS. “For the rest of the patients, we’re trying to understand how to change the protein directly,” said Nicolas Fawzi, assistant professor of medical science and co-author of the study.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Many of the proteins associated with the disease contain “low-complexity regions,” which, unlike parts of proteins that we traditionally study, are disordered and lack definite structure. These proteins are flexible, constantly changing shape. Fawzi explained that while scientists do not have a clear understanding of these proteins, due to the lack of clear, structural images, they know them to be functionally important.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some of these proteins undergo phase transition, forming droplets in the cells similar to those we see when oils are mixed with water, Wayne Bowen, professor of pharmacology, explained. These droplets, known as membrane-less organelles, are where the functions of these proteins, such as RNA processing, occur.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“When these interactions go awry, the proteins transition out of the droplet phase and form solid clumps,” Bowen said. “These proteins aggregates have been found to be toxic to the cells. Depending on the type of cell, this process may cause cell death.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">                                         </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fawzi’s study focuses on one of the proteins that is mutated during disease. Using computer simulations and analysis based on radio waves, the study demonstrated how small changes in the amino acid sequence of this protein could result in an increased propensity for the proteins to aggregate and form solid clumps that may damage the cells.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The computer simulation component of the study was led by Jeetain Mittal, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Lehigh University.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mittal and his team have been comparing the data produced by his models to the data obtained from the experiments, trying “to see if these models can be trusted to the point where they can be used confidently,” he said. “Computer modeling can allow us to represent the dynamic structure of the proteins and can, when accurately represented, give us a more detailed view of the structures,” Mittal said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Using similar techniques, studies have also demonstrated that particle-level processes could alter the propensity of proteins to form droplets. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“By studying these different interactions, we can attempt to understand the underlying causes of the disease, and ultimately, if we can understand the cause, we can develop a drug or process that can prevent aggregation,” Bowen said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“While this research doesn’t directly lead to treatment, we are hoping that our insights can tell us how the proteins behave, and what we can do to change this behavior. This can be useful for testing ideas and treatments in the future,” Fawzi said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A drug previously used for treatment of skin growths has been found to help prevent the development of certain skin cancers, according to a new clinical trial in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Led by Martin Weinstock, professor of dermatology and epidemiology at the Alpert Medical School, the trial examined patients from Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country and found that a course of fluorouracil 5 percent (5-FU) cream substantially reduced the risk of developing one type of skin cancer — making 5-FU the first drug known to continue to prevent squamous cell carcinoma after the duration of its course. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Here, for the 5-FU, it’s one course for two to four weeks, and then a year’s worth of risk reduction,” Weinstock said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Weinstock, 5-FU has been used for decades in order to treat a specific kind of growths. While not cancerous, these sun-induced skin growths can evolve into cancerous squamous cell carcinomas if not treated.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Being a chemotherapy medication, 5-FU likely works by inhibiting cancer cells from growing on the skin, said Christopher Dimarco, assistant professor of dermatology at the Med School, in a statement to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was natural to see whether this medication could be effective in preventing skin cancers,” Weinstock said, adding that research into skin cancers has been a career goal of his.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The patients involved in the trial were considered “high-risk” since they were veterans who had two or more of the cancers in question on the face or ears prior to beginning the course, said Julia Siegel, a resident who worked as a Dermatoepidemiology Research Fellow during the study. Of those studied — 932 patients from 12 VA medical centers across the country — the majority were elderly Caucasian men, a group that tends to develop skin cancers at high rates, Siegel said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The trial focused on two forms of skin cancer, namely basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. Researchers were hopeful that the drug would help prevent both, Weinstock said. But while the results showed a marked 75 percent reduction in risk for squamous cell carcinoma, the reduction for basal cell carcinoma was not significant.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This distinction is not surprising because, while certain growths commonly treated with 5-FU have been shown to be precursors to squamous cell carcinoma, less is known about their relationship with basal cell carcinoma, Siegel said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the first- and second-most prevalent forms of skin cancer respectively, Dimarco said. They are estimated to account for 75 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States, he added, but this statistic isn’t tracked by national databases and comes from insurance data.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both Weinstock and Siegel emphasized the trial’s importance to future treatments. “It’s such an exciting finding because it could save people from these surgeries and from the stress and worry that comes from having these skin cancers,” Siegel said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It means we have a good starting point and another option now, but we still have a ways to go to prevent squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma,” Dimarco said. “We need to study it more to optimize the treatment.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Weinstock, the number of reported cases of these cancers has dramatically increased during recent years, and now reaches upwards of five million in the United States. “One of my goals has been to turn that around,” Weinstock said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Weinstock, Siegel and Dimarco all noted the importance of sunscreen use in preventing skin cancers. Dimarco pointed to a study which found that sunscreen use reduced the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma by up to 40 percent.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Even before most students had returned to campus following winter break, Metcalf Auditorium filled last Thursday and Friday as students and faculty attended “Beyond Deep Learning,” a workshop designed to showcase interdisciplinary perspectives on artificial intelligence and its future.</p>
<p class="p2">Artificial intelligence is a means of enabling computers “to solve tasks in ways that usually resemble human intelligence,” said Michael Frank, professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences. Deep learning, a subfield of AI, is inspired by the biology of neurons in the human brain and designed to solve various problems, Frank said. These networks are used in technology that is becoming increasingly common. For example, Google Translate implements deep neural networks to translate between languages,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>while Tesla cars use the technology to detect pedestrians and signs in the road, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Stephanie Jones, associate professor of neuroscience, said deep learning can also be used for health applications such as categorizing data sets to determine if a patient has cancer.</p>
<p class="p2">While deep learning has led to a number of breakthroughs in recent years, the technique is nowhere near the level of intelligence of the human brain, said Thomas Serre, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences. The workshop was organized by Serre along with members of his lab and brought together researchers from computer science, engineering and cognitive science to work toward the next generation of AI. Attendees hoped to gain insight from biological mechanisms to create better algorithms. The team decided to organize the event based on their work, which seeks to “reverse-engineer the visual system” using knowledge pulled from biology, he explained.</p>
<p class="p2">The workshop featured a series of keynote presentations from University faculty as well as other leading scientists in the field. After the talks, participants from different departments broke into small groups to debate the topics raised. These discussions, along with the public presentations, addressed both the successes and limitations of deep learning, Frank said, adding that hearing world experts present their research showed why it may be necessary to take new approaches to AI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The workshop was a chance to “start the conversation about how we might integrate our efforts to make machines better and also learn something about the human brain,” Jones said.</p>
<p class="p2">“Beyond Deep Learning” was organized as a culmination to Serre’s Wintersession class, CLPS 1950: “Deep Learning in Brains, Minds and Machines.” On the last two days of the course, undergraduate students were exposed to experts working on different components of AI and gained the tools to “assess where the state of the art lies … (and determine AI’s)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>strengths and weaknesses,” Serre said. While progress in AI is significant and substantial, it is often “overhyped” in the media, especially as the topic has been the focus of many startups, he added. Instead, Serre intended to expose his students to the reality of the field through first-hand experience. Serre’s undergraduate students were engaged, asking more than half of the questions during the question-and-answer sessions following the lectures, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">The conference will pick up again in April with four new speakers to continue the discussions started last week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A sixth, largely unexplored layer in the cortex was the focus of a recent study by Brown University neuroscientists. The work provides new insight into how the cortex and thalamus communicate about sensation.</p>
<p class="p2">The thalamus is a sensory switchboard responsible for relaying information to other areas, according to the Huntington’s Outreach Research Project at Stanford University.</p>
<p class="p2">The cortex is “at the top of the brain — literally, but also in a functional sense,” said Barry Connors, an author of the study and professor of neuroscience. It performs the most complex work on neural information, in charge of many abilities that distinguish people from other animals, including the processing of sensory information and memory creation, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">The findings, published in the journal Cell Reports, uncovered new communication circuits in the cortex.</p>
<p class="p2">For 50 years, neuroscientists have studied mouse whisker barrels, which are neural structures in the cortex that model how the mammalian brain receives sensory information.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Researchers at Brown discovered similar structures two layers beneath the mouse whisker barrels in mice. These structures, known as “infrabarrels,” were found in the sixth layer of the cortex and provide a better picture of the circuitry involved in sensation. They were also shown to have a role in cross-talk between the thalamus and the cortex. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The discovery explores a part of the brain that scientists previously knew “almost nothing” about, said Alison Barth, professor of biological sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, who was unaffiliated with the study. The study allows researchers to infer how information is processed in the layer from looking at the neuronal architecture, anatomical inputs and electrical properties, Barth said.</p>
<p class="p2">This new insight on brain circuitry in the cortex helps researchers better understand uniquely human abilities such as language processing and abstract thinking, as well as diseases such as epilepsy and schizophrenia, Connors said.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“By studying the basic circuitry of the brain and sensory systems, we then have a foundation for a better understanding for disease states in which sensory processing is disrupted or communication between cortex and thalamus is disrupted,” said Shane Crandall, lead author and a former Brown postdoctoral student who is currently an assistant professor at Michigan State University.</span></p>
<p class="p2">In general, findings from rodent studies can be applicable to humans, Connors said. While people don’t have barrels in their brains, the details discovered about these structures can form a comprehensive model for areas that process visual or auditory information, or even decision-making and motor control, Barth said.</p>
<p class="p2">Scientists previously knew that the thalamus sent information to the cortex, where it was then processed and sent downstream. The study suggests that “the cortex not only receives information from the thalamus during sensation, but actually sends signals to the thalamus to control the amount of information coming back to the cortex,” Crandall said.</p>
<p class="p2">The researchers used “cutting-edge, molecular genetic techniques to very carefully isolate one set of neurons in layer six to understand how those neurons connect to each other and how they are connected to other parts of the brain,” Barth said.</p>
<p class="p2">Using genetically engineered mice that expressed fluorescent proteins, the researchers found that neurons located within the infrabarrels project from the cortex to the thalamus. They are located directly underneath mouse whisker barrels and arranged in similar structures.</p>
<p class="p2">Through optogenetics, a technique where specific neurons are activated or suppressed through pulses of visible light, the researchers found that neurons between the infrabarrels received strong input from the thalamus, though these neurons communicated mainly within the cortex.</p>
<p class="p2">“I like to think of neurons in the cerebral cortex as a high school lunchroom: There are hierarchies,” Barth said. Cells communicate, but some initiate conversation and others do not, she explained.</p>
<p class="p2">In future experiments, Connors and his team would like to understand why the cortex is talking back to the thalamus. Is it tuning that information — switching it on and off — or transferring it from one place to another? They would also like to address where the cells extend to and how they communicate with each other.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A group of University engineers and chemists, led by principal investigators Assistant Professor of Chemistry Brenda Rubenstein ’07 and Assistant Professor of Engineering Jacob Rosenstein ’05, has received a $4.1 million award to analyze new ways to store data using synthetic molecules. The research team has already used 25 unique synthetic molecules to encode and retrieve an 81-bit image and plans to scale up its project with the grant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By using mass spectrometry, Ugi reactions and liquid mechanic robotics, the team aims to make molecular data storage an efficient reality.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The primary advantage (of molecular storage) is that molecules are much denser — you can store them in a 3D volume,” Rubenstein said. “There’s much more information you can store in a much smaller volume.” She added that small molecules are easier to synthesize and model. The team will use Ugi reactions, which combine four components, to synthesize these molecules.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team plans to complete all of the basic studies in three years, after which they will begin focusing on key aspects of the project, Rubenstein said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The group’s research could have far-reaching implications as</span><span class="s3"> “everybody is producing a ton of data … more data than we know how to efficiently manage. There are a lot of people interested in alternative ways of storing and processing large amounts of data,” Rubenstein said. Today’s data is stored in two dimensions, but in a test tube it would be stored in three dimensions. Doing so would help search through large data sets much faster, he added. “We are going to make a hard drive in a test tube.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Data storage as it exists today also relies heavily on magnetism, said Nick Chilton, a research fellow at the University of Manchester who is unaffiliated with the project. It was first identified that single molecules could implement magnetism to store data in 1993. “We’re in a bit of a new era where molecules are actually looking like it’s a feasible possibility to do these kinds of applications,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Senior Lecturer David Mills at the University of Manchester, who is unaffiliated with the project, spoke on the work of synthetic chemistry as a whole. Chemists have a list of molecules they are interested in designing and have recently begun working to bring them to fruition. “From a synthetic chemist’s point of view, it’s making quite beautiful molecules,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rosenstein said that he appreciates the interdisciplinary nature of the project. “This is really an interesting project because it combines computing, data and information and chemistry. … It’s using chemistry to do the information processing.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I think this project is special to Brown. … Rosenstein and I (were) both Brown undergrads. … Here, you can readily knock on anybody’s door,” Rubenstein said. “That’s really what got this started. … It didn’t matter some of us were in chemistry and some of us were in engineering.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b>Enzyme shown to regulate inflammation, metabolism in fat tissue </b></p>
<p class="p3">A study conducted by researchers at the University identified an enzyme, SNRK, that could play a role in combating obesity in humans, according to a University press release.</p>
<p class="p3">The study focused closely on the two primary sources of fat in the human body: white and brown fat tissue. White fat, which is linked to obesity, stores excess calories while brown fat burns calories to produce heat. SNRK alters the physiology of fat tissue in mice, reducing inflammation in white fat cells and increasing the metabolism of brown fat cells.</p>
<p class="p3">Researchers bred mice without the gene that produces SNRK and compared their fat tissue to that of normal mice. They found that mice lacking the SNRK enzyme had a “higher concentration of microphages” — immune cells used as markers for inflammation — in their white fat tissue than normal mice. The mice lacking the SNRK enzyme were also heavier and had a lower metabolic rate, indicating that the absence of SNRK affected the functioning of brown fat.</p>
<p class="p3">Researchers then examined SNRK’s effect on humans, studying a group of 12,000 women. They found that mutations in the “genes responsible for SNRK production … were directly associated with higher body mass index” and risk of obesity. The study, which was led by Jie Li, a research associate in epidemiology at Brown, and Bin Feng, a research associate in epidemiology at the Alpert Medical School, was published in the academic journal “Diabetes.”</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Virtual reality used to control robots</b></p>
<p class="p3">A new study led by a team of undergraduate and graduate students allows users to control robots in virtual reality. Researchers hope the technology will be used to control robots remotely from large distances, bringing users directly into the surroundings of the robot.</p>
<p class="p3">Robots are particularly useful in environments that are not accessible to humans, such as distant planets and dangerous war zones. Today’s technology allows operators to see the robot’s surroundings using normal camera software, but controllers will now be able to fully immerse themselves in a robot’s environment using the team’s new techniques.</p>
<p class="p3">An HTC vive virtual reality headset controlled the robot located in the Humans to Robots lab, headed by Assistant Professor of Computer Science Stefanie Tellex. Furthermore, the team was able to control a robot located in Cambridge, Massachusetts over 41 miles away.</p>
<p class="p3">In the future, researchers hope to move the robot in more complex ways, including navigating it around an environment rather than just moving it in a predefined manner. The study was led by David Whitney GS and Eric Rosen ’18.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Clay minerals on Mars may have formed in primordial steam bath</b></p>
<p class="p3">Researchers questioned the early history of Mars by suggesting that the planet’s clay minerals formed during the creation of Martian crust long before the appearance of water, according to a University press release.</p>
<p class="p3">Previously, scientists believed that the presence of phyllosilicates, or clays, on Mars’ surface meant that the planet possessed sustained “surface water, groundwater or active hydrothermal systems” at some point in its history, according to the press release. However, Brown researchers propose that a molten magma ocean, which once existed on Mars’s surface, played a critical role in creating the clays. As this ocean began to cool and solidify, water and other substances might have been be pushed to the surface, “forming a thick, steamy atmosphere surrounding the planet,” according to the press release. This, in turn, would have converted the newly solidified surface into clay.</p>
<p class="p3">Kevin Cannon GS, who led the study, said the resulting atmosphere “would have been the hottest and wettest Mars ever was,” the perfect climate to create large deposits of clay. To test their hypothesis, researchers examined rock samples similar to Martian basalt in a high pressure device simulating the temperature and atmospheric conditions present on Mars as its magma ocean disappeared. After cooking the samples in the device, researchers found the rocks to be completely transformed, according to the press release.</p>
<p class="p3">While researchers cannot prove conclusively that their scenario occurred on Mars, their labs and experimentations support a strong hypothesis that could be further tested through Mars exploration, according to the press release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that mammogram screenings have increased in the two years after the Affordable Care Act eliminated cost sharing, or out-of-pocket payments. The study also examined the impact of this change on different demographics.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The idea of eliminating copayments and making these services free is that more people would receive recommended services, but we had limited evidence as to whether that has actually happened,” said Amal Trivedi, lead author and associate professor of health services, policy and practice.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study compared the number of mammogram screenings in the two years prior to the mandate to the number in the two years after it. Among people in Medicare Advantage Plans that eliminated copayments for mammograms, screening rates rose by about 6 percent, Trivedi said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Although (6 percent) may look like a small number, if you translate this to the number of women who are eligible to receive mammography, it is still a large number in terms of thousands more,” said Orestis Panagiotou, co-author and assistant professor of health services, policy and practice.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The results show that the elimination of cost sharing as part of the ACA is an effective strategy for increasing use of recommended preventative services such as breast cancer screening,” said Bryan Leyva MD’18, co-author and a medical student.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“More women received recommended breast cancer screening after the ACA eliminated copayments,” Trivedi said. “This is good for public health because we have compelling evidence that receiving recommended screenings reduces mortality from breast cancer.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study also compared the changes in number of mammogram screenings among different demographics. “We found that women who lived in areas with lower education and also Hispanic women did not increase their use of screening mammography as much as women did in areas with higher education and white women. This suggests that there is a need to have more outreach to women with lower socioeconomic status, as well as Hispanic women, to make sure that they are aware of the important provisions of the Affordable Care Act and can benefit from these services to the same degree as other women,” Trivedi said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As for the implications of this research, Panagiotou said that while it is still too early to say what concrete impacts there will be, follow-up data will help track how health care policies alter mammogram screening rates going forward. These policies may one day be transferable to increase the usage of other beneficial services, Panagiotou said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Leyva also brought up the impact of future policy on the results that have been observed. “Any policy that attempts to get rid of these provisions of the ACA may result in less use of this recommended service,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Although there has been an increase in screening rates, Trivedi said that they remain suboptimal. “There are other costs associated with a screening that can be substantial and can be a barrier to receiving screening,” Trivedi said. These costs could include having access to a source of care, as well as the out-of-pocket costs that would arise if a screening produces false positives and demands further tests.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Patients shouldn’t have to pay for things that are proven to be beneficial,” which is why it’s important to look into these kinds of policies and examine their outcomes in retrospect, Panagiotou said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In my opinion, it is a tragedy that there are women dying from late-stage breast cancers that could be prevented with appropriate screening and follow-up care,” Leyva said. “Policies have an important role to play in promoting or deterring use of recommended tests.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">The integration of man and machine may seem like science fiction, but the well-funded scientific movement aiming to restore functional independence to patients through the integration of computers is already a reality. A recent University study as part of the BrainGate2 clinical trial builds on this movement and improves the calibration system between brain and machine.</p>
<p class="p4">For those with conditions like ALS, brain stem stroke or limb loss, movements that many take for granted can be extremely difficult or even impossible. Brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, aim to help those with such ailments by translating brain cell signaling into the click of a cursor, the selection of letters on a screen or even the movement of robotic limbs.</p>
<p class="p4">One of the challenges involved in the real-time translation of brain activity is syncing an external device to align with the signals of the brain. This complex calibration process involves machine learning —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a set of elaborate algorithms — and often a technician, but the recent University study has sped things up.</p>
<p class="p4">The team studied two fundamentally different methods of decoding neural signals from a small device implanted directly into the brain, hoping to test the calibration process across each method. Using these decoding algorithms, all three participants gained full control of a computer cursor in under three minutes. One participant imagined moving a joystick in his mind and shaved almost two and a half minutes off of the typical calibration time.</p>
<p class="p4">Previous calibration processes — which have to occur frequently as neural signals change over time — have taken subjects anywhere from 11 to 20 minutes and have required patients to focus intensely while working with a technician, said Leigh Hochberg, professor of engineering and an author of the study.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“One of the things that I was really interested in with my research was trying to reduce the amount of active intervention required from a technician to get this system to work,” said David Brandman,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>neuroengineering postdoctoral fellow and the lead author of the study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This development makes it easier for patients to use the device on their own.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“To my knowledge, this is the first time where somebody has tried to quantify how quickly someone can learn to use a BCI across multiple people and novel users,” said Jennifer Collinger, assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh, who was unaffiliated with the study. She added that because neural signals can change over time, adjustments can be less burdensome with the rapid calibration times introduced by this study.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Eventually, the field may be rife with computer algorithms with the capability to recalibrate on their own. A BrainGate study in 2015 showed this technology is indeed possible, making BCIs usable after just one calibration process. “That’s something that the field is really pushing for — algorithms that can handle a self-recalibration process so that with these devices, calibration never has to be done again, at least in a supervised fashion,” said Steven Chase, associate professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University studying BCIs, who was unaffiliated with the study. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Another advancement in the field may come in the form of wireless devices that can seamlessly communicate with a robotic arm or computer cursor. “Ultimately, we’d like to move to a point where individuals with paralysis have a fully embedded, wireless system that worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week without the requirement of a technician … which would allow people to gain functional independence,” Brandman said.</p>
<p class="p4">While the study is promising, subjects have to undergo invasive brain surgery in order to implant a recording array like the one used in the University study. “Essentially, scar tissue builds up around the array and it pushes the neurons away from the tips of the electrodes. … Over time, you lose the ability to record from individual neurons,” Chase said. At the moment, this problem is “the single largest problem keeping these devices from going into widespread clinical use.”</p>
<p class="p4">These drawbacks have spurred a growing movement to use noninvasive recorders, which aim to gather as much brain activity as devices placed directly into the tissue. But the array in the study, according to Hochberg, “is the best clinically-cleared device … available today.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">University researchers have developed computational methods using a supercomputer that enables them to dive deep inside sickle cells and analyze their molecular characteristics. By modeling the processes responsible for sickle cell formation, the team will be able to explore possible treatments for the disease.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sickle cell anemia is caused by a genetic mutation that makes normally concave, round red blood cells become stiff and misshapen, said George Karniadakis, professor of applied mathematics. Sickle cell was identified as the first molecular disease by Nobel laureate Linus Pauling in 1949. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pauling’s initial characterization was based on the behavior of hemoglobin, a molecule normally distributed evenly throughout the red blood cell. In an infected individual, the molecule “will self-assemble into a fiber, and this fiber will push the red blood cell into a sickle shape,” said Lu Lu GS, the study’s first author and a member of Karniadakis’ research group. These fibers are rigid and behave similarly to the fibers in a plant stem, said Gregory Kato, professor of medicine and director of the Sickle Cell Center of Excellence at the University of Pittsburgh. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the cells affected by the disease are often thought of as sickle-shaped, there are dozens of abnormal shapes they can also take, Karniadakis said. The presence of these abnormal red blood cells in the body catalyzes a sort of “crisis.” Unable to easily pass through thin vesicles and capillaries, hemoglobin cannot transfer oxygen everywhere it needs to go. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study, led by Karniadakis and published in the Biophysical Journal, attempts to model hemoglobin fiber formation — a topic first discussed 30 to 50 years ago, but has since been relatively neglected in the field, Kato said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Today, the availability of supercomputer technologies makes the team’s study so unique. “They allowed for a new level of detail of molecular interaction … that has never been possible before,” Kato said. The study also stands out for its interdisciplinary approach to medicine, as it brought together mathematicians, engineers and physicians in an effort to learn more about sickle cell anemia, Karniadakis said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mapping the previously elusive process of fiber formation is an “expensive” computational problem, Karniadakis said. The problem’s complexity stems from the multi-scale approach necessary to consider both the microscopic and macroscopic implications of sickle cell anemia. The process “is more complex than most protein interactions. … There’s a lot of action going on,” Kato explained. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Creating an accurate computational model required the use of the Titan supercomputer located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, as well as other facilities, and a smaller-scale system on campus at the Center for Computers and Visualization. The supercomputer is the fastest of its kind in the United States and the fourth most powerful in the world, according to the bi-annual Top500 Supercomputer ranking released in June 2017.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The research provides insight on drugs currently being tested to treat sickle cell anemia. From the late 1990s until mid-2017, only one drug, Hydroxyurea, was FDA-approved to treat the disease. The drug works to soften sickled red blood cells and increase their elasticity, allowing the cells to more feasibly pass through the thin channels they would otherwise block, Karniadakis explained. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, a new treatment, Endari, was approved to treat sickle cell last year. There are still more drugs in the process of being tested and analyzed, Lu said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team hopes to use their research to test the different effects of the drugs, he added. This computational model will enable researchers to ask questions “that you wouldn’t be able to ask in the laboratory and certainly not with real patients” and predict drug outcomes before requiring specialized resources, Karniadakis explained. With “the mathematical model, … we don’t have to wait for someone to give a blood sample,” Kato said. “We can just think of the experiment and plug it into the computer and get a simulated answer.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> In the future, the team hopes to gain insight into cell-to-cell interactions as well. Karniadakis “already has advanced computational understanding to know how to do all these things,” Kato said. “It will just take time and effort.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Daniel Kunin’s ’17 statistical visualization project “Seeing Theory” has recently garnered attention from students, schools and educators. Working alongside Tyler Devlin ’17, Daniel Xiang ’17 and Rhode Island School of Design graduate Jingru Guo, Kunin created visually stunning representations of statistical concepts ranging from probability to inference. The website uses real world examples to supplement classroom learning. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kunin was paired with Guo for the final project in a web applications class at Brown, and together, the team created the first version of “Seeing Theory.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The (original) goal was to make these interactive visualizations that could contextualize the concepts in an intro stats course,” Kunin said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“All the (previous) resources seemed outdated, and I didn’t find any interactive visualizations,” Xiang said. “Current online education was plain text with no interaction.” After being accepted as a Royce Fellow to continue his work on the project, Kunin shared the team’s work with a few data scientists and math bloggers, one of whom tweeted about it. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The project went viral.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since its launch, “Seeing Theory” has morphed from just a supplementary resource into more of an online living textbook, Kunin said. “We expanded the written content massively,” he added. “We’re providing a more detailed written context to each visualization. We’ve also added a whole new chapter on Bayesian inference, and also altered many of the visualizations.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Xiang was enthused about the clarity of the explanations “Seeing Theory” offers, considering the complicated subject matter, he said. “Everything is in a concise little bite-sized module, and that is really approachable.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With a RISD background, Guo brought “a whole new perspective on design” to the project that the rest of the team did not possess, Kunin said. The project has helped launch her design career, teaching her how to build a product from scratch using modern design tools, Guo added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Xiang joined the project following Kunin’s initial work with Guo, and they discussed expanding their team to include Devlin. “We got together at New Baja’s and just sat there for two hours talking about the project,” he said. “I thought (the project) would be a good way to solidify all these topics I had picked up from undergrad.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kunin sees the development of “Seeing Theory” coming to a close in the near future. The team hopes to tackle some final bugs before volunteers take over to translate the website into Italian, Chinese, Polish and a number of other languages, he said. “We’ll get to a point when we are satisfied with the results, (and) then we’ll just let it become a resource on the internet.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Working on any project, it’s always hard to say this is a place where I can finish.” Guo said. “There’s always a balance between finishing and perfection.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Xiang hopes that the project will be incorporated into classrooms to help visual learners, though it is not intended to fully replace a first-year statistics education. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Aesthetics is a very important part of learning,” Kunin said. “Math especially; for me, math is a very beautiful field and, for some students, the best way to teach math is to share that beautiful side of it.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A recent study shows a likely correlation between volcanic seismicity and lunar cycles before an upcoming eruption. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We were interested in investigating whether we could use the response of volcanic systems to tidal stresses to detect whether a volcano is in a critical state, or when it is about to erupt,” said Társilo Girona, a NASA postdoctoral fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and leader of the study. “These stresses vary with the relative positions of the moon, sun and earth, and from the study, we found that volcanoes are sensitive to tides related to the lunar cycles when they are about to act.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Ruapehu volcano in New Zealand was chosen as the subject of the study. Ruapehu is home to two ski resorts, and one of the main reasons it was chosen was because GNS Science, who supplied the data, had been studying it for over a decade in an attempt to ensure the safety of tourists on the volcano, said Christian Huber, co-author of the study and assistant professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The data provided by GNS Science was measured against a model of synthetic tidal signals linked to lunar cycles. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The correlation we are looking at is whether volcanic activity responds to fortnightly tides, which are related to lunar cycles,” Girona said. “Out of the 12 years of data, we didn’t find any type of correlation between the two except three months before the only eruption (in the time span). There was a very significant statistical correlation.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Prior to the study, there was no way to predict the eruption. “There were zero unrest signals, which is very troublesome because these eruptions can be very dangerous,” Huber said. Three months before the volcano erupted, its tremors synced with the tidal activity. If this correlation can be applied to more volcanoes, it can lead to greater eruption prediction capabilities, Huber added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The data was also able to predict false alarms. “There were times where the mountain was closed because of an anticipated eruption, but no eruption took place,” Huber said. “These were points where the correlation between volcanic activity and tidal waves was very low, which is also cool to see.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Girona and his team have already begun looking at other possible data sets to examine, hoping to produce similar results that could make these findings relevant in the future. The team is currently considering Costa Rica, the Philippines and Japan as possible locations for future studies, Huber said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the study’s replicability in other volcanoes remains to be seen, researchers agree that it has a great deal of potential for future use in eruption detection.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If it turns out that this detection could be used generally, meaning other volcanoes also show the same correlations, tides could be an incredible detector for eruptions,” said Baylor Fox-Kemper, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences.“It’s an interesting paper. To say that tidal forces are changing things other than whether or not we can go to the beach, that part is very cool.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">This past weekend, students, faculty and aerospace professionals gathered in Barus and Holley to participate in the tenth annual Space Horizons workshop. The event focused on the industry’s shift toward the private sector, a change that has become increasingly prevalent in recent years.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The workshop was designed to provide an informal setting for conversation and interaction with the audience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was also shorter than more traditional conferences, lasting only 24 hours, said Rick Fleeter, adjunct associate professor of engineering and organizer of the conference. The shorter time span ensures that the audience is constantly engaged and actively participating throughout the day, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The workshop included a series of keynote presentations from a wide array of speakers. “We try always to get a collision of different points of view,” Fleeter said, adding that the schedule included traditional scientists, a space policy professional and entrepreneurs with business models in asteroid mining and moon resources. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Each of them has a different trajectory in their business careers. However, they are all really relevant to what people might face in the industry,” said Isabel Torrón, Rhode Island School of Design student and the lead student organzier of Space Horizons 2018.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The freedom of the private sector allows space exploration to have a faster “turnover time,” Torrón said. Private corporations can avoid otherwise drawn out government approval processes. Commercial companies are also able to complete projects that would “traditionally cost millions of dollars” for much lower prices, she added, pointing to an on-campus example — Brown’s EQUiSat satellite, which will be launched later this year, as The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/13/engineering-undergraduates-launch-satellite-2018/">previously reported</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Student groups from both RISD and Brown made an appearance at the workshop. Brown Space Engineering presented on its work with the EQUiSat satellite, while the RISD Rover team spoke about its entrance into the annual NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge, which hopes to put a robot on Mars.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a RISD student and member of BSE, Torrón’s leadership in the event highlights its blend of science and design. She is currently working on developing a conceptual space station for her senior thesis and hopes that she can incorporate “design-based thinking” into the otherwise STEM-heavy field.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Space Horizons was started in November 2008 when Fleeter set out to change the way conferences in his field were held and received. “I was sort of a contrarian,” he said, commenting on his experience attending conferences before he became a professor at the University. Fleeter hoped to bring together scientists who were working in niche fields and were willing to shift away from more conventional ideas in the field, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I hope this conference serves as a way to network and meet other people,” Torrón said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This year’s workshop had the highest student registration the organizers had ever seen, Fleeter said. He believes that this year’s focus on private industry was especially well-timed as companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin gain popularity among students. “Students are interested in commerce, in startups … and space is just an interesting topic now when you have these high profile individuals … investing in space. It brings together those two things,” Fleeter said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tamara Rudic ’21 and Amanda Hinh ’21 are taking PHYS 0160: “Introduction to Relativity and Quantum Physics,” Hinh said, and the conference was an opportunity for them to learn more about the topic outside of the classroom. The workshop also allowed them to learn about the commercial side of space, Rudic added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Terahertz could be future of wireless communication, researchers say</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The frequency range found between microwave and infrared radiation could be a key player in the next generation of wireless communication. For the first time, University researchers have demonstrated that these “terahertz” frequencies can be reflected off walls and still transmit data precisely, an important early step in the development of this new technology.

Terahertz data links could increase data transfer by a factor of more than a thousand compared with existing wireless technology, said Daniel Mittleman, professor of engineering and senior author of the study, which was published in APL Photonics.

Terahertz communication occurs at frequencies above 95 gigahertz, said Jianjun Ma, postdoctoral research associate and co-author of the study. Its use offers dramatically faster transfer speeds than does current wireless technology such as Wi-Fi routers, which operate in the microwave range of only a few gigahertz, Ma said.

There are many obstacles to the widespread adoption of terahertz technology. Traditional microwaves broadcast in all directions from a transmitter, but terahertz signals must travel in a single direction, requiring the transmitter to point directly at the receiver, Mittleman said.

Furthermore, terahertz signals are unable to travel through or around objects that disrupt their line of sight. “We have to find a way to go around blockages,” Mittleman said.

Mittleman’s goal was to determine whether terahertz signals could bounce off walls in order to bypass disruptions while still transferring data accurately. To study this, Mittleman’s team set up devices capable of transmitting and receiving terahertz frequencies and then reflected the signals off walls of a variety of materials. They measured the number of “ones and zeroes” received and calculated the “bit-error-rate,” the number of incorrect transfers made per bits sent, Mittleman said. The researchers found that even bouncing the signal off two walls — around a corner in Barus and Holley — resulted in a bit-error-rate of one in a billion. “It’s way better than your phone actually does,” Mittleman said.

The researchers also tested the technology outdoors, a task that required a special license from the Federal Communications Commission. Any outdoors tests above 100 gigahertz require such a license to ensure they do not interfere with satellites, Mittleman said. He hopes the FCC will start paying more attention to terahertz technology.

Generating signals with enough power at terahertz frequencies poses another technical hurdle to its usage as a means of data communication. “We proved that even though it was reflected by the wall two times, we still had enough power to keep the data link,” Ma said.

It remains unclear how many bounces might be possible for a practical terahertz data link, Mittleman said, adding that this was a first demonstration and more research can be done to determine the technology’s limits.

Aside from being studied as a mode of wireless communication, terahertz waves have been examined for various other purposes, said Rajind Mendis, assistant research professor of engineering, who has studied the technology for nearly two decades.

According to Mendis, terahertz waves can penetrate certain substances, including cardboard, paper and ceramics. For this reason, they are used in detection of explosives and illicit drugs, food quality control, preservation of historical artwork and diagnoses of certain cancers, Mendis said.

Mendis believes that terahertz signals will eventually become part of the next generation of wireless data transfer. “It is inevitable that we are moving towards the terahertz range for communications,” Mendis said.

While higher-frequency radiation, such as X-rays, poses some risk to humans, terahertz waves are not harmful at all, Mendis said.

Mittleman is skeptical that terahertz-range frequencies could replace current 4G or future 5G cell networks, but he believes the technology could be used in many other cases. He envisioned someone stopping by a kiosk in an airport and being able to download a high-definition movie to their phone in a matter of seconds, or a data center using the technology to route data wirelessly.

Mittleman, Ma and Mendis all noted that with the interconnectedness of devices on the “Internet of Things,” the use of terahertz frequencies could prevent such devices from clogging existing wireless networks, making them faster.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Multinational enterprises have a lot to gain by treating their factory workers well, according to new research by Provost Richard Locke P’18 and his former student, Greg Distelhorst, now an assistant professor of global economics and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The study, published in the American Journal of Political Science, shows that on average, factories that enforce basic labor and environmental standards benefit from a $1.6 million increase in annual purchases.

Furthermore, when factories improved their compliance, their orders increased by an average of four percentage points, which roughly translates to $110,000.

These findings were especially “pronounced in the apparel sector,” which faces more social pressure from consumers to comply with labor and environmental standards than others, said Mark Anner, associate professor of labor and employment relationships at Pennsylvania State University, who is unaffiliated with the study.

“Activists can make it painful to be noncompliant,” Distelhorst told Phys.org.

Despite this correlation, there is a lack of incentives for factories to enforce such conditions, Locke said. “Many of the actors involved in the supply chain have mixed incentives,” he said. Most of “the governments and countries where many of these companies are located … have really terrific labor and environmental regulations, but they don’t enforce them.” Roughly 80 percent of the companies in their study were non-compliant.

Sometimes, a country avoids enforcement because it doesn’t have the resources to inspect factories, enforce the working age or hold companies accountable to the legal minimum wage. Other times, countries fear that enforcement will increase the cost of doing business and drive out buyers, Locke explained.

“We show that compliance does pay, but it may not pay enough. Maybe 4 percent is just not attractive enough of a benefit to bring factories up to that level of compliance,” Distelhorst said.

Locke and Distelhorst carried out the study by “rigorously analyzing a novel data set on export transactions and social compliance audits of over 2,000 supplier factories,” Anner said.

These audits are measures taken by companies to ensure that their suppliers adhere to a specific code of conduct, including labor and environmental regulations that often vary from country to country, Locke said. In these audits, outside inspectors visit factories, interview managers, review employees’ time cards, examine factory records and inspect factories for adherence to health and safety regulations, Distelhorst said.

The researchers obtained the data set from a global sourcing agent, which takes orders from companies and helps them identify and handle transactions with factories, Distelhorst explained. For some factories, such as Nike, obtaining records took years, Locke added.

Both Locke and Distelhorst wanted to “find ways to reconcile a world that’s, for better or for worse, dominated by market capitalism,” Distelhorst said. “That should not come at the expense of dangerous or abusive conditions of workers.”

Going forward, the researchers would like to know why the majority of factories remain non-compliant despite its demonstrated benefits.

For Locke, continuing his research and teaching is essential, even as provost. Though he balances his responsibilities “with great difficulty,” it’s “important for a university administrator to still have his fingers on the pulse of what universities are all about,” he said.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Diane Lipscombe to serve as president of Society of Neuroscience</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Diane Lipscombe, director of the Brown Institute for Brain Science and professor of neuroscience, will begin her term as president of the Society for Neuroscience in November 2018. She will succeed Richard Huganir, who has served as president since November 2017.

The Society for Neuroscience has nearly 38,000 members from 90 countries. The group primarily aims to advance discoveries in neuroscience that benefit society, Lipscombe said, adding that the other goals of the organization are to “understand the value of basic research, translational research and clinical research (while continuing) to bring young scientists into the field.” As president, Lipscombe will advocate for scientific funding and organize the society’s annual meeting for over 30,000 people, among other responsibilities.

Lipscombe began studying biology after high school when she started working as a technician for a pharmaceutical company under the mentorship of Sir James Black, who would later go on to win the Nobel Prize in Medicine. The first person in her immediate family to attend college, Lipscombe now runs a major institute at the University that focuses on “advancing discoveries in brain science and engaging the community at Brown.” The institute recently organized a project focusing on gene suppressors in Lou Gehrig’s disease. It also houses the BrainGate group, which seeks to assist human-computer interaction.

Chris Moore, associate director of BIBS and professor of neuroscience lauded Lipscombe’s work in her current position. “She was really crucial in taking our (neuroscience) graduate program to the next level, and that only happens when people truly care deeply about educating students but also about them (personally).”

Lipscombe has served on volunteer committees within the Society for Neuroscience and has worked with the group to create its open-access scientific journal, eNeuro. As president-elect, she serves on the group’s executive committee alongside current president Huganir and former president Eric Nestler.

Moore thinks that Lipscombe will do well in her new position, adding that she can both navigate the political scene in Washington and lead those within the organization with ease.

Kristin Webster PhD’15, a former graduate student in Lipscombe’s lab, said that Lipscombe will be a “fantastic president,” adding that “she’s always been a strong advocate for women in science, …  underrepresented populations and … more scientific funding.”

Juggling these two demanding executive positions will be manageable with the help of “incredible” faculty around her, Lipscombe said. “I see these two positions as being incredibly synergistic. … Much of what I do here at Brown is very similar to the activities (at the Society for Neuroscience) with a different subset of people.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Funded by a grant of up to $19 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the University will lead an international team of scientists to create an implantable wireless brain interface system. The project aims to develop a system able to record neural activity at an unprecedented level for potential medical applications.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’re trying to build better ways of interfacing computers to the human brain so that we can help restore lost movement for people who have an injury, or lost vision or hearing,” said Lawrence Larson, dean of engineering and co-investigator of the project. “To do this, we have to be able to track the activity of many regions in the brain.”</p>
<p class="p2">The funding is coming from DARPA’s Neural Engineering System Design program, which aims to develop interfaces that allow “data transfer between the brain and electronics” and which may one day become “capable of mitigating the effects of injury and disease,” according to its website.</p>
<p class="p2">In addition to members of the University, the team includes researchers from the University of California at San Diego, the University of California at Berkeley, Massachusetts General Hospital, Stanford University, Qualcomm, the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering and IMEC, an international research group based in Belgium.</p>
<p class="p2">The funding will be distributed to the team over four years. “At the end of the four years, our goal is to have functional, implantable procedures and devices that have been tested in animals and (are) ready to go through FDA testing, so that (they) can used in humans,” said Farah Laiswalla, a senior research associate in engineering at the University.</p>
<p class="p2">Laiwalla also mentioned the unprecedented scale of this project, in terms of the large scope of the brain that is being analyzed. “What is novel about this project is that instead of building a single, monolithic implant, which is something that we’ve done in the past, (it) is trying to build a distributed network, almost like an internet type of network approach to implants in the brain,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">One of the key parts of this project is the development of very small, wireless devices the researchers call neurograins. “These tiny sensors have all the electronics you need and their own wireless link. We plan to put hundreds of thousands of these into the brain,” Laiwalla said.</p>
<p class="p2">The wireless system will be able to both record and stimulate neural activity through electrical signals, according to a University press release. This will allow researchers to better understand how the brain reads signals from the world. Researchers hope that this knowledge may one day be applied for medical purposes.</p>
<p class="p2">“We can transmit data from the outside world into the neurograins that stimulate the neurons. That could potentially project sound or image to those who are deaf or blind,” said Vincent Leung, technical director of the Circuits Labs at UC San Diego, where some of the project’s technologies will be tested. The process could also “potentially help a paralyzed person move their prosthetic arms just by thinking. This is the bidirectional communication that is an important part of this project.”</p>
<p class="p2">“This project is very ambitious,” Larson said. This grant allows researchers from many different countries and disciplines to work together to better understand singaling activity in the brain, potentially changing the lives of millions of people in the world who have lost limbs. “We hope that this technology will enable this to happen in the future, and we hope that we, through this project, will have had made a significant step forward for these healing types of applications,” Larson added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once a military and scientific research base in Greenland during the 1960s, Camp Century is now abandoned with all of its wastes — including chemical, radiological and physical — left frozen, presumably for eternity. But with temperatures rising in northern environments, there is concern of remobilization of the wastes, spelling complications for who is responsible for the removal and how it will affect the surrounding environment. A study that includes a University researcher examined the potential implications this has for the environment and diplomacy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">While the base “never had nuclear weapons on the site,” the scientists did have a nuclear “test reactor … to see how it would react in that cold of an environment,” said Joseph MacGregor, co-author of the study and deputy project scientist at NASA’s Operation IceBridge. The reactor was removed, so the true concerns are the wastes that were left behind, MacGregor added. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The major concern, based on current research, is that the toxic compounds known as PCBs being released at the base are “problematic for animal and human health,” said Jeff Colgan, co-author of the study and associate professor of political science and international studies. According to the study, “persistent organic pollutants, including PCBs, are one of three broad classes of chemical toxins of global significance.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While these chemicals are of definite concern to the researchers, there are currently no civilizations or animals relatively close by. “The area is quite isolated, and the issue is that the PCBs will get into the water and trickle out into the ocean water that is nearby,” Colgansaid. This makes the issue more global, affecting the larger environment over time, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Right now, it’s still cold enough that far inland that you don’t really get much melt at all, and the snow just builds up year after year,” explained Mike MacFerrin, postdoctoral research associate at the University of Colorado and co-author of the study. However, “by about 2090, give or take, the amount of melting will exceed the amount of snowfall,” and the chemicals will be exposed to the environment, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Because of the site’s proximity to nuclear waste, it is the first time Deborah Gordon, director of the Energy and Climate Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and senior fellow in international and public affairs at the University,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>has seen climate change reveal problems publicly regarding a country’s political operations, specifically relating to nuclear development, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p2">MacGregor confirmed that addressing the waste leads to many “unresolved questions,” especially about “who ought to pay for this, what the cost may be and how quickly that it has to be addressed.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Potential conflict could arise because the site was a U.S. military base built as a result of a treaty with Denmark. But now with Greenland gaining far more independence, there is a strong question of who is responsible for the waste. “There is no easy way to clean it up,” and this leads to a “potential source of political conflict between the United States, Greenland and Denmark,” MacGregor said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Neither the (United States) nor Denmark has officially accepted responsibility at this point, and there is a legal treaty that seems to spell out responsibility, but like all legal treaties, especially old ones, there is a certain amount of ambiguity,” Colgan said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Gordon said nations should look beyond just single cases of expenditure because “you end up having societies that are having big costs — those actual physical costs and also social costs imposed on them.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">This issue will be a recurring problem over the next 90 years, as Camp Century is just one of many abandoned sites with probable pollutants waiting to be uncovered, MacFerrin said. The project that included Camp Century also involved three other sites, with some “already melted out, so the pollution is already on the surface, but there is a lot less of it, so it is less of a concern,” Colgan said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There are other sites on the coast of Greenland, some of which (are) operated by the United States, some by Denmark,” which have rusting drums of unknown materials still present, MacGregor said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Camp Century’s earliest research was on ice and the environment and contributed to the understanding of impending climate change, MacGregor said, adding that he hopes more people will learn about the research that has come out of the sites but also the impeding issues they now face. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Camp Century is much more than just a military experiment and a declined military idea. It was also a significant scientific research outpost, and the amount of data they collected is huge and continues to this day,” MacGregor said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University researchers use drones to study forests, carbon cycle</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Loren Albert, one of four Voss postdoctoral research associates at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, is taking her research to new heights. Using drones to survey forests from above, Albert hopes to better understand carbon flows and photosynthesis on a large scale.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p4">A self-described “biologist at heart,” Albert started studying plants as an undergraduate at Reed College. She found it fascinating that she could measure a plant’s ability to take up carbon from the atmosphere on a “leaf level.” Albert “put a plant in a chamber, measure(d) the gases going in and gases going out” and estimated how much carbon was taken up by the leaves.</p>
<p class="p4">While earning her PhD at the University of Arizona, she measured the photosynthesis capabilities of individual trees in tropical forests, but one problem remained, Albert explained. “There’s an estimated 16,000 species in Amazonia, and I measured only around six.” Albert knew that this gap would never be closed with only individuals like her working on the ground, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">To address this issue, she has partnered with Jim Kellner, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. Kellner created the Brown Platform for Autonomous Remote Sensing, which built a drone to help the researchers observe forests on a much wider scale.</p>
<p class="p4">With the platform, the researchers have gained significant control over how and when their data is collected. For example, the team can now fly the drone over forests at times when they anticipate strong environmental stress to target data collection. This advantage provides researchers with dynamic information — they are able to “observe the system in short time scales in which the organism is reacting to the environment,” Kellner said. Essentially, “the system is living.”</p>
<p class="p4">Technological developments have aided researchers’ capacity to visualize carbon flows in forests and answer important questions regarding how plants facilitate the exchange of carbon from the atmosphere to the land, Kellner explained.</p>
<p class="p4">Though it is not possible to visually observe that flux, researchers may now use the drone to quantify solar-induced fluorescence, a glow that plants emit while getting rid of excess chemical energy. Researchers hope that glow analysis will inform future conclusions about the carbon cycle. <span class="s3">William Klimpert ’18, a former member of the Kellner Lab, said he often measures plants in the “hot sun” or on the roof of the Sciences Library for the fluorescence study.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Both Albert and Kellner said their project poses complicated biological, engineering and statistical challenges. The team has had to pull knowledge from a variety of academic disciplines in their research. But they stress their work measuring carbon flows is crucial given the role of forests in offsetting human emissions. A 2014 study conducted by NASA estimated that tropical forests absorb 1.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, roughly 56 percent of the total carbon absorbed across the world.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Albert has received valuable mentorship from Kellner, who strongly encouraged her to apply for the fellowship after seeing her give a talk at conference. Albert brings a different “body of knowledge” to his work, which inspires productive collaboration, Kellner said.</span></p>

		<title>Simple testing strips detect fentanyl drug in opioids</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The unknown presence of fentanyl — an opioid fifty times stronger than heroin — in many drugs has contributed to the increasingly fatal opioid crisis that has swept across the United States in recent years. A new study co-authored by Traci Green, adjunct associate professor of emergency medicine and epidemiology at the University, and Susan Sherman, professor of health, behavior and society at Johns Hopkins University, has shown that testing strips can be used to detect trace amounts of fentanyl. The compact and cost-effective strips can be easily distributed and are nearly 100 percent accurate. Their work will allow agencies across the country to implement these tests in the near future.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“People are dying,” Sherman said. “We wanted to understand the nature of these testing methods … (so) we could better (understand) what are the best ones to employ in the field.” The testing strips are especially advantageous due to their simplicity and low cost.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Drug checking can be helpful to start a conversation with an individual regarding safe drug use, Sherman said. “(The strip) brings us to a different kind of conversation about the reality of peoples’ drug use,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Expanding the use of the strips could benefit initial advancements in public health programs combating the epidemic. The majority of public health services are located in urban environments, but expanding harm reduction services to non-urban and younger populations is vital to reaching the shifting demographics of users, Green said. The strips will make it easier for agencies to reach people in these areas, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Although these strips can be seen as a means of initial treatment, their use is one of the last steps in the process. “It’s not all about treatment. Getting someone housing and getting their kids back, … that would go farther than getting people into treatment,” Sherman said. “The point is to keep them alive.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the strips test opioids and are meant to combat the epidemic, they may provide insight applicable to fighting future drug epidemics as well. “This could be really useful across the board for any drug supply. … If we indeed had a larger problem with another drug it would be a way to help us lose risk and increase health services,” Green said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Health agencies currently use other methods to check drug quality, including spectrometry, a method less sensitive than the strips but one that leads to a more detailed analysis, Green and Sherman said. However, spectrometry requires a physical space to conduct tests, while the strips are more mobile. While the strips were the most sensitive of the three forms of testing studied by Green and Sherman, they do not discern between analogs of fentanyl or analyze its concentration. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Drug checking is mainly conducted in Europe, but the strips were first piloted in Canada and in limited areas across the United States. Recently, California has bought thousands of the strips tested by Sherman and Green to use in their public health programs, Green said. The demographics of opioid users today are different from those who used the drugs many years ago. “Drug checking is one thing that could help us reach populations who perhaps haven’t been thinking about their risk of opioid use,” Green added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> Silvia Martins, associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who is unaffiliated with the study, said the epidemic started many years ago despite its recent attention. “The opioid epidemic started in the late 1990s and occurred in parallel with an increase of prescription opioid use in the (United States),” she said. Martins noticed little research and few papers about increasing opioid prescription and use and decided to enter this line of research in 2004. “People weren’t paying that much attention. … Once it began affecting suburban whites, it became a big issue. … Once it started affecting middle-class white people, it started gaining attention,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Alongside the recent implementation of the testing strips, places such as New York City, Seattle, Kentucky and others across the country are creating health campaigns and increasing training to raise awareness of opioid overdoses. In addition, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has partnered with physicians to monitor and alter prescription practices to limit opioid possession. “The next big step needs an intertwined solution at a different level, making sure that all major cities and suburban areas have these prevention programs,” Martins said. Furthermore, raising the awareness of family members and the general public to lessen the stigma of opioid overuse is necessary, alongside a data-driven, multi-pronged approach, she added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The process of creating “Toymaker” began when Nellie Robinson ’17, a Brown/RISD dual degree student with an interest in animation, wanted to work on a collaborative film project and pitched the idea to Meier in fall 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After Meier got on board, Robinson started to develop the story. “I started to think more about the style and feeling I wanted to convey first,” she said. “I wanted to convey an excitement about creating things, about creating fantasy worlds, about turning something everyday and mundane into something more magical, and from there, it was just a matter of what story would allow me to convey those feelings.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Working with other RISD students, Robinson developed concept art, the script and the storyboard to create the look of the film before the animation began fall 2016 in one of Meier’s animation classes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The film’s production — which divided responsibilities between members of the small team — involved animation, lighting and shadows control and a long rendering process, among other tasks.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The project took about a year from inception to completion and was created by the team “as if we were an actual small animation studio,” said Kenji Endo ’18, who led the group on modeling and set directing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Meier drew inspiration for this class structure from her own experience in the visual effects industry in Hollywood and from her work on integrating computer graphics into live-action movies. “I have a lot of professional experience doing production, so I modeled the class after that,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The film was selected for showing alongside 417 other films, 68 of which were student-produced. The festival will be held March 15-18, and films will be evaluated for prizes in various categories including shorts, student work, Greek films and experimental projects. The festival will screen works from over 50 countries.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The success of “Toymaker” has left Meier open to the idea of doing future long-term projects, but not alone. “I also need the group of students that is willing to put their heart and soul” into the project, she said.</span></p>
<strong><em>Correction: A previous version of this article stated a RISD the team is to present the short. In fact, Brown students were also involved in the process. The Herald regrets the error.</em></strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">A new study by led by George Konidaris, assistant professor of computer science, describes an algorithm to help robots plan intelligently by engaging in high-level tasks using low-level data. The study was supported by an award from the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/19/four-professors-awarded-darpa-directors-fellowship/">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>.</p>
<p class="p4">Artificial Intelligence researchers have been struggling to put together the idea of how robots could plan and understand abstract concepts. “The study is about connecting abstract cognitive states with physical states of the world,” explained Michael Littman, professor of computer science. “When we (humans) think about problem solving, we think about it in an abstract, conceptual space, and if we want robots to process ideas at a more complex level, they must be able to do the same.”</p>
<p class="p4">“Right now, robots are making decisions based on sensorimotor data, which is limited to low-level processing tasks,” Konidaris said. For example, if a human were to put on a jacket using only low-level processes, they would have to understand every movement necessary to reach for the jacket, process every muscle that needs to be contracted and position the jacket optimally. In these cases, programmers must dictate how the robots think about the world, which inhibits robots from acting and learning autonomously.</p>
<p class="p4">“The problem is that … low-level sensory data are confusing and hard to process, which makes long-term goal-based plans hard to achieve,” said Stefanie Tellex, assistant professor of computer science. Konidaris’ approach links the low-level data to high-level concepts, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">High-level processing would involve self-learning the methods necessary to complete a task without being explicitly instructed about every detail and would<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>require a fine-grained understanding of abstract concepts, Konidaris said. “What our work tries to do is to bridge the gap between these two types of processing and investigate how a robot can learn (these concepts) by simply interacting with objects in the world, just as we as humans do,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">The study was published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence and co-authored by Leslie Pack Kaelbling and Tomás Lozano-Peréz, professors of computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Together with Konidaris, they came up with an algorithm that allows for connections between low-level sensory data and higher-level processing. Now, when robots are provided with only motor skills, they will be able to identify and process images and tasks in the real world, Konidaris said.</p>
<p class="p4">The experimentation largely involved simulations and “lots of math” in the early stages, Konidaris added. Eventually, they were able to apply these algorithms to robots in a lab setting.</p>
<p class="p4">Being able to make robots engage in long-term, goal-based planning is “very exciting,” Tellex said. “It points robots towards a way of functioning that’s more autonomous and self-sufficient.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the midst of the Cold War, the Soviet Union and the United States competed in virtually every arena, each power vying for the political, economic and military advantage. Yet in 1976, the field of planetary science was united by the efforts of Professor of Geological Science Jim Head, who helped bridge the gap between the rivalling states. At the urging of then University President Howard Swearer and others, Head organized a joint conference between Brown, the Russian Space Research Institute and the Vernadsky Institute, hoping to share scientific progress between the two countries. The conference has continued every year since — even amidst current tension between the countries — and recently included China as well, holding annual sessions in both Moscow, Russia and Houston. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The conference is only one way that Head has connected scientists and inspired those in the field. In his more than four decades at the University, Head has closely collaborated with NASA, taught thousands in his classes and helped secure the role of science in the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Blasting off from Brown</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Following the completion of his undergraduate degree from Washington and Lee University, Head enrolled at Brown for graduate school. He was inspired by Professor Thomas Mutch to pursue planetary science, a field which was relatively unexplored and crucial during the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head found his first job after graduate school by chance, flipping through job openings in book. He stumbled upon a listing for NASA, which read, “Do you want to think your way to the moon and back?” Head helped select the moon landing sites for the Apollo missions and trained astronauts while there, earning him an Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal from the agency in 1971.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a few years at NASA, Head moved back to Brown in 1973 and became an assistant professor. Despite leaving NASA, Head maintained strong ties with the organization and continues to do so to this day. Every year, Head trains astronauts in geology — what he refers to as his introductory class — in the span of a few days to a week. Though the class is typically hosted in Houston, Head has brought the trainees to Brown and given them valuable lessons on College Hill.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head has stayed in touch with dozens of Russian and American scientists at space institutes and connected them to others at the University, some of whom have proven invaluable to research on campus. He brought John Mustard, professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences, on a trip to Russia early in his career, introducing him to scientists there and making connections that Mustard utilized for more than 20 years of research. “He’s really generous with his time and connections. He helps people get up the ladder,” Mustard said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head has also brought many prominent speakers to campus, including David Scott, a former astronaut for the Apollo missions, and Maria Zuber, vice president for research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Head’s former student. Greg Hirth, professor and chair of earth, environmental and planetary sciences, said that “There’s a high level of science that occurs because of his legacy in the department.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Continued Orbit</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head remains an active researcher and educator today. “He’s a rockstar scientist,” Mustard said. According to his Google Scholar page, he has co-authored more than 100 papers in the last four years alone on topics ranging from volcanoes on Venus to water on Mars. He advises and teaches graduate students every year, discussing topics including research in difficult climates such as Antarctica. Though the course will be taught by Mustard this fall, Head has taught GEOL 0050: “Mars, Moon and the Earth” for several years — by his estimate, about 6,000 undergraduates have completed the course.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Unofficially, he remains a steadfast leader within the department. Though they barely collaborate on research, Hirth said that he and Head regularly discuss new projects and ideas. Head is often the first one in the office in the morning — when Hirth arrives at 6:30, he is usually there already.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A visit to Head’s office reveals both his extensive history in the field and his personable character. He has collected dozens of trinkets and toys from his experience and always gives presents to children who visit him. Mustard’s six-year-old son rushes to Head’s office when visiting. “His first instinct is to go knock on his door,” Mustard said. Children have left thank you notes all over his office for gifts given throughout the years, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">More prominently, hundreds of craft beer bottles line the walls of his office. Head is a “beer connoisseur,” as described by Hirth, and will occasionally bring his own personal bottles to department events when the supply does not meet his standard.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Head has always and continues to advocate for scientific research. In addition to serving on national committees and lobbying on behalf of the scientific community, he’s a “great strategic thinker,” Mustard said, peppering questions upon faculty in the department and urging them to consider their work in a broader context.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A new tool developed by University researchers, dubbed SWIF(r), can identify certain genes in humans — ones that result from “adaptive mutations,” genetic differences which have spread amongst a population over time to become more common. The researchers applied their technology to genomic data from the ‡Khomani San people of southern Africa to identify adaptive mutations among the population associated with immunity and metabolism.</p>
<p class="p2">The name SWIF(r) stands for “sweep inference framework correlation,” ­where ‘r’ is the statistical notation used for denoting correlation, said Lauren Alpert Sugden, a postdoctoral fellow and member of the Ramachandran Lab, who led the study. The name alludes to the process of an adaptive mutation spreading across a population, known as a “selective sweep.”</p>
<p class="p2">“The idea is to be able to look at genomic data from people around the world today and to sort of infer the past: what mutations have been really beneficial for populations in adapting to different environments, different diets, different pathogens, that kind of thing,” Alpert Sugden said.</p>
<p class="p2">SWIF(r) offers a way of doing just that, by scanning different genomes and calculating the probability that a specific mutation is adaptive, Alpert Sugden said. The method can detect mutations that took place more than 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="p2">“As we did it, it just became very clear how powerful SWIF(r) is compared to existing methods,” said Sohini Ramachandran, associate professor of biology and computer science, director of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology and co-author of the study. Ramachandran’s lab and the CCMB use mathematical modeling and statistics to study genetic data.</p>
<p class="p2">Prior methods of detecting adaptive mutations involved scanning sequenced genomes and applying statistical models to identify genes that are outliers, said Brenna Henn, assistant professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University and co-author of the study. However, factors such as large reductions in population size or rapid growth can mimic signals of adaptive selection within a group of people even when the group is not undergoing natural selection, Henn said.</p>
<p class="p2">SWIF(r) improves upon these methods by accounting for the histories of the populations in question and giving an easy-to-interpret output that shows whether any given gene is adaptive, Henn said.</p>
<p class="p2">To test the efficacy of SWIF(r), the team analyzed genetic data Henn helped gather from the ‡Khomani San people. This group has the greatest genetic diversity of any living population and is thought to have lived in their current environment for a very long time, meaning they have a high chance for adaptations to arise and are likely already adapted to their current environment, Alpert Sugden said.</p>
<p class="p2">In running SWIF(r) on genetic data from the ‡Khomani San population, the researchers arrived at two key findings, according to Alpert Sugden. The first involved a collection of genes associated with immunity, called the Major Histocompatibility Complex. Researchers also found evidence in genes related to metabolism supporting the “Thrifty Gene Hypothesis,” which states that the ability to store as much energy as possible arose from food insecurity in hunter-gatherer populations.</p>
<p class="p2">The example of ‡Khomani San genetics was a great test case for SWIF(r), said Lorin Crawford, assistant professor of biostatistics, “because it kind of shows the breadth of what (SWIF(r)) could do.” Crawford believes the tool could be applied to many different sets of genetic data to locate adaptive mutations.</p>
<p class="p2">Ramachandran wants people to adapt the technology to expand its capabilities. “The F in SWIF(r) stands for ‘framework’ and so the goal is that it’s implemented very flexibly,” she said, adding that ideally the tool could be used on organisms other than humans.</p>
<p class="p2">The project began in 2014 and went through an extensive period of development and calibration. “These things always take a lot longer than you expect them to,” Alpert Sugden said.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s neat to see it out in the world,” Ramachandran said, adding that other researchers in the field have expressed interest in using the tool and collaborating with the team on new datasets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Lecture contemplates intersection of faith, science</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“There is something very dignified about (God) allowing the creativity of the Universe to be present within it and slowly emerge, rather than just putting everything in order from the beginning,” said Karin Öberg, a professor of astrochemistry at Harvard, during a lecture titled “Science and Theology of Habitable Worlds around Other Stars” on Monday.

Öberg’s lecture took place as the final event in the Brown-RISD Catholic Community’s Thomas Becket Association Lecture Series. The series allowed the University to host lecturers who spoke on the intersections of religion and a wide array of subject areas, such as law and science, said Reverend Albert Duggan ’03.

During her lecture, Öberg delved into the theological implications of ongoing research into habitable planets and the presence of extraterrestrial life. Öberg, whose research team discovered the first complex molecule on a disk of dust and gas that surrounds a newly formed star — stressed that “there is no intrinsic psychological conflict between being a Catholic and a scientist.”

Öberg began her lecture by explaining the variety of scientific and religious models that describe the Universe’s structure. Following the formulation of the Big Bang theory, which outlined the expansion of the Universe that causes galaxies to grow further apart from each other, religious individuals advanced an alternative hypothesis: Through miraculous creation, new matter was constantly formed in the Universe to fill the gaps between galaxies.

Rather, Öberg said she believes the discovery of the Universe’s constant expansion suggests that “we seem to have a god that sets things into motion but then lets the Universe emerge … following its own laws.” She added that this system represents a “joy in creation … and seeing something change over time.”

In addition to articulating the religious ramifications of the Big Bang theory, Öberg also explained scientific efforts to discover habitable planets and life throughout the Universe. In order to classify a planet as habitable, scientists determine the distance between the planet and its host star to calculate the sustainability of liquid water on the planet. Drawing on data from recent studies, Öberg said “water turns out to be an extremely common thing we see in space … (and) where planets are forming.” With the presence of water and organic materials, “there are many planets that are physically habitable,” she added.

But while researchers cannot conclude that the Universe is “teeming with life,” Öberg said she found “austere beauty” in the idea of “Earth sailing through time and space with all the life in it.”

Öberg spoke on how finding rational life outside Earth would challenge humanity’s relationship with God. To answer this question, she relied on the writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas, who discussed the possibility of multiple incarnations of God and Jesus Christ that could offer salvation to extraterrestrial beings.

Marjorie Pang ’18 said her Catholic faith and belief in the compatibility of science and religion brought her to the lecture. “It’s interesting to hear from someone who shares that view,” she said, adding that the discussion taught her that “science perfects God’s creations.”

In bringing Öberg to campus, Duggan said he hoped to reassure students that they do not need to choose between faith and interest in academia. “A person of faith can use their faith and theological understanding to enrich the research that they do and, likewise, … use the research that they do to encourage probing of theological questions,” he added.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Researchers reveal sex-based disparities in stroke risk</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Risk factors for stroke have a disproportionate effect on women compared to men, which may be due to a lack of effective treatment and preventive care, according to a University study published in the journal “Stroke” last month. The study aims to convince physicians to take sex into consideration when treating stroke patients, said Tracy Madsen, the study’s first author and assistant professor of emergency medicine.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A stroke is an event that involves damage to the brain or brain tissue caused by a disrupted flow of nutrients and oxygen to the brain, Madsen explained. The ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, caused by a clot in a blood vessel traveling to the brain, she added. The likelihood of experiencing a stroke may increase with hypertension, diabetes or atrial fibrillation, which consists of irregular heart rhythms, as well as other common afflictions, such as migraines, she said. Madsen’s recent study examined existing data, looking for all of these risk factors to highlight differences by sex.</span></p>
<p class="p2">This study was inspired by research Madsen published in the journal "Neurology" in August, which looked at rates of stroke occurrence over nearly two decades. It showed that while stroke incidence rates decreased in men over time, the same was not true for women, especially in the category of ischemic strokes. “That’s a concerning finding,” she said. “One of the obvious hypotheses … is maybe we are not preventing stroke in women as well.”</p>
<p class="p2">This discrepancy, she hypothesized, could be due to each sex needing different preventative strategies for certain risk factors. By using the same treatment and guidelines for men and women, “maybe we are missing out on better ways to prevent stroke in women," Madsen added.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Seana Gall, a senior research fellow in cardiovascular epidemiology at the Menzies Research Institute in Tasmania, Australia, has conducted similar research on sex specificity in strokes. Madsen’s study was significant because it addressed “gaps identified by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association in terms of what we know about preventing stroke in women,” given that the condition’s presence is increasing as a public health issue, Gall said. The study not only highlighted potential risk factors, but also looked into the management of these risk factors through a sex-specific lens. This enabled researchers to understand that women are less likely to take blood thinners — a common treatment for atrial fibrillation — than men and that they also experience differing forms of diabetes prevention, among other findings, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Madsen’s interest in the sex-specific nature of stroke developed over the course of her education as an undergraduate and medical student. After pursuing women's studies in college, she "fell in love with emergency medicine" and found that this research allowed her to pursue both simultaneously, Madsen said. One of her mentors at Brown, Alyson McGregor MD’03, associate professor of emergency medicine, helped her realize that her interest in women’s health could translate into a variety of medical specialties.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Though scientists have long noticed differences in rates of cardiovascular disease and stroke between sexes, the last decade has seen an increased focus on the issue, Gall said. The American Heart Association's “Go Red for Women” campaign is partly responsible for that, as it helped bring about the notion that “cardiovascular disease, including stroke, is a big part of the burden of disease in women” to the public eye, which brought more focus to it within the research world, she said. Recently, journals like “Stroke,” among others, have even started publishing editions dedicated solely to the topic, Gall added.</p>
<p class="p2">Madsen said her next steps include developing “sex-specific cut-offs for different risk factors,” which could lead to practical applications in a clinical setting. She said she hopes that, in the meantime, her study will serve as an educational tool for clinicians and act as further evidence that stroke is “not purely a man’s disease.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Scientists have long examined the dynamics of the ocean, and a recent study conducted by University researchers brings new insight into the properties of ocean turbulence. The results of the study have the potential to develop better models of ocean currents, which could consequently improve climate models.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study, which focused on how large-scale turbulence in the ocean dissipates energy, focused on the properties of eddies — a specific kind of turbulence flow. “Eddies are like spinning passes of fluid in the ocean,” said Brodie Pearson, postdoctoral researcher in earth, environmental and planetary sciences and co-author of the study. The size of these eddies can range from 10 to 100 kilometers wide, he said. The research focused on the properties of a particular kind of eddy — mesoscale eddies, the largest known type. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Though examining the energy dissipation of mesoscale eddies was the core of the study, this was not what the researchers initially intended to investigate, said Baylor Fox-Kemper, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences and co-author of the study. “(In) some studies, you find what you set out to look for, and (in) some studies you find something along the way that you realize is interesting and worth pointing out and maybe has a significance beyond what you were setting out to study,” he said. “This is in the latter category.”</p>
<p class="p4">The researchers initially aimed to evaluate a new change to high-resolution climate models by creating a series of tests to compare different models, Fox-Kemper said. “In the course of doing that, we noticed that one particular property — the energy dissipation rate — behaved, in a statistical sense, in a way we didn’t expect it to.”</p>
<p class="p4">The models indicated that the energy dissipation of mesoscale eddies followed a particular kind of statistical distribution, known as a lognormal distribution. In most statistical distributions, a typical measurement is close to the average, Fox-Kemper said. “What’s important about a lognormal distribution is that a typical measurement is very far away from the average,” he explained.</p>
<p class="p4">“It has been well-known that small-scale turbulence follows a lognormal distribution,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fox-Kemper said. “The key insight is that small-scale behavior seems to occur in a very different large-scale kind of turbulence.”</p>
<p class="p4">“As an observational oceanographer, this (finding) makes life very difficult,” said Carl Wunsch, professor emeritus of physical oceanography at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One can no longer assume that an observation of a process in any one part of the ocean reveals much about the same process in another part of the ocean, he explained. This could be troublesome for both scientists who observe the oceans and those who make numerical models.</p>
<p class="p4">“What (Wunsch) is talking about is absolutely true,” Fox-Kemper said, agreeing that lognormality may present a challenge for scientists. Despite the difficulties this may pose, it is likely to increase the accuracy of climate models in the future. “If the real world behaves in the same way as these models do — which we don’t have any obvious reason to doubt — then we need to consider this effect as we think about the flow of energy from large scales to small scales in our climate models,” Fox-Kemper said.</p>
<p class="p4">For instance, when running high-resolution models, scientists ought to check that the statistics they obtain are consistent with lognormality, he explained. If not, the model is quite possibly inaccurate. Furthermore, all measurements of large-scale to small-scale energy transfer should be interpreted as being part of a lognormal distribution and not any other statistical distribution, he noted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Scientists map mineralogy of large lunar basin</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">University researchers recently published a study examining the mineralogy of the moon’s South Pole-Aitken basin, which could serve as guidance for future explorations on the moon. The study, published in the “Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets,” was led and coauthored by Daniel Moriarty, postdoctoral researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, and Carle Pieters, professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences.</p>
<p class="p2">The SPA basin, an impact crater on the far side of the Moon, is thought to be one of the oldest and largest basins on the lunar surface, Moriarty said. “Impacts are primary drivers of solar system formation,” he said, adding that understanding these impacts is vital to learning about the formation of planetary bodies. “Part of why the SPA was chosen was because it is big, roughly the size of half the United States, so it could help us understand large impacts.”</p>
<p class="p2">The presence of mantle material as well as the possibility of past volcanic activity also led researchers to study the SPA. “The mantle of this planetary body tells us a lot about how the object was formed many millions of years ago, as well as its geological history, so it’s been an area of great interest for quite a long time now,” said Ralph Milliken, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences.</p>
<p class="p2">Data was collected by NASA’s Moon Mineralogy Mapper, a spectrometer launched on India’s Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft. Pieters was the principal investigator of this spectrometer.</p>
<p class="p2">Ratios of absorbed and reflected light of different wavelengths offered information about the mineral composition of the rocks, Moriarty said.</p>
<p class="p2">The paper describes the detection of deposits from volcanic activity, which points to the possible creation of volcanic material after the impact and the flowing of this material into the center of the basin, he said. Moriarty also mentioned the value of exposed mantle material, since accessing such materials on Earth would require digging down more than 60 miles.</p>
<p class="p2">Researchers agree that the study could offer insight into possible landing sites for future explorations. “The study opens up a very clear guideline for how to return samples from this part of the moon,” said Jack Mustard MS’86 PhD’90, professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences. Since both mantle material and volcanic material on the moon interest scientists all over the world, Moriarty suggested that landing in an area close to both of those substances could yield a greater return.</p>
<p class="p2">“With Earth, we can go out there and verify different hypotheses of what’s out there, but with space objects, such as the moon, it requires more detailed analyses on the ground either by rovers or humans,” Milliken said. “The study helps us figure out where we should go for these future explorations, because we want to understand what else could be there.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New research aims to improve solar panels</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to a recent study by University researchers, a new material called Cesium Titanium (IV) Bromide can replace lead in a specific type of solar panel. The study’s goal is not necessarily to replace commonly used silicon solar cells, but to create environmentally stable and conscious solar cells that are more affordable and have broader applicability.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The new solar cells are about “1,000 times thinner” than silicon solar cells, said Nitin Padture, co-author of the study, professor of engineering and director of Brown’s Institute for Molecular and Nanoscale Innovation. “These thin films can be made flexible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you try to bend a silicon wafer, you’ll shatter it. But when the film is so thin, it can be flexible, so you can put them on a camping tent, or a backpack, or clothes or umbrellas,” Padture said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The researchers focused on solar panels based on perovskite, a material with a crystal structure allowing for increased conductivity, lower cost and better solar cell properties, according to the American Ceramics Society. The study found that lead-based perovskite panels contributed to toxicity in the environment and increased volatility, but this new material provides a less toxic alternative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“The amounts of lead in solar cells are quite small,” said Robert Hurt, professor of engineering and head of the Laboratory for Environmental and Health Nanoscience. “We have lead in a lot of old products, we have lead pipes that our drinking water flows through, but those are all legacy things,” he added. “But to put new products on the market that contain lead is always going to be of some concern.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“(Perovskite solar cells) also contain an organic molecule in the crystal structure that actually helps it be a good absorber,” Padture said. The presence of this molecule and the lead make a “good” solar cell, but the molecule is volatile outside the lab and lead is toxic, so the goal was to circumvent these issues, Padture added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Typically, (solar panels) are made of silicon,” but due to the complex formation process, “there is a lot of cost involved,” Padture said. “So there’s always been a motivation for reducing the cost in the last 25 to 30 years.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“In 2009, this new technology of perovskite solar cells took a foothold,” and while the efficiency was just 4 percent in the beginning of development, the cells recently reached a new record of about 23 percent efficiency at a reduced cost, Padture said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The reason that these solar cells are so efficient is because they contain lead, and lead helps in absorbing light.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Our goal is not to replace the silicon solar cells. We want to boost the efficiency,” said Min Chen GS, co-author of the study. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Tandem cells can be formed by combining perovskite and silicon technologies, Padture said. This process boosts the overall efficiency of the solar cell, as each type only absorbs certain spectrums of sunlight, Padture said. “Perovskite you can actually tune to absorb a complementary part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t absorb,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The project is in collaboration with the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, where they run “computational modeling, because there are thousands of compounds that are lead-free, but we cannot test each of those in the lab,” Padture said. “They complete experiments on computers screening thousands of possible compounds” based on the desired properties for the solar cells, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“If you just do experiment after random experiment, there are too many, and you’re not going to be able to find the perfect combination,” Padture said. “Integration of computation and experiment is really key for making advances, and that is where the future is for research.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Researchers at the University took the suggested compositions from modeling for further testing, Padture said. This showed that computational modeling predictions could be actualized in a lab environment, and led to the use of this new substance..</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“Silicon needs to be melted at 1500 degrees Celsius,” while the new materials only need to be heated from around 100 to 200 degrees Celsius, so there’s a huge energy savings cost, Padture said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“It’s not just the device itself, but someone has to make the device, and people have to mine the lead, and there’s a whole chain behind it. So if you can get rid of the toxic substance in the beginning, then you’ve certainly done a good thing,” Hurt said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“There are a lot of other costs with using cheap toxic materials, so you have to take special steps to protect the workers and the environment,” Padture said. “In general, cheap toxic materials do not make good economic sense.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Erin Beck weighs effectiveness of NGOs in Guatemala</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Erin Beck PhD ’12, associate professor of political science at the University of Oregon, began her dissertation on the role of nongovernmental organizations with a simple question in mind: NGOs may come into “developing” nations intending to bring about constructive change, but are they actually effective in doing so?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Beck spent seven years tackling the question between 2007 and 2014, eventually publishing her results in the book “How Development Projects Persist: Everyday Negotiations with Guatemalan NGOs.” In a lecture delivered March 7, she spoke about what she learned in Guatemala and the difficulties and misconceptions that plague many intervention missions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Her research focused on two firms specifically: Namaste, which worked to empower women entrepreneurs through loans, classes and the strengthening of traditionally “Western business values”; and Fraternity, which took a ground-up, grassroots approach to change centered on self-improvement. Though these two organizations took different approaches, the bulk of her lecture focused on the history of Namaste as well as its effect on Guatemalan women.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beck described her work as an in-depth longitudinal analysis that involved interviews with members of Namaste and its beneficiaries and surveys of the women involved, among other sources of information. “I basically took on the role of an anthropologist,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Her extensive research did not answer the question of which NGO was more effective. “I hate that question,” she said. This line of inquiry is the wrong one to take, she said; instead, researchers should bear in mind the processes that take place as NGOs intervene in these countries.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">However, her research sheds light on the impact of NGOs and the potentially problematic ways they communicate with citizens of a developing country. Namaste views Guatemalan women as “undercapitalized entrepreneurs” who need only a boost to make their respective businesses take off. This way of thinking makes sense, but is ultimately flawed, she said. The founders of Namaste are successful entrepreneurs who assume that Guatemalan women want the same things Western business people want, such as more money and business growth. They rely on their own experiences to influence how to structure their NGO intervention processes, she said. However, some of the women with whom Namaste worked were not interested in growing their businesses whatsoever, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Both NGOs and beneficiaries tend to maintain a much more complex view of themselves than of the other, leading them to make many assumptions, Beck said.</span><span class="s1"> For instance, beneficiaries often view NGOs only as sources of loans and assistance and understand that their intervention might not have an impact in the long run. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">This mismatch in expectations accounts for the low impact of NGOs, whose approaches to financial assistance are often ineffective. </span><span class="s1">Though studies may show a slight increase in the average income for these women, this could mean that some are facing growth while others are facing substantial losses ­— not that Namaste has truly tapped what it would consider to be their entrepreneurial potential. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Despite this, NGOs such as Namaste do not leave; in fact, they often view their shortcomings as a success, or at least as the potential for future success, Beck said. </span><span class="s1">In addition, the fact that women interact with the NGOs in the first place signals demand to NGO leadership, meaning that changes often go no further than paperwork, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This difficulty is only compounded by the fact that the founders of these NGOs often do not want to accept that the venture in which they have invested so much money and time is not working, leading them to assume the opposite.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beck does not attempt to give a definitive answer as to how NGOs can change for the better, since her research did not focus on this question. No grand statements should be taken away from her research, she said. However, she does shed light on some of the more problematic aspects of NGO intervention.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It was a really interesting and engaging look at how, due to the structure and management of a lot of NGOs, well-intentioned programs are often pretty ineffectual,” said Wylie De Groff<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>’21. “I think it’s really important for NGOs from ‘developed’ countries to be self-critical … (and) help people in places like Guatemala on their own terms rather than trying to replicate industrial Western economies across the world.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Statewide program treats opioid use disorder in jails, prisons</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Rhode Island Department of Corrections’ medication-assisted treatment program reduced overdose deaths among recently incarcerated persons in the state by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>61 percent and cut the number of overdose deaths statewide by nearly 12 percent, according to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2671411?redirect=true">a recent study</a> published by JAMA Psychiatry. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The program, which began July 2016, treated 1,300 individuals afflicted with opioid use disorder in jails and prisons in its first year, according to Substance Abuse Coordinator Lauranne Howard. Now in its second year, the department is expected to exceed that figure, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The program initially grew out of Governor Gina Raimondo’s Overdose Prevention and Intervention Task Force, which details how the state should reduce opioid overdose deaths in the next three years, said Public Information Officer of the R.I. Department of Health Joseph Wendelken.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We were looking at where we wanted to focus our treatment efforts (and) which populations were at highest risks,” Wendelken said, adding that a priority of Raimondo’s initiative is extending treatment to those who have been incarcerated. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mortality rates as a result of overdose are much higher among individuals recently released from correctional facilities — specifically in the first two weeks after release — than the general population, said Jennifer Clarke, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology and medical programs director of the Department of Corrections. When an individual experiences “a period of forced abstinence,” their tolerance will significantly drop, Clarke said. A lower tolerance leaves recently released persons at greater risk for overdose death if they resume using opioids at the same dosages as before their incarceration.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“With this program, we’re trying to eliminate that increased risk by treating as many people as possible,” Clarke added. “It’s going very well.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Each individual entering a R.I. prison or jail is screened and evaluated for opioid use disorder. The RIDOC MAT program will then place individuals diagnosed with the disorder on their own, unique regimen, which includes one of the three Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for opioid use disorder, group meetings, individual counseling and discharge planning for when they leave the facility.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the RIDOC MAT program treats many individuals who are starting treatment for the first time, it also allows people who began treatment prior to entering the RIDOC to stay on their original treatment plan, according to Howard.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We are having a lot of people come in on treatment who stay on treatment,” Howard said. “Then there are folks who may have been here for a while but their discharge date is coming up and they are really worried about their ability to handle their addiction in the community and they’ve asked to be put on treatment … as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The official in charge of planning discharges<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ensures that individuals on the program leave the facility with access to an opioid treatment program in the community, allowing them to continue treatment without pause, Howard said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">CODAC Behavioral Healthcare, a Rhode Island-based non-profit involved with addiction treatment and education, is responsible for providing the medication determined by RIDOC’s program. While being treated, individuals are registered within CODAC’s system and are considered CODAC patients, which allows them to be seen at any of the CODAC locations throughout the state upon release, Clarke said. During the discharge process, patients have the opportunity to change their treatment provider from CODAC to other treatment centers, such as Discovery House Comprehensive Treatment Center of Rhode Island or The Journey to Hope, Health and Healing, Wendelken said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking forward, Howard hopes the program can expand to treat more people for a longer period of time. Currently, only those with a sentence of a year or less are qualified for MAT due to the costs of treatment. “Now that we have a year behind us, we would definitely like to expand the length of time that we’re able to treat people to perhaps two years,” Howard said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The program is the first of its kind in the country, according to Clarke. While Rikers Island has had a MAT program for several years, it only offers methadone, one of the three FDA-approved medications for opioid use disorder. RIDOC’s program offers the other two FDA-approved medications, buprenorphine and naltrexone, said co-author of the JAMA psychiatry study Dr. Josiah Rich, professor of medicine and epidemiology.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Rich believes the program’s success is the “first piece of good news of this epidemic in years.” Rich, alongside other researchers, is now collecting more data on those who have participated in the program to determine if they stay on treatment after discharge, he said. Rich is expecting to have more answers in the </span><span class="s3">next year, he added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Housed in the recently opened Engineering Research Center, the Brown Brain Fair welcomed more than 800 attendees to learn more about brain sciences Saturday. Organized by the nonprofit Cure Alliance for Mental Illness, the event was part of the third annual Brain Week Rhode Island, which aims to raise awareness about the “progress and benefits” of brain science, according to the organization’s website.</p>
<p class="p2">Victoria Heimer-McGinn, a post-doctoral fellow at Providence College whose father founded the nonprofit, created Brain Week Rhode Island to showcase the types of brain research occurring in the state and to educate people about what scientists have learned about the brain in recent years. The program also came out of “a desire to make brain research accessible and fun to the public,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2">The week-long series of events sponsored by the Brown Institute for Brain Science and the University of Rhode Island George and Ann Ryan Institute for Neuroscience included dance workshops for the movement impaired, displays showcasing brain-inspired art, a storytelling event focused on experiences with science and two brain fairs with dozens of interactive exhibits on brain research, advocacy and mental illness.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’re sneaking in the teaching of science through fun stuff, ” Heimer-McGinn said.</p>
<p class="p2">Throughout the week, an “army of neuroscientists” traveled to Rhode Island high schools with preserved human brains to teach students about the complex workings of the organ, according to Heimer-McGinn.</p>
<p class="p2">The Brown and URI Brain Fairs capped off the week of events. “Brain science, most people think, is just neuroscience, but there’s a lot of cognitive science involved, and engineering too,” said Anna Xu ’18, one of the organizers of the University fair and head coordinator of the neuroscience outreach group Brown Brain Bee said. “We’ve really tried this year to make sure that we had a lot of disciplines coming together.”</p>
<p class="p2">Assistant Professor of Neuroscience and of Psychiatry and Human Behavior Theresa Desrochers organized one of the booths at the University fair. The busy exhibit allowed attendees to see the effects of trauma on tofu, which according to Desrochers, is very close to the consistency of the human brain. “I think people in general are really surprised at what the consistency of the brain is actually like. People have really learned a lot about why (protecting your brain) is an important topic,” she said.</p>
<p class="p2">At the fair, there was also a spotlight on the activism around brain diseases and related technological advances, Xu said.</p>
<p class="p2">The fair’s target audience spanned a wide range of ages, with an emphasis on making the event family friendly, said Dorothy Yam ’19, another organizer of the fair and head coordinator of Brown Brain Bee.</p>
<p class="p2">“Rhode Island is making neuroscience one of the cornerstones of its economy, so it’s pretty exciting to see how (the brain fair) is placed in the greater Rhode Island community,” Yam added. “It’s exciting to have Brown be a part of that. Although we are a private institution, we want to make sure we reach out to the community, and through neuroscience, there’s a way to do that.”</p>
<p class="p2">Last year, about 3,500 people attended the week’s events, with about 800 coming to the Brown Brain Fair, up from 1,500 people and 600, respectively, during the inaugural year, Heimer-McGinn said. This year, she expects the numbers to grow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the wake of the 2015 San Bernardino terror attack, the nation witnessed a new and unfamiliar debate when the FBI — in possession of the shooter’s encrypted iPhone 5c — tried to compel Apple to provide “exceptional access” to the phone’s encrypted contents. While national dialogue surrounding law enforcement’s ability to require access to encrypted evidence has waned since then, a committee of academics and professionals including Seny Kamara, associate professor of computer science, formed in 2016 to discuss what policymakers should bear in mind when developing solutions to the encryption debate.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The committee released a report in February that poses questions they believe are critical to the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Encryption — the act of turning understandable “plaintext” data into unintelligible “ciphertext” — is an old concept, said Fred Cate, vice president for research at Indiana University and chair of the committee that wrote the report. While encryption technology applied almost exclusively to government and industrial interests for centuries, it has become incredibly important with the advent of computers and the Internet, playing a role in most online interactions. “Encryption now just surrounds us,” Cate said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As it stands, law enforcement agencies can get a warrant to seize a device and access its content. “But if the content is gibberish — if it’s all ciphertext — they have no authority to compel somebody to help them to get access,” Cate said. While law enforcement can compel someone to unlock their device via fingerprint or facial recognition, they cannot require that person to provide a password, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Law enforcement and the intelligence community are concerned with the widespread use of encryption. Members of these communities argue that the Internet is “going dark,” Kamara said. “What this means is that (law enforcement officials are) not able to have access to this end-to-end encrypted data, even though they have a warrant,” he said. It’s not clear, though, whether this increase in encrypted data simply reflects the overall increase in data, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The committee’s report, titled “Decrypting the Encryption Debate: A Framework for Decision Makers,” was sanctioned by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and focuses on the challenges that come with allowing law enforcement special access to plaintext data. It poses relevant questions that any possible policy proposals should consider, including: “What is the impact on cybersecurity going to be?” and “Will it grant access to everybody’s data?” Kamara said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“These are pretty commonsensical questions,” Cate said, offering further examples of questions the framework poses: “How many people will be affected by this solution? ... Who’s going to pay for it? ... If it requires inventing something new, does industry pay for it? Does law enforcement pay for it?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The report also outlines how encryption works, the challenges associated with granting agencies exceptional access to encrypted data and when granting such access might be needed, Cate said. Cases such as missing children or distribution of child pornography, for instance, are classic instances of when a law enforcement agency would want to defeat encryption, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But there are a number of technical and ethical problems surrounding exceptional access.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Any solution providing exceptional access to an agency would likely open a point of entry for security threats, said Vasileios Kemerlis, assistant professor of computer science. “It’s not clear whether we can provide that functionality to systems, especially to existing systems, without opening a door to everybody who wants to attack,” he said, adding that he does not think there is a solution that can reconcile access and security.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Kamara acknowledges that future cryptographic research could reveal ways of balancing law enforcement interests with the privacy of ordinary people. “Cryptography is something that is really, really powerful and can do things that we don’t expect, that are very unintuitive,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both Cate and Kamara said that the public should be more aware of consequences of the debate and sustain the conversation following events such as the San Bernardino attack. “The time to start thinking about these issues is not after the shooting has occurred,” Cate said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the field of engineering, there are several forces that scientists have to deal with when building structures or creating devices. One such force, adhesion— the attraction between two surfaces that can lead them to stick together — is particularly important on the microscale level. Because surfaces can be extremely small, engineers are often faced with the issue of these surfaces unintentionally adhering to one another. To try to alleviate this adhesion problem, University researchers conducted experiments to measure the work of adhesion, which is essentially the amount of energy required to separate a unit area of two surfaces stuck together.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When an object is next to a surface, forces act between this object and the surface, said Joyce Mok GS, who is studying solid mechanics in the School of Engineering. But if this object is large enough, gravity overpowers these other forces. “When you get to the point where (the object) is so small, however, this force of gravity is not going to matter as much… and (the other forces) do start to matter. And so that same principle is the reason why adhesion … is such a big issue for (microelectromechanical devices).”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Microelectromechanical systems are essentially systems consisting of microscaled, moving devices, Mok said. “You can use it in a lot of different fields,” she added, listing biology research and electronics as examples. Because many of these devices are so small, they require surfaces that are close together for efficient operation. “But then naturally, of course, this makes the problem (of adhesion) bigger,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The most common method that has been used to measure the work of adhesion involves the use of a microbeam, an extremely narrow beam of radiation, and its tendency to stick to a surface when placed near it. “Previous research related the work of adhesion for an adhered microbeam to the beam’s unadhered length, and as such, interferometric techniques were developed to measure that length,” wrote Mok and Wenqiang Fang GS, who is also studying solid mechanics, in a jointly-written article.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But directly finding that critical length at which the beam sticks to the surface is not easy, Mok said. What could be easier is using the natural frequency property of the beam, which would help determine this critical length and ultimately relate to the work of adhesion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Every structure has a frequency that it vibrates at when it’s resting,” Mok said. Finding that frequency can be done by shining a laser at one point on the structure with something like an atomic force microscope, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a standard AFM system, a microbeam with a sharp needle tip moves across a surface, and a laser within that beam measures its small movements. The beam’s movements across the surface could then be used to determine the surface’s properties. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mok and Fang modified this system by removing the needle tip of the beam. Instead, the microbeam is now lowered onto the test surface and then raised back up to result in part of it becoming stuck to the surface. The remaining unstuck portion slightly vibrates. By measuring the vibration, scientists are able to find the work of adhesion more easily.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The main advantage of our technique is that it is simpler to implement than the old methods,” Fang said. With older techniques based in interferometry, a large number of different samples are needed to gather many data points, which the new technique does not require. Their vibration-based technique is also “known to have high sensitivity and repeatability and is easy to use on a MEMS chip,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Determining a material’s work of adhesion has large implications in the field of MEMS, Fang said. “This new capability … will help alleviate the stiction failure of MEMS devices, (ultimately aiding) in the development of the MEMS field.” Development of more reliable microdevices, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, “will improve our lives in many different ways,” he added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the ever-evolving realm of health care in the United States, advancements in patient education have illuminated the need to change the structure of doctor-patient interactions. Research conducted by Michael Barton Laws, assistant professor of health services, policy and practice, Ira Wilson, professor of health services, policy and practice and others revealed that nearly 49 percent of patients fail to recall recommendations and treatments given by their doctors due to a lack of patient participation during visits and ineffective written communications presented to the patient afterwards.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a pilot project funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, the team recorded meetings between physicians and patients and later asked them to recall the interaction, Laws said. Although some patients could recall a good portion of the visit once prompted, the majority could remember only one to two thirds of the doctor’s recommendations from the same visit, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Renee Shield, clinical professor of health services, policy and practice who is unaffiliated with the study, feels that this research has even more salient results for the elderly. Shield, whose work examines health care for the elderly and general health practices, believes that the PCORI study shows that “the provision of health care is increasingly complex, … especially for older patients,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Any patient might have factors that prevent or inhibit their understanding of what the doctors tell them,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shield said. The conversational gap between patient and physician has led to a disconnect and necessitates this type of research, she added. “It’s a truism at this point that much of what happens in the doctor-patient interaction does not get either understood by the patient or recalled by the patient.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study identified two major issues in doctor-patient communication. First, consultations were usually disorganized — doctors have many visits to get through and delegated only about 15 minutes per patient, leaving visits at times rushed and scattered, Laws said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Further, the researchers saw a lack of shared decision-making in the consultation process. Wilson said doctors do not spend enough time listening to patients; if they did, doctors would make more informed decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The problem is it’s very difficult to get doctors to change their behavior,” Laws said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The researchers suggested the use of an agenda and a checklist of important topics for the visit to ensure that all items are discussed. Additionally, encouraging open questions throughout the consultation and finishing with a wrap-up between physician and patient could promote a more organized and thorough dialogue. The teach-back method — which encourages questions and dialogue between patient and physician — is vital to conversation and understanding, Wilson said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“People can’t be said to have shared in the decisions about their medical treatment if they don’t know and understand what happened in the visit,” Laws said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Improvement in patient-to-physician dialogue to increase shared decision-making is critical to patient education, the co-authors said. “It’s probably the most important thing that happens in medicine: doctors and patients talking with each other,” Laws concluded.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Faculty from a variety of departments representing diverse projects received the 2018 Research Seed Awards. Since 2003, The Office of the Vice President for Research has been distributing these awards to faculty members with promising new ideas, said Amy Carroll, director of research development. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The process of awarding this year’s Seed funds started at the beginning of the academic year when a call for applicants was released. Proposals were then reviewed by Brown faculty, with the final decision resting in the hands of Vice President for Research and Professor of Mathematics Jill Pipher, Carroll explained. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The Seed Awards are designed to serve as a gateway to further funding, which is why they target research at its earliest stages. “External funding organizations want to see … proof of concept before they will invest a lot of money in a new idea,” Carroll said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">From 2006 to 2016, the OVPR awarded roughly $5.1 million through its internal research funding; this money helped researchers get $70 million worth of external grants, Carroll said, adding that this is a “13:1 return on investment for the University.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Karl Kelsey, professor of epidemiology and pathology and laboratory medicine, received a 2018 Seed Award for epigenetics research that could eventually help analyze treatment outcomes for diseases like head and neck cancers. “The Seed Award … will help us generate additional pilot data that will help make it … more competitive for additional funding,” Kelsey said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Daniel Bjorkegren, assistant professor of economics, also received a Seed Award for a new project related to his previous research surrounding digital credit scoring for people in developing countries. His work addresses questions raised by the fact that “increasingly, many decisions are made automatically, using algorithms trained on data on human behavior,” he wrote in an email to The Herald. Bjorkegren’s research will seek to create a framework for when decision-making processes are made transparent, addressing the problem that people might want to change their behavior in order to gain an advantage once the inner workings of the system are revealed. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Research funded by past Seed Awards has gone on to find success at the University and beyond. A $100,000 grant given in 2006 to Elizabeth Brainerd, professor of biology and medical science, helped create an imaging system known as X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology, an imaging system which allows researchers to get a 3-D view of an animal’s skeleton in motion. This technology “could help to inform future medical applications and new basic understandings of animal motion that we haven’t had before,” Carroll explained, adding that it has garnered interest from other scientists across the nation who have traveled to campus and worked with Brainerd to gain a functional understanding of the system. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Students may be familiar with another product of the Seed Award program — the Rockefeller Library’s Digital Scholarship Lab, which was inspired by research completed by Professor of Engineering and Computer Science Gabriel Taubin after he received a Seed grant in 2010, Carroll added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">This year’s winners, and those of years past, represent a large scope of research interests among University faculty. “It’s really exciting to see the variety of ideas … and novel approaches to all sorts of societal issues, … whether looking back at history to learn something for today, (or) developing a new technology to help humankind,” Carroll said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EQUiSat to launch into space May 9</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Since its conception nearly seven years ago, a continuously revolving group of University undergraduates has been diligently working to send a satellite into space. Now, as May 9 draws closer, the group of over 200 past and current students and faculty can find catharsis as the EQUiSat will finally launch into orbit.</p>
<p class="p4">The project, funded by NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative, will send a small cube satellite to the International Space Station to then launch into orbit. The EQUiSat will test lithium iron phosphate batteries, which are used in machines such as lawn mowers, but find limited applications in spacecrafts. Due to its low cost and the fact that its latitude will coincide with that of Providence, which allows its LED flashes to be seen from the ground, the satellite will also serve as a symbol for the accessibility of space.</p>
<p class="p4">“A big part of the goal is proving the accessibility of space. … We kind of want to show people that space is right there,” said Hunter Ray ’18, the project’s co-leader and team manager. The project could have cost upwards of tens of thousands of dollars, but the team has kept its cost to just $3,776.61, Ray added. The project’s relatively low cost and mantra to “build it from the ground up” speak to the feasibility and accessibility of space.</p>
<p class="p4">The EQUiSat will be equipped with powerful LED lights, a small radio and multiple sensors to keep track of its trajectory and control steering. “Anyone with a hand radio can pick up its frequency. … We will be relying on the community of amateur radio (groups) around the world to help collect EQUiSat’s data,” Ray said. He described the construction process as his favorite part of the project. “It’s like a Lego set. You build it and you’re like ‘great, now what do I do,’ … but the mission will keep going.”</p>
<p class="p4">Ray has been a part of the project since he arrived on campus. “I started freshman year, first week … (I decided that) I want to build a spacecraft,” he said. “I ended up taking over for the power system development, … (and then) I was elected as part of the project’s manager and co-leader of the team,” he added. He hopes to see similar projections come together in the future following the EQUiSat’s launch. “The fact that as undergraduates we have been able to build an entire spacecraft from scratch … (it shows where) we are going with the space program, as humanity is progressing into the final frontier,” he said. Ray will be delivering the EQUiSat to Houston this week in order to facilitate preparations for the launch.</p>
<p class="p4">Anand Lalwani ’18 leads the power team, the group of 17 team members in charge of the EQUiSat’s solar power and battery construction. “We are a group of incredibly motivated, but incredibly fun people. Yes, we have had our arguments and fights, but we still work very well with each other,” he said. The power team not only constructed solar panels from scratch, but also ensured that they would survive a launch. Eventually finding a coating and the means to apply it to protect the delicate panels was a grueling process, Lalwani said. “We tried (different protocols) for about 12 months, … and we failed consistently,” he said. Finding a solution “was probably (Brown Space Engineering’s) biggest achievement,” as no other satellite group in the country had done this, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">The project also serves as an outreach symbol, Lalwani said. By talking to both middle school and high school students and teaching them about different aspects of engineering, the team hopes to show children that space is not as far-fetched as it may seem. “What we had pitched to NASA in our original mission was that ‘We are going to make space cool again,’” Lalwani said. He hopes to see BSE continue its work with new satellites being constructed in under two years.</p>
<p class="p4">“For BSE, our future is very bright. … All our future applications for launches such as this will be very likely granted. … We expect all the sophomores in our team to have a satellite they would have designed and built and launched before they graduate from Brown,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Max Monn GS, one of founders of the initial project, worked on the project from its initial creation in 2011 to 2013. “Since the manned space missions to the moon … (the public) had a declining interest for space” due to the lack of human connection, Monn said. The origin for the project began as a means for creating an idea in Adjunct Associate Professor of Engineering Rick Fleeter’s class, which has since evolved into ENGN1760: “Design of Space Systems,” Monn described. While other projects leaned toward theoretical concepts or plans such as the colonization of Mars, Monn and the other founders decided to plan something which was “down to Earth” and did not need a large corporation to complete, Monn said.</p>
<p class="p4">The EQUiSat’s LED lights flashing down toward Earth show the accessibility of space, one of the project’s main purposes. This element was inspired by Monn’s interest in photography. Following the initial work, the project expanded from a four-person class project to a student group. “We weren’t really sure how it would be received,” he said. At the first information session, 15 to 20 people showed up. Seeing the growth of the group has been one of Monn’s favorite memories of the project. “It feels like a legacy,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Serving as founder, member and mentor, Monn has seen the project evolve from “wires spread out on a table” to its eventual launch. “We had these visions of what it could be and to have left the project in such shambles … (and) having it become more and more real… (it’s) a pleasant surprise,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">“You don’t need to be a multi-millionaire, you do not have to be a rocket scientist, and space is not that far,” Lalwani said. The satellite will serve as a realization that the final frontier is truly not as far as it seems, he added. “EQUiSat is reaching down to everyone on the Earth and showing them that space is right there, and I hope that, in a sense, it helps unite everyone together,” Ray said.</p>
<strong><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Max Monn GS has worked on the EQUiSat since the project's creation in 2011. In fact, Monn worked on the EQUiSat from the creation of the project in 2011 to 2013. The Herald regrets the error. </em></strong>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an attempt to understand the effects that drugs like Adderall have on typical brains, scientists have found a relationship between activity of the neurotransmitter glutamate and mood for the first time, according to a study conducted by University researchers. </span></p>
<p class="p2">“Considering the rising prevalence of off-prescription use of ADHD medications as study aids, especially on college campuses, it is crucial that we understand how these substances affect the healthy human brain,” said Adam Nitenson GS, co-author of the study. <span class="s1">The study focused on psychostimulants that are commonly abused to enhance memory and learning.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Glutamate has been widely studied in recent years since the advent of more exact measuring techniques, said George Rebec, professor of psychology and brain sciences at Indiana University. “Thirty years ago, the main transmitters everyone talked about were dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine because they were relatively easy to measure.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Glutamate, “the brain’s principal excitatory neurotransmitter” is involved with processes relating to learning and memory, said Lisa Weyandt, professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Rhode Island. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While “all addictive substances result in an increase in dopamine,” scientists currently do not understand how other neurotransmitters like glutamate can contribute to mood and addiction, Weyandt said. “It doesn’t make sense that if you affect one neurotransmitter system, another wouldn’t be involved in some way as well.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Because “glutamate is important for driving a lot of motivated behaviors and goal-directed behaviors,” it can play a role in craving food or seeking the drug itself, Rebec said. </span></p>
<p class="p2">After administering a psychostimulant, researchers observed an increase in the presence of glutamate, measured through the use of a technique called magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The researchers tested two psychostimulants, both of which were ADHD drugs.</p>
<p class="p2">Furthermore, positive mood consistently followed glutamate production, according to the study. Women seemed to show a greater increase in glutamate response when compared with men, “indicating a heightened vulnerability to psychostimulants in females,” according to the study.</p>
<p class="p2">Because glutamate plays a major role in many brain processes, its potential effect on mood is unsurprising, Rebec said.</p>
<p class="p2">The study, however, did not speak to the cognitive effects of this glutamate increase, Weyandt said. It remains uncertain if this increase in glutamate translates into better planning or executive function, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">“It does appear that in healthy brains, there is a small effect for Adderall improving memory, but this is not found in all studies,” Weyandt said. Future research could help determine whether quality of work is actually being improved or if the drugs simply allow users to maintain attention for longer, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">In a previous study with ADHD subjects, glutamate increase was shown to last for a two-month medication period. This study observed non-ADHD subjects for only five hours, so long-term effects of the increase still need to be studied, Weyandt said.</p>
<p class="p2">“Kids may take these drugs early on, but what happens 20 years later, … that’s important research that, I think, still needs to be done,” Rebec said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We are still just scratching the surface of glutamate.”</p>
<p class="p2">Beyond opening questions for further research, the study offers a potential clinical application that takes advantage of the glutamate-mood link. “Maybe we could deal with a drug abuse problem by manipulating the receptors that respond to glutamate,” Rebec said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Reinforcement learning — a process during which humans alter their behavior as they learn which behaviors yield the best results — and working memory — which allows people to optimize decision-making by keeping track of previous actions and their consequences — appear to be two separate modes of human learning. But a recent study has demonstrated that the two processes cooperate to assist humans as they learn.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anne Collins, assistant professor in the department of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley and former postdoctoral researcher at the University, and Michael Frank, professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences, co-authored the study.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“People used to view these two systems as independent of each other during the learning process,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frank said. “This study shows that reinforcement learning and working memory work together when they operate, rather than compete.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Participants in the study had to learn associations between symbols and corresponding buttons on a keyboard, according to a University press release. Researchers recorded brain activity during the learning process using EEG, which provided real-time data, Frank said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We varied the number of items shown on the screen,” ranging from “numbers less than the average capacity working memory and numbers more than the average capacity,” Frank said. There is a limited amount of items that can be held in working memory, and the duration of time which these items can be held is also finite. Taken together, when the number of symbols and the delay between the symbols increase, the working memory component in the learning process should shrink, according to the press release.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study revealed that brain signals associated with reinforcement learning were stronger when participants were given stimuli that overloaded working memory. But these signals were weaker when participants had to hold fewer items in working memory, Frank said. These findings suggest that the two systems are dependent on each other, because varying the inputs for working memory should not alter reinforcement learning signals if they were independent systems.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“While this study examines learning at a more basic science level of how discrete learning systems work in the brain, there are probably learning applications in the long run, but we are not at that stage yet,” Frank said. “However, understanding the biology of the two different systems can allow us to better predict how learning processes are affected among people with mental disorders and illnesses that affect these parts of the brain.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This is quite an important finding that advances our understanding of the learning and memory systems that drive adaptive behavior,” said Candace Raio, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Neural Science at New York University. “Knowing that these reinforcement learning and working memory systems work cooperatively constitutes a major step forward in understanding how we learn and adapt to environmental demands.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Postpartum depression, experienced by one in seven mothers in the United States, is more than twice as common among low-income women, according to a press release from Michigan State University. Researchers from Michigan State and the University are now studying how a program shown to help prevent postpartum depression might be implemented in clinics that “serve at-risk populations” across the country.</p>
<p class="p4">The program, called ROSE (Reach Out, stay Strong, Essentials for motions of newborns), was developed by Caron Zlotnick, a researcher at Care New England and research professor in the department of psychiatry and human behavior. Funded by the National Institutes of Health, the study aims to examine what would be required to sustain the program on a larger scale as part of “implementation research.”</p>
<p class="p4">The researchers are working with 90 clinics in six states to see how they can best adapt the program, said Jennifer Johnson MA’13, co-author of the study, adjunct associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior and professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at Michigan State.</p>
<p class="p4">Risk factors for postpartum depression include a history of depression, exposure to traumatic experiences and stressful life events, Johnson said. “For example: not having enough food to eat, not being able to get transportation, having conflict with your partner or not enough social support.”</p>
<p class="p4">Among financially disadvantaged women, strong social support has been found to limit negative stress reactions, Zlotnick wrote in an email to The Herald. “Empirical studies corroborate that greater social support is associated with lower depressed mood in perinatal financially disadvantaged women,” she wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">Studies suggest that women with fewer financial resources have both more stress and less familial support, which are both risk factors for developing postpartum depression, wrote Amy Salisbury, associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior, in an email to The Herald. There is a general consensus that treatment of a mother’s depression is the best way to mitigate and prevent its negative effects on their child’s development, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">ROSE “was developed because there were few interventions that demonstrated significant reduction in cases of postpartum depression and few, if any, studies (that) included women who were financially disadvantaged,” Zlotnick wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">The ROSE program consists of four in-person sessions, followed by a phone call after the baby has been born, Johnson said. It is an educational program, rather than a mental health treatment, that teaches women coping skills and helps them build a social support system.</p>
<p class="p4">In five clinical trials, groups that underwent the ROSE program saw fewer individuals experience postpartum depression than the groups that did not, Johnson said.</p>
<p class="p4">Prior to the research that is currently being conducted on the implementation of ROSE, the program had been studied in five clinical settings in Rhode Island, as well as in Mississippi and throughout prenatal clinics in Japan, Zlotnick wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">By bringing the ROSE program to 90 new clinics, the researchers hope to get a better understanding of what it will take to sustain the program on a larger scale. They plan to develop a sustainability plan and train clinics to implement the program and navigate operational logistics such as billing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by July, Johnson said.</p>
<p class="p4">“It doesn’t help to have effective interventions if they’re not used,” Johnson said, adding that it’s important to know what helps an intervention program like ROSE sustain long-term influence and continue to be implemented, especially in clinics which might not have many resources.</p>
<p class="p4">Salisbury wrote that she is “pleased to hear that the intervention has been successful in clinical trials and is being prepared for wide-range use in other locations. Prevention of depressive illness in pregnancy and postpartum should be the goal, to prevent any potential influences on development.”</p>
<p class="p4">Women considering pregnancy or who are already pregnant and have a history of depression should explore the resources available to them or consult with a perinatal mental health specialist to know what their options are, Salisbury added.</p>
<p class="p4">Johnson emphasized that postpartum depression is common, and support is available to those who experience it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b> Study sheds light on ALS development, potential treatment options</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">An international team of researchers, including Thomas Serre, associate professor of CLPS, Justin Fallon, professor of medical science, Amanda Duffy GS, PhD candidate in the neuroscience department, and Youssef Barhomi, research assistant for the Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences department, studied and conducted tests on mice that were genetically modified to carry TDP-43, a protein that causes a hereditary form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in humans, according to a University <a href="http://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/als">press release</a> published last month.</p>
<p class="p2">Through their examinations of the ALS<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>developing in the mice, the scientists discovered that “behavioral, cognitive and structural dysfunctions …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>were evident long before the neuronal degeneration that occurs late” in the disease. Researchers also found that unlike other degenerative diseases that result in early losses of excitatory neurons, the early development of ALS yielded a loss of inhibitory neurons, according to the release.</p>
<p class="p2">In addition to functioning as the basis of future research into ALS and providing opportunities to possibly create therapies treating ALS in its early stages, the study underscores progress in the creation of animal models that mimic ALS symptoms in research.</p>
<p class="p2">Additionally, the Automated Continuous Behavioral Monitoring system, an artificial intelligence technology developed at Brown, played a critical role in allowing researchers to study the mice closely and accurately for extensive periods of time.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Study links visual cues to vowel perception </b></span></p>
<p class="p2">A study conducted by researchers at the University and at McGill University found that when people perceive speech, they rely heavily on visual cues, closely watching the movement and form of the lips, according to a University <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/speech">press release</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">To reach this conclusion, researchers tested individuals’ “directional asymmetry” when visually perceiving vowels. Directionally asymmetry allows people to better distinguish “between two versions of the ‘oo’ sound,” according to the release.</p>
<p class="p2">During the study, researchers had volunteers listen to a “bilingual Canadian woman” make “oo”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sounds in English and French, so they could determine what visual information and cues were pertinent to directional asymmetry. Directional asymmetry can be seen in Canadians who speak French and English because in French, the “oo” is more pronounced than in English.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Researchers led by U. professor discover new antibiotics to combat superbugs </b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Last month, a team of researchers led by Eleftherios Mylonakis, a professor of infectious diseases at the Alpert Medical School, discovered a new class of antibiotics that could potentially combat superbugs, bacteria that have developed a resistance to conventional antibiotics, according to a University <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/mrsa">press release</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Specifically, researchers identified two synthetic retinoids that exhibited an ability to kill MRSA, a “staph bacteria that is resistant to several antibiotics.” These retinoids impair bacterial membranes and destroy MRSA “persister” cells “that are drug-resistant dormant cells,” according to the release. Additionally, the team created new ways to screen over 80,000 synthetic compounds to find potential antibiotics that are not toxic to humans.</p>
<p class="p2">To carry out the study Mylonakis worked with specialists from Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Massachusetts General Hospital, Emory University and Northwestern University.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Under the Dean of the School of Public Health Bess Marcus, Brown has increased its efforts to promote public health and educate the community. This week, the school planned activities for National Public Health Week, which included symposiums, poster sessions and advocacy events aimed at educating the Providence community about the many facets of public health. Though the event has taken place for many years under the American Public Health Association, this is the first year that the school planned events for the entire week, as opposed to only organizing a Public Health Research Day as in previous years.</p>
<p class="p4">Brown’s renewed involvement is part of Marcus’ effort to highlight the school’s work in the community. “I’m a new dean, and I really wanted to call attention to all of the great work that our students are involved in, our faculty are involved in and what we’re doing as a community,” Marcus said, adding that she hopes to raise the school’s profile. “We focus on research, we focus on teaching and education and we focus on service to the community, and this week is about celebrating all those parts,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">The school hopes to educate the wider community about public health as well. “It’s really a great opportunity for the School of Public Health to reach out to the greater Brown community and the greater Providence community to really put on these fantastic events that celebrate public health,” said Meghan Gonsalves GS, a health communications scholar who worked to promote this week’s events.</p>
<p class="p4">Notable events for the week included a panel on tobacco use, an event addressing obesity in the United States and a healthy cooking demonstration.</p>
<p class="p4">On Tuesday, a public art project entitled “One Gun Gone” advocated for gun control by displaying art pieces with weapons to raise funds for a buy-back program and further aid families affected by gun violence. “Hearing personal stories from students and people who have been affected by (gun violence) is really compelling,” Gonsalves said, adding that “to see the guns in an art form of wax and glass rather than hard metal is a very interesting way to view it.”</p>
<p class="p4">One of the busiest days of the week was the Public Health Research Day, where undergraduate and graduate students prepared posters to present their own research. “Research day is the culmination of all of the activities and interests students have in research,” said Director of Public Health Communications Karen Scanlan.</p>
<p class="p4">Students wrote abstracts and created posters to present to peers, other researchers and faculty. “This is a fantastic opportunity for students to push their research and get involved with teaching others about what they do,” Gonsalves said. She added that she hoped presenters would also gain confidence and form connections with other researchers in the field, a key goal of the week.</p>
<p class="p4">Marcus said she hoped that the event would spur future research. “They’re the next generation. They’re going to take all that we’re doing forward,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Though the week focused on public health, it aimed to encourage people of all concentrations to take part as well. “This week is for everybody. Public health touches every single person’s life in some way because it’s how we act, what we do, our health and everything that affects an individual,” Gonsalves said.</p>
<p class="p4">Marcus hopes that events like these will continue to grow in the near future. “This is really just the beginning of what we’re hoping to do,” she added. “You’ll see more partnerships with other programs at (Brown) … and us partnering with more of our community partners in coming years.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>University study finds compounds for possible MRSA treatment</title>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A recent University study published in Nature will open doors for antibiotics research by addressing an increasingly relevant crisis — the existence of superbugs, a term to describe antibiotic-resistant bacteria and infections caused by the prevalent MRSA bacterial strains. Researchers identified two compounds that could potentially kill the drug-resistant bacteria. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">MRSA cells are deemed “persisters” because they are responsible for chronic infection, said Wooseong Kim, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral researcher at the Alpert Medical School and the Rhode Island Hospital. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">MRSA infections can be acquired when patients are admitted to the intensive care unit or other hospital wards, wrote Eleftherios Mylonakis, professor of infectious disease, in an email to The Herald, adding that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deemed them a “serious threat.” According to the CDC’s website, two in 100 people carry MRSA.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These chronic infections put patients in “a very challenging position,” as they must continually seek treatment. With traditional antibiotics, the infection enters a dormant stage before eventually reanimating, said Beth Fuchs, co-author of the study. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study, which began in 2010, involved a series of experiments on C. elegans, a type of nematode worm. The researchers identified 185 compounds that decreased MRSA’s ability to kill the worms, Mylonakis wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The researchers then selected two well-studied compounds from the list of 185 to further investigate. The compounds were both retinoids, which target the lipid bi-layer of the cell membrane. In contrast, traditional antibiotics work to disrupt bacteria’s metabolic processes. The compounds’ different method of attacking the bacteria proved essential for treating MRSA-based infections and their persister cells. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beyond the study of these compounds, the research identified a target through which the persister cells could be attacked. The authors believe that this target could be used for new drugs and future research on MRSA-killing compounds, Fuchs said. In order to reach the stage of drug development, researchers will have to investigate the compounds for patient safety and comply with Food and Drug Agency tests, Fuchs added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study brought together a team of scientists across multiple disciplines. “We worked together with medicinal chemists, geneticists, engineers and computer scientists,” Mylonakis wrote, explaining that this multidisciplinary effort enabled the group to understand the action through which the retinoids functioned. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Julian Hurdle, associate professor of microbiology at Texas A&amp;M University, who is unaffiliated with the study, confirmed that the discovery of the compounds “is very promising.” But given the “number of parameters that have to be met” in the clinical setting, the notion that the compounds could become a pragmatic treatment for MRSA is “a hope, but not a guarantee,” Hurdle said. He added that the technology and methods employed for this study provide the opportunity to uncover more molecules and optimize them for antimicrobial purposes.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">With the buzzword “data-driven” gaining traction as a hot topic within many disciplines today, researchers and students flocked to the Serre Lab’s workshop on deep learning and the field’s myriad applications last Saturday.</p>
<p class="p4">Deep learning is a set of algorithms that analyzes a large amount of data to improve specific processes under study. The workshop, “Beyond Deep Learning,” is part of a lecture series that aims to bring together cognitive science and computer science to present new ways for approaching artificial intelligence and its plethora of applications.</p>
<p class="p4">Tom Griffiths, professor of psychology and cognitive science at Princeton, Dima Amso, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and David Heeger, professor of psychology and neural sciences at New York University, spoke Friday afternoon about recent advancements in mapping biological human intelligence to create computational models for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class="p4">Heeger focuses on a few different fields: working memory from cognitive psychology, computer science algorithms and their<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>overall connection to neurobiology.</p>
<p class="p4">“Working memory is a cognitive process that is responsible for both maintaining and manipulating information over time,” Heeger said. Working memory requires combining information encountered in the present with past memory and experiences, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">On the other hand, computers do not have an unlimited amount of memory to store information, Heeger said. “The concept is that you have a state that you update over time, and you carry forward some information and throw away some information and transform some information,” he added. This constraint makes it difficult for researchers to model working memory, since working memory necessitates access to past experiences that computers may have overwritten.</p>
<p class="p4">In contrast to working memory, “psychologists use the term ‘short-term’ memory just to refer to maintenance of information over time” but not the manipulation of such information, Heeger said.</p>
<p class="p4">In recent years, researchers have begun to use an algorithm called a Long-Short Term Memory network to manipulate information. Such manipulation more closely resembles the processes involved in working memory as opposed to short-term memory.</p>
<p class="p4">LSTMs are “simple algorithms that can solve seemingly complicated tasks,” Heeger said. Such tasks can include language modeling and eye movement tracking.</p>
<p class="p4">Essentially, eye movement requires that the brain manipulate information on a coordinate basis — a process that researchers now track with LSTM algorithms, Heeger said. “Working memory and other kinds of executive function such as attention may depend on the same computational engine as motor preparation, motor control and sensory processing,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Griffiths took the podium to discuss using computer science to create predictions about human behavior. Researchers hope to explain how we interpret information in the world from natural stimuli that are faced everyday and not just simplistic stimuli, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Griffiths uses computer science to study an individual’s psychological visualization of an image rather than the activity of neurons.</p>
<p class="p4">The issue is that these representations “are not really things you can see or touch. We have to rely on behavior to tell us about what some of those underlying representations might be,” Griffiths said. While machine learning sheds light on behavior prediction, it raises the challenge of explaining that behavior, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">“In reality, there are a lot of complex stimuli that humans face, so it’s important for computers to be able to analyze this vast amount of information and model how humans classify their information in order to interpret it,”
Griffiths said. Researchers can then model the behavior and decisions that people make and “predict peoples’ classification behavior very well,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">This empirical treatment of psychology is unusual because the subject is normally studied with theoretical models, Griffiths said. Now, researchers can look at inputs and data facilitated by computational methods in order to make predictions about behavior, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">“We sort of passed the threshold where hand-engineered models had more bias (than the deep learning models),” Griffiths said.</p>
<p class="p4">While Griffiths’ work uses computational methods to understand human behavior, Amso’s research is focused on how we can use human behavior, especially in the case of infants, to inform computer science.</p>
<p class="p4">There is a high amount of complexity in human-infant interactions, not only in the baby’s actions, but also in the data the baby is receiving, Amso said. Information enters the system through the senses first and then enters the brain, she added. “This gives me a framework (from which) to ask my questions so that I don’t ask my questions in a way that is inconsistent with the biology of the system,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Researchers must take into account how the visual system is developed. To address this, researchers use eye trackers to monitor where a baby is looking in order to see if the baby is observing the whole image and actually understanding what is happening, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">But “the data depend on the state of the visual system … and the full visual field is not sufficient” to determine what the baby is actually understanding and viewing in the world. Tactile information is necessary for babies to actually get an idea of the 3-D shape of objects and the world around them.</p>
<p class="p4">“I think (this series) does a good job bringing together the psychology department at Brown, which has a strong computational history, and the strong computer science department,” Harrison Ritz GS said.</p>
<p class="p4">“I always think it is pretty cool to see the intersection of neuroscience and computer science, as someone who works in machine learning,” Dan Shiebler ’15 said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine playing a video game that also makes scientific contributions to the field of computational biology. Firas Khatib, assistant professor in the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, discussed just that in his talk, “Crowd Computing: Scientific discoveries by protein-folding game players” at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics. Khatib’s program, Foldit, is a unique platform that integrates video games with protein folding to allow people all over the world to compete to devise an optimal protein fold for a given protein.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Khatib, the lead scientist of Foldit, emphasized that the program aims to build more accurate models of disease-related proteins.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“I think what’s exciting about Foldit is that it really demonstrates the power of citizen science and crowdsourcing,” he said, and added that there is currently an abundance of supercomputing strength, but Foldit focuses on harnessing human intelligence on a mass scale.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“When it comes to visual tasks … computers are really bad at that,” Khatib said. Identifying optimal protein folds, a visual task, is a skill that humans can sometimes provide more easily than computers. Furthermore, Foldit allows people with different perspectives to contribute to difficult problems. People who have no background in a field are more likely to implement unusual solutions, which sometimes turn out to be helpful, Khatib said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Because Foldit relies on human brain power, an important part of the project is introducing it to large audiences. Foldit is a “great tool for education,” Khatib said. “Everybody loves video games — especially kids.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Foldit has been used in award-winning projects by people all over the country, Khatib added. For example, a team of students at University of California-Davis used Foldit to build a biosensor that “detects rancid olive oil,” winning the grand prize at the 2014 iGEM international competition, Khatib said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’m really impressed by the way (Foldit is) implementing this evolving model,” Woden Kusner, attendee and assistant professor of mathematics at Vanderbilt University, said after the event. “They’ve got a nice feedback loop going on with players and are able to get feedback from the scientific community.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“There’s such a big Foldit community out there,” said Jan Rolfes, a postgraduate researcher from the University of Cologne. “If you present science in such a nice way, you can attract a lot of people and really make an idea quite popular.”</span></p>

		<title>Thirty University students, alums chosen for grants</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">After proposing projects on topics ranging from particle physics to the mechanisms of chewing in animals, 30 University students and alums have been selected as winners of the National Science Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowship. The 2,000 overall winners were selected from a pool of more than 12,000 applicants, according to a press release from the NSF.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This year marks the third consecutive year that at least 30 University affiliates have won the fellowship. “I think it’s becoming increasingly evident that Brown is a place where outstanding training and programming (exist) at both the graduate and undergraduate levels,” wrote Dean of the Graduate School Andrew Campbell in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Among this year’s winners was Jenna Wurster GS, a doctoral candidate in the pathobiology program. Wurster proposed a research project focusing on how both vegan and non-vegan foods impact the kimchi microbiome, the microorganisms in one’s body. She was inspired by a similar study that she co-authored on the impacts of kimchi. That study, led by Michelle Zabat ’18 on an Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award, was recently published in the Food Microbiology journal. Eventually, Wurster hopes that the research will be used to produce food with a better shelf life.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As part of their application, candidates were required to submit a personal statement. Several of the University’s awardees discussed the importance of mentorship in their work and giving back to the greater community. Wurster highlighted the importance of communicating science outside of the scientific field. Researchers have to “avoid the trap of locking ourselves in the lab and not talking to anyone,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">J.J. Lomax GS, a student in the ecology and evolutionary biology department, also focused on the role of giving back to others. While an undergraduate at the University of South Florida, Lomax was inspired by a professor to take up research. Now as a graduate student, Lomax mentors high school students at the Paul Cuffee School in Providence, hoping to motivate students while they study the sciences.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lomax proposed a project focusing on chewing for non-mammalian animals. Typically, research on chewing focuses on mammals because they are most similar to humans, Lomax said. But he hopes to broaden the horizons of the field by expanding his research to other types of animals. Most people “don’t understand how much work goes into taking a bite out of an apple,” Lomax said. He will study the muscles, teeth forms and neural control involved in chewing with the fellowship money.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Researchers were awarded a $34,000 stipend for three years, as well as tuition support for up to $12,000 per year. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Evan Coleman ’18, one of this year’s winners, said that the money will enable him to focus on his research as a graduate student in physics at Stanford University in the fall, rather than devote his attention to typical graduate student tasks such as working as a teaching assistant or residential advisor. He hopes to eventually implement his fellowship project, which works to develop new machine learning techniques for detecting signals from the Large Hadron Collider, a massive particle accelerator at CERN in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Justin Dong GS, a doctoral candidate in the applied mathematics department, said that the fellowship will give him “the freedom to choose (his) own path,” unimpaired by financial and work commitments. Dong plans to start his project on the compression of large data sets this summer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University’s success with the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship is the latest example of Brown’s track record with awards that “represent hallmarks of distinction and excellence,” Campbell wrote. Students have received a high number of honors such as the Fulbright award and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Gilliam Fellowships for Advanced Study in recent years, he added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The Brown Institute for Brain Science is receiving a $100 million gift from Robert Carney ’61 and Nancy Carney, one of the largest single donations ever given to the University. BIBS will be renamed the Robert J. and Nancy D. Carney Institute for Brain Science in honor of the donation, according to a University <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/04/carney">press release</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">President Christina Paxson P’19 said the Carneys’ gift will have a “transformative” impact on the University’s capabilities in brain science. The newly renamed Carney Institute will expand educational opportunities and propel fundamental brain research, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Brain science for years has been a gem at Brown,” Paxson said. While Associate Director of the Institute Christopher Moore agreed that the Institute has long “had a national footprint and a size that has been impressive,” he emphasized that the Carneys’ gift will make the University “one of the top places in the world” for brain science research.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The gift is targeted at promoting medical advancements, Paxson said. “The dream is that we’ll have a cure for Alzheimer’s, or we’ll have a way to treat or prevent (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) or any of a number of conditions,” she said. But she stressed that forming a better understanding of how the brain works is another important goal of the research.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The gift is not so we can take a moonshot at curing some single disease,” Moore said. “What this gift will do is it’s going to underwrite the great discoveries that will cure those diseases. It’s going to create the environment in which they can be addressed at the deepest level.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Treatments for brain disorders remain elusive because the “basic mechanisms that explain why certain neurons die in these different diseases” are not fully understood, Director of the Institute Diane Lipscombe said. The Carneys’ gift will allow the University to provide sustained funding for research aimed at “converting discoveries and innovation into biding cures and treatment,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Institute is already engaged in innovative brain science research, Lipscombe said. She pointed to the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/04/university-study-improves-interfaces-brain-computers/">BrainGate project</a>, which has worked to restore function to people who are paralyzed by translating brain signals into the control over a machine. This technology requires electrodes to be implanted on the surface of the brain, and additional funding from the Carneys’ gift will help BrainGate researchers make these electrodes “smaller, less invasive, but still able to collect a rich amount of data to read neural signals,” Lipscombe said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Expanding research on “the neural code that is underlying complex behavior” could also lead to a host of new discoveries, Lipscombe added. She raised the possibility that BrainGate technology could someday be used for other applications, such as restoring vision.</span></p>
<p class="p4">This is not the first time the Carneys have donated to the Institute. Moore said that smaller gifts from the Carneys have “been a big part of the success (of the Institute) leading up to this point.” Lipscombe noted that the Carneys’ latest gift far surpasses previous funds raised by the Institute. “In the last several years, we probably raised about $50 million in philanthropic giving to the Institute,” she said. “To have this as a single gift is quite extraordinary and quite impactful.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moore believes the Carneys’ gift will allow less restricted exploration of new possibilities. “It lets us not have to be narrowly, strategically focused, and instead to really go where the ideas will take us,” he said. Rather than focusing support on any one line of research, Moore added that the new funding will more broadly stimulate “the most aggressive and creative and collaborative attack on what it means to be studying how the brain works.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lipscombe noted that the interdisciplinary nature of brain science research fits in well at the University. “There is a great uniqueness around the way in which people here at Brown approach and try and tackle big problems in brain science — a very collaborative and integrative kind of approach,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This collaborative process will be on full display when the Carney Institute moves into the fourth floor of the former Brown Office Building at 164 Angell St. after its renovation early next year. Lipscombe said the new laboratory spaces will focus on developing computational approaches to understanding brain functions and improving diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“What this allows us to do is make the discoveries that will change the way we think about how the brain works, not just add to the way we think about how the brain works,” Moore said. “I do think — absolutely — this gift is going to lead to great medical discoveries.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sumatran rhinoceroses once inhabited a vast expanse of land in mainland East Asia, according to a new study by University professors. Today, they are located primarily in Sumatra, Indonesia.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Due to hunting, expansion of the human population and increased agriculture, the area occupied by these rhinos has shrunk significantly ever since the start of human development in the first millennium B.C. Now, hunting and agriculture practices still continue to drive down the number of Sumatran rhinos, raising concerns that they will become extinct.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Previous research suggested that “the Sumatran rhino was doomed to die out, and that you could see it in the DNA sequence,” said Brian Lander, assistant professor of history and environment and society. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But DNA does not provide sufficient ability to predict the extinction of living rhinos, Lander said. Current Sumatran rhinos have been separated from the rhinos that existed on mainland China 9,000 years ago, he said. “So their DNA does not tell us anything about the whole population (of those in Indonesia),” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to Lander, there is no question that the primary cause of the Sumatran rhino’s impending extinction is humans and not nature. For scientists to suggest otherwise is “very problematic,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Sumatran rhino’s ecosystem is affected by the increasing human population and its consequent need for increased agricultural land, said Bathsheba Demuth, assistant professor of history and environment and society.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The issue is that many domesticated species, such as cattle, survive in the same environments that rhinos do, said Tyler Kartzinel, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and of environment and society. Humans concentrate in these areas where their domesticated animals can live, and impinge on the ecosystems of native animals. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Populations of larger animals are more likely to end up endangered as a result of humans, Kartzinel said. Some large animals are good food sources for humans yet reproduce slowly and end up becoming threatened, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Essentially, it’s a combination of humans turning (the Sumatran rhino’s) natural habitat into farmland and hunting them for their horns,” Lander said. “That’s the whole cause. If there were no humans in the region, there would be plenty of rhinos,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The only way you can really reverse it at the local level is to maintain ecosystems in their natural form,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The question essentially comes down to choice and whether humanity in different ecosystems values the animals dead or alive, Demuth said. Hunting pressure and agricultural land expansion are human choices; therefore, it is a human choice to maintain the habitats of creatures such as the Sumatran rhino, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem is that people of East Asia regard rhino horns as a powerful medicine, which creates a strong economic incentive to poach these animals, Lander said. Poachers are even hunting rhinos in Africa to sell their horns in the East Asian market, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The horns of these animals are extremely valuable on the international market for people in countries where they don’t have a lot of economic options” for health care, Demuth said. “There is a situation of racial and economic inequality that’s at play,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It is so difficult to stop both the processes of land conversion and illegal hunting,” so it is very likely the Sumatran rhino will be driven to extinction, Lander said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The factors threatening the Sumatran rhinos are the same ones that are affecting many animals, Lander said. “If you look at it in the larger historical picture, there is nothing particularly unusual about the situation,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People need to reconsider their interactions with ecosystems by watching fuel usage and creating access to goods and services in an environmentally sustainable way, Demuth said. Humans should act on another set of cultural values to make that happen, she added. “It is going to take some work and deliberate decision-making to reimagine what our relationship with consumption looks like,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“But I think this article shows quite convincingly that this is a much longer process,” Demuth said. “It’s not just this particular modern moment, but something that has much deeper roots,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rewilding and restoration are two attempts to revitalize nature that could possibly save the Sumatran rhino, Kartzinel said. Rewilding is the practice of placing animals in a new area, such as the Great Plains of the United States, or even Siberia, while restoration is the practice of reintroducing a species of animal that has become nonexistent in a particular place. The Sumatran rhino could be added back to its previous native location of mainland China, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These may be strange and quite controversial ideas, Kartzinel said. But this research may reveal how we may be able to reverse the ways humans have damaged animal populations, he added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">What began as a debate in 1981 between Professor of Biology Kenneth Miller ’70 and scientific creationist Henry Morris has evolved into the publication of a biology textbook, appearances on television programs, involvement in court cases and the publication of books such as “Finding Darwin’s God” and, most recently, “The Human Instinct: How We Evolved to Have Reason, Consciousness, and Free Will.” Following the book’s release, Miller spoke at the Brown Bookstore Thursday evening to discuss the material of his book and its implications. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the event, Miller quoted excerpts from his book while explaining the prevailing topics. “The Human Instinct” aims to explain the presence of free will and consciousness and how evolution is not a degradation of human significance, but rather evidence to support humans’ true nature and importance. “Of all the creatures of all the forms of life, … only the human creature seeks answers to questions in the stars,” Miller said, quoting his book. On free will, Miller maintains that a purely deterministic approach would oppose the human choices that define the scientific process.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though Miller’s academic work is more focused on cellular biology, he has become a notable spokesperson for the teaching of evolution, serving as an expert witness in two federal court cases regarding the use of his textbook in school districts. Additionally, his writings advocate for connecting religious faith and evolutionary principles. “I wanted to convince other people that you can look at the evolutionary history of our species and use that evolutionary history to confirm the special place and the special responsibility that human beings have,” Miller said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">During the event, Miller mentioned notable names as inspirations for his work, including Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawking and Marilynne Robinson ’66, a novelist. Miller identified Robinson’s work as one of the inspirations for his treatment of “bigger picture issues,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This woman is not a science denier, and yet, she fnds these Darwinian implications to be, as she put it, ‘chilling,’” Miller said. Robinson’s work, which includes “Absence of Mind” and “The Death of Adam,” speaks to the issues with a purely evolutionary foundation of thought. “Natural selection produced a species … that was capable of transcending the mere demands of survival and reproduction,” he said. “From that transcendence, we derive the great characteristics of civilization.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In attendance were friends, family and colleagues anxious to hear about Miller’s newest work. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Clare Grossman ’21, a student in Miller’s biology course, attended to support her professor and because of her general interest in science. “It’s very important work to reconcile the theory of evolution with the belief that so many Americans hold, because evolution is such an important part of understanding science,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Following his talk at the bookstore, Miller plans to attend a plethora of events<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in the coming months and hopes that his book will further the discussion of scientific inquiry as complementary to religious faith, he said. He also said he hopes the book serves as a “pep talk for the human race” and generates “a sense of optimism about human nature, about the capabilities of the human species and a sense, also, that evolution … doesn’t limit and define what human beings are capable.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We really do have a special place, not just on this planet, but even in the universe itself,” Miller said. “This book attempts to provide scientific support for that.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Kimchi, a Korean side dish composed of seasoned, fermented vegetables, has become popular in recent years, especially among health-conscious consumers. The staple Korean accompaniment was the focus of a recent study led by Michelle Zabat ’18 and Will Sano ’16 and completed in the lab of Peter Belenky, assistant professor of molecular microbiology and immunology. The study explored the impact that different production methods have on bacterial communities withinthe fermented foods that people consume.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As more and more people look to buy kimchi and other fermented products such as sauerkraut, companies have changed their production methods to increase efficiency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The researchers studied the changes in fermentation processes that have come with this shift in production processes. Consumers have particularly been attracted to kimchi because it is a probiotic, meaning it promotes the proliferation of healthy bacteria within the body. “Recently, with the whole rise of probiotics as a concept, fermented foods are becoming more popular, especially in health conscious circles in the United States,” Zabat said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The science behind (probiotics) is not as rigorous as it could be,” Belenky said. “We don’t yet know which probiotics are important, but nonetheless a lot of the reasons why people purchase things like kimchi, kombucha, or yogurt … is because they believe it has a benefit for them, from the probiotic perspective,” he added. The study took a closer look into these foods and assessed the bacterial population that people ingest when they eat these products. Studies like this one help people gauge whether or not foods actually do contain probiotic bacteria, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To accommodate demand, production companies have started to break from traditional fermentation methods, Zabat said. For example, some have started to replace the typically used fermented seafood with miso paste, making the product vegan. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Both of those ingredients contain their own communities of lactic acid bacteria that will ferment the material,” Belenky explained. The project aimed to establish whether or not vegan production methods produced a differing final bacterial composition, and concluded that it did not.“If you want to make vegan kimchi, it’s going to have the same final bacterial properties as the traditional kimchi,” he added. “The selective pressure of the fermentation environment is so strong that it doesn’t really matter what your input is. … You will establish a (bacterial) community that is the same, no matter what,” he explained.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In order to evaluate the bacterial compositions of the various kimchi models, the researchers analyzed samples taken from the ingredients that compose kimchi, the fermentation facility and the final product. Then researchers sequenced the DNA of these bacteria, which allowed them to identify which bacterial species were present, she said. Inspired by Belenky’s personal passion for fermentation and Zabat’s interest in food science, the project started as a “side venture” in the lab, which focuses primarily on microbiomes in the human body and environment, Sano said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I almost view kimchi as a small, microcosm of (the lab’s greater focus). It is also a microbial community that responds to a stressful stimuli,” Belenky said, explaining that the salty conditions in which kimchi is produced are analogous to the stressors that are studied with regard to the microbiome in humans, for example.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The lab’s capabilities were well suited to the researchers’ interest in food science, given that the study called for many of the same methods employed by other microbiology research. “What’s exciting about the technology that exists for profiling bacterial communities is, you don’t need to sequence the entire bacterial genome in order to figure out what they are,” Sano said. A single, short gene, 16S, codes part of the ribosome and can be sequenced to determine the species of a bacterium.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The project served as an opportunity for Zabat and Sano to gain experience in a low-stakes context, Sano said, adding that it allowed them to gain expertise in the necessary methods without involving high-risk, high-cost human tissues. Both Zabat and Sano plan on building upon this experience in their future endeavors.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baylor Fox-Kemper, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences, was selected as a coordinating lead author for a chapter of the next global climate assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Along with two other coordinating lead authors, he will direct a team of 20 scientists in writing chapter nine of the report, which focuses on Earth’s ocean dynamics, sea levels and the cryosphere — the parts of earth where water is solid. Baylor was among 800 scientists chosen to contribute to the report out of over 3,000 applications from all over the world, Fox-Kemper said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I’ve found these reports to be a really useful resource, … and I’ve been reading them and thinking about them since my student days,” Fox-Kemper said. “This is an opportunity for me to return the favor and pass on my knowledge to the rest of the world by summarizing what the state of the field is now like.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Instead of trying to come up with new experiments to conduct, the report will primarily focus on summarizing the progress made in climate research since the last report in 2014, according to Fox-Kemper. The chapter will also evaluate the current capabilities of modeling changes in the oceans and how those models can be made more accurate in the future, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The IPCC’s first Assessment Report was published in 1990, and a new one is published every five to seven years, Fox-Kemper said. The report that he is co-leading is the sixth Assessment Report, which is scheduled for release in 2022. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fox-Kemper’s work at Brown involves studying the relationship between ocean dynamics and cryosphere change. He develops computer models to simulate these relationships, as well as other ocean processes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Baylor is so passionate about his work,” said Qing Li GS, who studies under Fox-Kemper. “While he is technically my advisor, he often brings up interesting science topics to talk about with me on a more friendly basis.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Baylor knows everything!” said Abigail Bodner GS, who also studies under Fox-Kemper. “He’s involved in so many projects related to his field of work and often meets with leaders in this field from all over the world to discuss their work.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think one of the reasons he was chosen to contribute to the report was because he’s so well respected in this sector of the scientific community. What he says will be taken very seriously by everyone else,” added Aakash Sane GS, who is also from the department.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s a big honor to be doing this, and I hope I do a good job,” Fox-Kemper said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">It is hard to believe that the wide-eyed, puffy-tailed rabbits that scurry around campus are actually an invasive species, while the species native to the region is disappearing. These endangered New England cottontails are the focus of Kimberly Neil-Cohen GS’s research. Threatened by the disappearance of their natural habitat, the New England cottontails are becoming overshadowed by the Eastern cottontail, a burgeoning species which is able to survive in environments with thinner patches of cover.</p>
<p class="p3">Neil-Cohen, a fifth-year doctoral candidate in the ecology and evolutionary biology department, studies genetic variation in the New England cottontail and hopes to expand her research to include the Eastern cottontail as well. Specifically, she looks at the histocompatibility complex, a set of proteins that influence immune system function, in the New England cottontail.</p>
<p class="p4">Because New England cottontails are endangered in Rhode Island, knowledge of their genetic health can inform the rabbits’ risk to disease and help states make decisions on how to move rabbits between the five remaining populations in the Northeast to enable their survival, Neil-Cohen said. Her dissertation research involves developing genomic-based methods for detecting potential pathogens. These methods are more cost-effective and efficient ways of determining microbes that could put the endangered rabbit species at risk, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">Current species management plans focus on providing better success for the New England cottontails rather than eradicating the Eastern cottontail said Catherine Sparks, assistant director of the Bureau of Natural Resources at the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. These plans include carefully studying and monitoring the “five remnant populations” of rabbits in the Northeast, including a captive breeding and conservation project at the Roger Williams Park Zoo, Neil-Cohen said.</p>
<p class="p4">One conservation strategy involves increasing the population’s genetic diversity to improve its health. Neil-Cohen’s research also involves analyzing the diversity of functional, significant genes of the New England cottontail. “It’s very encouraging that they have retained moderate diversity,” she said. “There’s strong evidence that (these genes) are under natural selection.”</p>
<p class="p4">Neil-Cohen works closely with the Roger Williams Park Zoo, as well as wildlife departments across New England and researchers at the University of Rhode Island. Together, they aim to conserve the New England cottontail species. “One of the greatest pieces of this work is how collaborative it is,” she said. “It’s wonderful as a student to be a part of research that spans state and federal wildlife agencies, zoos and other facilities,” she said. She credits the University for her positive research experience. “The quality of science that happens in the ecology and evolutionary biology department is outstanding — there’s a great sense of community and incredibly supportive mentorship.”</p>
<p class="p4">Because there is currently “no hope” of eradicating the invasive Eastern cottontails in New England, according to Sparks, we can expect them to remain a hallmark of Brown’s scenery. “I see them a lot,” said Camille Tulloss ’21. “Sometimes I see four in one day.” Despite their invasive status, the rabbits appear to be quite friendly and approachable, Tulloss said. “You can often get close to them, but I’ve never personally chased one before.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p3">For 11 hours a day, Lan Anh Pham ’18 meditated under rigorous Vipassana tradition in rural Wisconsin as part of a 10-day meditation retreat during her sophomore year. Upon returning to Brown, she was confident that she wanted to study contemplative experiences. “I was blown away by how much I could change my perception of myself,” Pham said.</p>
<p class="p4">At Brown, Pham has the unique opportunity to engage in practices and studies typically confined to an ashram, or a monastery. Originally a biology concentrator, she switched to contemplative studies, one of Brown’s newest concentrations and a pioneering field of research for the University.</p>
<p class="p4">The Contemplative Studies Initiative — comprising University faculty dedicated to fostering academic discussion about contemplation — formed in 2004. The group established the first undergraduate concentration in contemplative studies at a major North American research university in 2014.</p>
<p class="p4">The concentration involves studying a “particularly important subset of human experiences,” said Harold Roth, professor of religious studies and director of the initiative. These experiences of “being focused in the moment, undistracted, calm and tranquil” are normally attained in religious contexts such as yoga, meditation, mindfulness and prayer, he explained. At Brown, however, the concentration also looks at how these moments arise spontaneously in activities such as sports, music, art and science.</p>
<p class="p4">Faculty involved with the concentration have backgrounds ranging from theatre and performing arts to political science. For example, “the whole art of acting — putting yourself in a role, setting aside normal elements of self-identity and projecting yourself into the identity of a character — can be a very fulfilling contemplative experience,” Roth said.</p>
<p class="p4">This interdisciplinary approach has established Brown’s program as a model for other universities, such as the University of Virginia, the University of Miami and the University of Mary Washington, Roth said. “Brown is part of a national movement,” he added. “I really see this as a wave of the future.”</p>
<p class="p4">Before the concentration became official at the University, faculty in the Contemplative Studies Initiative advised 16 independent contemplative studies-related concentrations. The initiative has steadily grown and hopes to have over 50 concentrators in contemplative studies by 2023, according to a 2017 internal presentation.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Start of the program </b></p>
<p class="p4">Over 20 years ago, Roth told his then-student Srinivas Reddy ’98, visiting professor of religious studies and contemplative studies, that he was “thinking of a doing a class where we read texts on meditation and have meditation labs,” Reddy said.</p>
<p class="p4">At the time, having people meditate wasn’t a part of the curriculum and carried controversial religious connotations, so the “class” was “totally hidden and under the radar,” Reddy said. “We would meditate in his (office).”</p>
<p class="p4">After Reddy graduated, he embarked on a multidisciplinary immersion in South Asian philosophy and music. While training as a professional concert sitarist, studying classical Indian texts and teaching abroad, he kept in touch with Roth, occasionally performing contemplative music recitals when in Providence.</p>
<p class="p4">As contemplative studies at the University started to build momentum, Roth asked Reddy to teach a class in August 2017. Reddy currently teaches COST 0035: “Saints and Mystics of India” and COST 0100: “Introduction to Contemplative Studies.” Through his teaching, he hopes to inspire students to learn about the world and themselves, he said.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Criticism and considerations</b></p>
<p class="p4">A common criticism of studying Eastern religious practices in university settings is cultural appropriation, or the adoption of aspects of one culture by another, especially when there is an unequal power dynamic.</p>
<p class="p4">In Pham’s opinion, “cultural borrowing has always been happening” in human history. As Buddhism traveled from India to other countries, newly exposed cultural groups understood and practiced Buddhism within their cultural framework, she explained.</p>
<p class="p4">“An interesting phenomenon of Buddhism and Buddhist practices traveling to the West is its integration in our rigorous scientific culture,” Pham said. Scientific research looking to identify how Buddhism changes our mind and body is an infusion of Buddhism into Western culture, she added. “For me, appropriation is when we are taking away pieces of tradition without respecting it.” Pham doesn’t believe appropriation is occurring.</p>
<p class="p4">The concentration aims to deliver this respect through combining “third-person approaches and critical first-person approaches” in its pedagogy, Roth said. This combination gives equal weight to historical cultural context as well as the effects those practices have on an individual, he explained.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, the contemplative studies program has come under criticism for cultural appropriation in the past. In 2016, a group of students <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/04/22/students-protest-alums-performance/">protested a performance</a> by Carrie Grossman ’00 titled “An Evening of Devotional Music.”</span></p>
<p class="p4">The performance was “not an exclusive and official event of the contemplative studies concentration,” Roth wrote in a follow-up email to The Herald. It was organized by the student groups the Yoga and Mindfulness Group and the Contemplative Studies Departmental Undergraduate Group and funded by YAM, the Office of the Dean of the College and the contemplative studies program. Roth added that Grossman had previously performed classical Indian music at Brown in an official contemplative studies-sponsored event in summer 2015 with Reddy, a trained sitarist.</p>
<p class="p4">A co-leader of the protest, Sohum Chokshi ’18, wanted to draw attention to “the fact that (Grossman) wasn’t trained in classical hymns and was mispronouncing words,” demonstrating a “very infantilizing notion of what Hindu meditation is,” Chokshi said. “If the contemplative studies department isn’t vigorously attacking standards of producing and sharing knowledge, then it’s not doing its job,” Chokshi added.</p>
<p class="p4">Roth also wrote that the program has long been mindful not to culturally appropriate. “Since our beginning, we have made it a point of working hard to make our concentration and the events we organize very sensitive to questions of diversity and inclusion,” he wrote.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These steps include organizing and funding a year-long lecture series in 2016-17 titled “Mindfulness, Science and Society.” Courses in the concentration, such as COST 0100, COST 0410: “Engaged Buddhism” and COST 1950: “Senior Concentrators’ Seminar,” also include vigorous discussion about cultural appropriation, Roth wrote. Furthermore, though the concentration technically does not need a Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, as it is a program and operates administratively under the Department of Religious Studies, it is currently working on one to be published by the end of the summer because “we think it’s important,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4">Though critical, Chokshi acknowledges that the presence of contemplative studies in the University is significant. “It just has to be done in an accurate, historically represented way,” Chokshi said.</p>
<p class="p4">The emergence of contemplative studies at the University also promises opportunities to “support scholarly work on Southeast Asia,” according to a message from the Southeast Asian Studies Initiative to The Herald. “One of our goals as the Southeast Asian Studies Initiative is to convince departments to hire faculty who study the region, and contemplative studies should have an interest in such faculty.”</p>
<p class="p4">The Chinese Students Association, Asian/American Political Alliance and Hindu Students Association did not reply to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>A growing department at Brown </b></p>
<p class="p4">Over the next decade, the Contemplative Studies Initiative hopes to sustain its growth and establish an Institute for Contemplative Studies, modeled after the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. A key goal of the initiative is to bring core elements of its teaching to several fields at Brown, creating opportunities for multidisciplinary research.</p>
<p class="p4">For example, examining the medical potential of contemplative practices is a burgeoning sector of University research. In September 2017, the University launched a new <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/04/university-opens-new-mindfulness-center/">Mindfulness Center</a>, which brings together a diverse array of researchers who are investigating early findings that mindfulness could positively impact mental and physical health.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The center is directed by Eric Loucks, associate professor of epidemiology, who studies the relationship between mindfulness and cardiovascular health. He, alongside Willoughby Britton, assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior, and Jared Lindahl, visiting assistant professor of religious studies, received a five-year, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/09/29/with-grant-brown-to-collaborate-on-mindfulness-research/">$4.7 million grant</a> in 2015 from the National Institutes of Health to study the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on people’s abilities to follow medically recommended lifestyle changes. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Other research areas related to mindfulness include neuroscience, cognitive science, clinical science and positive psychology. Including the NIH grant, the Contemplative Studies Initiative has raised over $7.5 million to fund projects related to studying the effects of mindfulness on ailments such as asthma, stress, fatigue, chronic pain and depression.</p>
<p class="p4">Additionally, a large portion of the multidisciplinary nature arises from contemplative studies students’ work, Roth said.</p>
<p class="p4">Pham, for example, wants to be a nutritionist and bring together the “triangle of mental, emotional and physical health to enhance people’s well-being.”</p>
<p class="p4">In a different vein, Micah Thanhauser ’13 melds an artistic approach with his contemplative studies background. At Brown, he graduated with an independent concentration in “Contemplative Studies: Creativity and Consciousness,” combining his interests in religion and art. “I wanted to look at how art-making and appreciation of art can in itself be contemplative and meditative. … I really look at my time in the studio making pottery as a contemplative time,” he said. Beyond Brown, Thanhauser also worked for the Prison Mindfulness Institute, a nonprofit where he facilitated mindfulness courses in prisons and shelters. He currently works as a potter in Asheville, North Carolina, and teaches pottery and meditation.</p>
<p class="p4">Knowing how to use a contemplative studies background in the workforce is not always clear, Thanhauser said. However, contemplative studies, like other liberal arts, teaches skills applicable to any field — “how to think, problem solve, learn quickly and interact with people.”</p>
<p class="p4">“The most important part of meditation, or what I got from contemplative studies, is that you can actually cultivate and practice being more aware of life,” Thanhauser said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ban on ‘mitochondrial replacement’ dooms children, experts say</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Nestled within the 2016 federal spending bill is a brief unrelated provision, or “rider,” which became law in December of 2015. It has no known sponsor and underwent no public debate, yet this portion of the bill could have drastic implications for those born with mitochondrial diseases such as Leigh Syndrome or Alpers Disease, according to researchers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The rider prohibits the Food and Drug Administration from approving research in which a human embryo is “intentionally created or modified.” This ban encompasses “Mitochondrial Replacement,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a technique in which a donor’s mitochondria are used to replace those in an embryo at risk of developing mitochondrial diseases, said Eli Adashi, professor of medical science and former dean of medicine and biological sciences.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a commentary published in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, Adashi and I. Glenn Cohen, professor of law at Harvard University, wrote that the benefits of MR outweigh its risks, and that research into the technique should be decoupled from the moratorium on editing the genes of human embryos.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mitochondrial diseases are caused by “faulty mitochondria” in human cells, and estimates suggest they affect as many as 1,000 babies each year. To prevent these diseases from occurring, MR therapy involves substituting these mitochondria in the mother-to-be with those from a healthy donor, Adashi said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the technique is still the subject of research, it is “on the precipice of implementation,” Adashi said. In the United Kingdom, the first human trials have been approved for a limited number of women. That number could increase depending on how the trials progress, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Criticisms of modifying embryos come from ethical and religious points of view, which were likely the reasons the rider was included, Adashi said. For one, the Catholic Church objects to in vitro fertilization, which is required to complete MR therapy. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Possible ethical objections to editing genetic data in embryos stem from the notion that genes in a child could be selected, said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. “Many people don’t want to cross the line into making heritable changes by engineering,” Caplan said. “They worry about the slippery slope argument: If we let this mitochondrial DNA be repaired by moving genes from a donor, then we’ve crossed the line into making changes in what can be inherited by offspring and down the generation, and that’s going to lead us to eugenics.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, Caplan doesn’t believe these criticisms should keep research into MR therapy from progressing, citing the fact that mitochondrial DNA does not have a large impact on traits.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I understand that people are worried that something might happen that they don’t expect by manipulating the mitochondria,” Caplan said. “But I think we have enough experience to let the procedure be tried.” The procedure would not be common, and the amount of DNA being transplanted is small, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This is not an anti-life procedure. This is (a) pro-life procedure. That’s probably the most important thing,” Adashi said, adding that “the idea is to cure disease and bring healthy children into the world. That seems to most observers to be a fairly legitimate, ethically appropriate and religiously acceptable approach.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s indescribable, the suffering these children must go through,” Adashi said. Symptoms vary for those whose mitochondria do not function properly, depending on where the problem arises. “If it’s muscle, you can’t move; if it’s brain, you can’t think; if it’s heart, you can’t survive very long,” Adashi said, adding “there’s no cure, unfortunately. So the only approach to this is prevention, which is what mitochondrial replacement is.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Adashi and Cohen believe the law to be misinformed rather than deliberate in its prohibition of MR therapy. “It was aimed more likely at germline gene editing, and MR (therapy) got swept up in that because of the way the rider was written,” Cohen wrote in an email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An expert in FDA law and “medical tourism,” among other areas, Cohen wrote that the United Kingdom’s promotion of broad public debate and consultation is unusual in the United States, but would be a welcome addition. “In the absence of U.S. regulatory approval, we will likely see more medical tourism for these services,” Cohen wrote, pointing to a case in which a Jordanian family underwent the procedure in Mexico.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Adashi and Cohen state that making the case before Congress is important in alerting lawmakers to this issue. “Nothing will happen unless some activism takes place,” Adashi said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“By putting those parents in this position, the law essentially dooms up to 1,000 children to a life that is both severely compromised, and often very short,” Adashi said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Scientists advocate for forensic science reform</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/26/scientists-advocate-for-forensic-science-reform/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Contrary to popular belief, many of the forensic science tools used in today’s courtrooms are not actually subject to empirical validation, but rather are accepted on the basis of historical precedent: If the practice was allowed in the past, it is allowed now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Six independent scientists who served on the National Commission on Forensic Science — including world-renowned scientist and University Professor of Physics Sylvester Gates, better known as Jim Gates — are advocating to change the standard in the justice system from historical precedent to empirical validation. In their coauthored piece published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they encourage the scientific community at large to advocate for “urgently needed research, testing and financial support” to accomplish this reform.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“There’s a whole category of forensic procedures that are controversial, known as the feature comparison methods,” said Thomas Albright, a neuroscientist and one of the six coauthors at the Vision Center Laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, who studies the failures of eyewitness accounts. Examples of these methods include matching fingerprints, tire marks and blood patterns to recorded examples, he said. The problem with such techniques is that most of them evolved largely from law enforcement. “They didn’t emerge out of science … and the consequence of that is they’ve never been adequately tested for validity in the laboratory,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Additionally, many forensic methods are unreliable because of their inherent cognitive biases. “Cognitive bias seems to be permitted in many current practices in the forensic science domain,” Gates said in a University press release. “Over centuries, most of science has developed in such a way to avoid this natural tendency. This is the main reason that science has been able to provide the most accurate measurements and predictions possible about nature.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">DNA analysis, widely considered a more trustworthy forensic tool, played a huge role in revealing the unreliability of methods that are not scientifically grounded. After many convictions were overturned because of DNA testing, the U.S. Department of Justice established the NCFS to examine the problems with other forensic methods.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">“The purpose of the National Commission of Forensic Science was to bring together many different stakeholders to improve and enhance the reliability of forensic science,” said Sunita Sah, assistant professor of management and organizations at Cornell and one of the coauthors of the piece. This issue of forensic validity has garnered interest following the DOJ’s 2017 decision to close down the NCFS. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite the shutdown of the NCFS, academic scientists are still advocating for changes in the way forensic tools are applied in the justice system. “I’d like to see that the evidence that is brought into the courtroom has been validated, and the only way to do that is for the methods to be reviewed, tested and reaching a certain standard in order to be allowed in the courtroom,” Sah said. “All the standards of mainstream science should be applied to forensic science.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Review of forensic evidence before it enters the courtroom could significantly lengthen courtroom processes, Sah said, “but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With our current system emphasizing historical precedent instead of reliable scientific methods like DNA analysis, “innocent people are going to jail,” Albright said. “This is a real problem, and in order for us to live in a civil and just society, we need to fix this.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The night before their satellite was launched into space aboard a NASA rocket, past and present members of Brown Space Engineering gathered to celebrate the last seven years with a cookout, said Anand Lalwani ’18, leader of the group’s team in charge of solar power and battery construction. The launch was both exciting and bittersweet for the team, marking the culmination of thousands of hours of work by hundreds of students, he said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience was nerve-wracking at the same time, as the team was not sure if the rocket would actually launch, said Max Monn GS, one of the project’s founders who also worked on manufacturing and flash for the team. Storms had already pushed the launch back, said Hunter Ray ’18, the projects manager. Many of the group’s leaders said there was a one sixth chance of the rocket taking off, said Noah Joseph ’18, the computer aided design lead.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Their fears were alleviated six seconds after 4:44 a.m. last Monday, when the rocket carrying BSE’s satellite — named EQUiSat — successfully began its ascent toward space, said Manav Kohli ’18, the avionics hardware lead. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Team members watched the launch four miles from the launch site on Wallops Island, Virginia. Locals and visitors from other states joined the team to witness the event, Joseph said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling the launch “spectacular” would be an understatement, Kohli said. “The whole sky lit up orange. It was beautiful,” Joseph said. “The thing that you miss a lot when you watch a launch on a video is … the sound. You don't get how it feels. You can feel the rocket physically because of how loud it is,” Kohli said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It took about 10 seconds for the rocket to disappear from view, Kohli said. The team celebrated with champagne, Lalwani said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">EQUiSat will arrive at the International Space Station Thursday, Monn said. From there, it will be launched at some point between late June and early August and will remain in space for a year and a half, Monn said. The satellite was planned to test lithium iron batteries, which are somewhat uncommon in spacecrafts, </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/21/equisat-launch-space-may-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Herald previously reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The months leading up to the launch were “hectic but exciting,” Joseph said. The bulk of the final work took place between the beginning of the spring semester and March 21, when the satellite was handed off for launch, Kohli said. Some members were still making last-minute adjustments before the launch, such as coding updates for the website to ensure that the countdown timer ran correctly, said Hannah Varner ’14. Even after the satellite is deployed and begins operations, students will undertake major efforts to ensure that the team will be able to communicate with it, Monn said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The team faced many challenges in creating the EQUiSat — not least the fact that their leadership is completely composed of students, Lalwani said. “None of us had built a satellite before, or anything like it,” he said. Revealing how accessible space can be was also an important part of the project, Kohli said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The project shows that space engineering is not far out of reach for space enthusiasts, </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/13/engineering-undergraduates-launch-satellite-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Herald previously reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The EQUiSat was comparatively inexpensive to build, made for only $3,776, Ray said. If people want to make a satellite of their own, they can visit the BSE website to see exactly how it was created. EQUiSat will also be trackable from space and is even equipped with an LED light so people can see it from Earth, Varner said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students could join BSE to work on the satellite the first day of their freshman year, Kohli said. Zach Nado ’16 joined the team as a sophomore after his curiosity was piqued by a poster in Barus and Holley. At the time, BSE had recently received the launch contract with NASA, so the project had quickly turned from a fun hypothetical into something more concrete, he said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brant Hoffman ’15 was initially drawn to the difficulty of the engineering problem that the project posed. When he joined, he found a family and community that ultimately kept him involved.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">BSE is now working on a number of other projects. The tentatively-named “FutureSat,” the next satellite the team has planned, is still in the brainstorming phase, Joseph said. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Adderall shows adverse effects in students without ADHD</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/05/adderall-shows-adverse-effects-students-without-adhd/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Many college students in the United States abuse prescription ADHD medications with the belief that they can improve focus and cognition to achieve academic success. The results of recent research, however, suggest that these medications — specifically Adderall — either have a negative or nonexistent effect on performance in a number of brain processes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study, published in Pharmacology, looked at the performance of “healthy” college students — students with no attention or major medical disorders — who took both Adderall and a placebo at different times, said Lisa Weyandt, professor of psychology at the University of Rhode Island and co-lead author of the study. The study was conducted with 13 participants who were given 30 mg of Adderall — a common dosage that college students take — and took tests to measure performance on and off the drug, said Tara White, assistant professor of behavioral and social sciences and co-lead author of the study. Participants’ results with the drug were compared with their results without the drug to control for any factors that could affect differences in performance, said Bergljot Gudmundsdottir, a researcher who worked on the study.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team initially hypothesized that the drug would increase performance in these students. “What we found was that the results were mixed — if anything, they point to the opposite,” Gudmundsdottir said. The team was surprised to find that the drug did not enhance healthy students’ cognition, which is the primary reason college students take the drug in the first place, Weyandt said. Cognitive processes such as reading comprehension, the ability to maintain attention over time and the inhibition of impulses were unaffected by Adderall, while working memory was negatively affected, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, Adderall did increase the students’ alertness because it is a stimulant like coffee and energy drinks, Weyandt said. The students also reported feeling happier than they did on the placebo, White said. Physiologically, the drugs increased cardiovascular and central nervous system activity, White added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The increase in happiness, as well as the commonly held belief that the drugs improve cognitive performance, are most likely the driving reasons behind their prevalence on college campuses, Weyandt said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While research has shown that the abilities to maintain attention and inhibit impulses improve when students with ADHD take Aderall, students without ADHD do not experience the same effects, she said. “An analogy I sometimes use is if you wear glasses or corrective lenses. If someone … doesn’t have a visual impairment, and they put on your glasses, that’s not going to enhance their vision – in fact, it makes things blurrier,” Weyandt added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In her other research, Weyandt estimated that anywhere from 5 to 35 percent of college students are abusing these prescription drugs. College students who have lower GPAs and worse study skills and experience more psychological distress have an increased risk of abusing these medications, Weyandt said. Given that the medication does increase alertness and happiness, as well as act as an appetite suppressant, it can be an attractive option for some students, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Students who abuse these drugs are placing themselves at a greater risk for other health issues, such as cardiac conditions, Weyandt said. Society should pay attention to the dangers of misusing them, Gudmundsdottir said. “It’s a public health issue that we all need to be aware of to mitigate,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Weyandt’s takeaway is that students should seek out their university’s resources for long-term solutions rather than resorting to pills for a short-term fix. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study is significant because it helps to dispel an “urban myth” regarding drugs like Adderall and their effects on healthy college students, said Edward Walsh, assistant professor of neuroscience, who was unaffiliated with the study. “Abuse of Adderall in the hopes of getting some kind of cognitive advantage of cognition is really a very dangerous thing,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Weyandt stressed that this is a pilot study intended to lead to further research and should be replicated with a larger sample. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On Aug. 22, the University published a press release on the first-ever research <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330">study</a> to investigate “rapid-onset gender dysphoria,” which was authored by Lisa Littman, assistant professor of the practice of behavioral and social sciences in the School of Public Health. Littman’s study proposed that online forums and social media have allowed transgender identities to spread among adolescents in a manner dubbed “social contagion.” Five days later, PloS ONE, the peer-reviewed journal which published the study, posted a comment on the online paper indicating that the journal would “seek further expert assessment on the study’s methodology and analyses.” The same day, Aug. 27, Brown removed the press release highlighting Littman’s findings from its website and news distribution.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The following day, Dean of the School of Public Health Bess Marcus issued a <a href="http://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/08/gender">letter</a> affirming the School’s commitment to both academic freedom and the well-being of sexual and gender minority populations. A recent petition supporting Littman’s research and calling on both Brown and PloS ONE to “resist ideologically-based attempts to squelch controversial research evidence” has garnered 3,926 signatures, as of press time.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>Methodology and data collection</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gender dysphoria is defined by the American Psychiatric Association as a conflict between a person’s physical or assigned gender and the gender with which they identify. Littman’s study defined a new form of this phenomenon, “rapid-onset gender dysphoria,” which takes place when “gender dysphoria is observed to begin suddenly during or after puberty in an adolescent or young adult who would not have met criteria for gender dysphoria in childhood.” In the study, Littman gathered data by posting a survey that asked parents about their transgender teens on three parenting websites focused on transgender adolescents.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Littman declined a request for comment.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The three websites (that Littman posted to) all have ties (to) organizations and people that promote conversion therapy and reject gender identity,” wrote Brynn Tannehill, who has written widely about transgender experiences, including her own, in a follow-up email to The Herald. “The fact that she did not acknowledge the bias of these websites, and the effects that this would have on the data, clearly distorts whatever conclusions you may find. That’s flat-out bad research,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Multiple other experts interviewed for this article agreed with Tannehill, adding that it was unfair to draw conclusions about transgender adolescents and their experiences based on parent experiences.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The data is not presented as parents’ thoughts, feelings and perceptions of youth experience, but is extrapolated to ‘this is what happened to these youth, this is their experience,’” said Michelle Forcier, professor of pediatrics and clinician educator. “Anyone who has kids or takes care of kids knows that parent perception doesn’t accurately tell you what that adolescent’s experience is.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anne Fausto-Sterling, professor emeritus of biology, claimed that this research was a beginning point rather than an endpoint.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Frankly, it’s disingenuous to attack the method when (Littman) is the first person to even try to figure out what’s going on,” she said. “I don’t think the study does any more than say this is something we need to look at.”</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Accounting for transgender experiences </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some experts do not believe Littman is exploring a new circumstance at all. Adolescents commonly show little to no sign of gender dysphoria prior to puberty, Forcier said. “The physical changes of puberty mean you can’t just live in this androgynous place where everyone looks the same, but that doesn’t discount their early experience or their timing for seeking gender-affirming treatment.” Forcier has seen patients coming out in their forties, fifties and sixties, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many adolescents hide their gender identities from unsupportive parents until they no longer feel that they can, multiple experts noted. The stigmas surrounding transgender people can be incredibly isolating in many sociocultural situations, Forcier said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“That’s what rapid onset is actually describing — the parents finding out rapidly,” said Katie Chung MD’20, who studies LGBTQ health care and advocacy.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Are we witnessing a new phenomenon, or are we witnessing the same old phenomenon that we would see in any transgender kid in an unsupportive home?” Tannehill asked. “Littman is describing something already very well understood, but she’s trying to put a ‘scientific’ veneer on rejecting the identity of trans youth.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It should come as no surprise that transgender teens use online forums to discuss their identities, Tannehill said. “We know that there are not a lot of trans people, especially trans youth. It was a 50-minute drive for me to find another trans person that was out,” she said. “Where else are you going to find a trans community but online?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suggesting that transgender identities spread through social contagion is not only invalid, but harmful to an already vulnerable population, said Julia Serano, an author who has written extensively on transgender experiences, including her own.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This idea has been used by many parents and by some practitioners to isolate trans children from trans peers, from resources related to trans people and from treatment,” Serano said. “If you say that (being) transgender is contagious, what effect will that have on trans children?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Such framing and wording used throughout the study is incredibly dangerous, making gender dysphoria sound like “some weird pandemic,” Chung said. “It can only serve to further marginalize this population.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“If one doesn’t do a semi-rigorous analysis of the methodology, the headline of this study will be used to question people’s experience of their body and their identity and adolescents’ ability to assert their identity,” said Georgia Lipkin MD’21, who studies LGBTQ health care and advocacy. “This is gatekeeping by another name, and I think it’s going to do a lot of damage,” they added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many of the experts interviewed agreed that the study’s conclusions have harsh implications for the safety of transgender youth. Transgender adolescents who are not listened to or supported are more prone to a host of mental health issues that have historically been brought on by the stress of holding a marginalized identity, Forcier said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3"><b>Academic freedom and scientific responsibility </b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Fausto-Sterling, however, worries that shutting down Littman’s research has its own consequences. She believes the University and PLoS ONE journal have been treating Littman unfairly.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The University claims to support free speech, Fausto-Sterling said. “I’m not convinced they’re doing it.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The research study, the University’s promotion of it and the subsequent removal of the associated press release were covered by a wide variety of news sources. While some of these, such as Slate Magazine, argued Littman’s methods and conclusions were flawed, others such as Fox News critiqued the University’s decision to remove the press release.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The choice to take down the press release was not a result of the Univerity taking a side, but rather from PLoS ONE’s own comment raising questions about the research design and methodology, said Cass Cliatt, vice president for communications. At this point, the University believes it is the “responsible thing to halt the distribution of our news of that research as those questions are assessed,” she wrote in a follow-up email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The approval of research for this project was provided by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Thus, the study went through a human studies board and office of research integrity independent of the University, Marcus said.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“We very much support our students and we very much support the transgender community, and we also very much support academic freedom and rigorous debate in our faculty. We don’t see those as at odds,” Marcus said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Members of the Brown community have expressed feeling personally affected by the study. “I feel really worked up in a way that I don’t often feel about science. It’s dangerous when science pretends to be neutral and it isn’t, and I think that’s when it does a lot of harm,” Lipkin said. “This study repeats a lot of dangerous narratives around trans identity that I thought we had moved past.”</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">During the second week of August, the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics hosted GirlsGetMath@ICERM, a week-long day camp for girls in the Providence area entering 10th or 11th grade. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The program started in 2014 under then-director of ICERM Jill Pipher, the University’s current vice president for research. The program has continued annually, offering 20 to 25 girls the opportunity to work together on interactive math and computer science activities and attend lectures. </span></p>
<p class="p4">“What I absolutely love about the GirlsGetMath program … is that it takes a diverse group of females from around the state, puts them in a room and empowers them to get excited about these very marketable skill sets including mathematics, computer science and cryptography,” said Nicholas Bousquet, a computer science and mathematics teacher at Scituate Senior High School in North Scituate, Rhode Island. Two students from his school attended GirlsGetMath@ICERM this summer.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">T</span>he camp was offered to students at a cost of $100 for the week, but full scholarships were available, said Ruth Crane, the assistant director of ICERM. The students’ tuition does not cover every expense of the program — funding is gift and grant-based. In the past, funding has come from a wide array of organizations such as the American Mathematical Society, Math for America, Microsoft Research and others. These types of donations allow the program to run at high quality with a lower fina<span class="s3">ncial burden on the students and their families.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There is clear evidence that even though jobs in STEM are growing very rapidly and they pay better than a lot of other jobs, women are very underrepresented in these careers,” said Katharine Ott, one of the program’s organizers and an associate professor of mathematics at Bates College.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At a young age, girls start feeling that boys may be better at math and science, said Amalia Culiuc, another one of the program’s organizers and an assistant professor of mathematics at Amherst College. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The camp also aimed to change stereotypes around STEM. “There’s an image in the media of math being a lonely activity,” said Brendan Hassett, the director of ICERM. However, when all of the participants are together learning new math concepts at the camp, “it makes it very easy to see how math can be something that can be really exciting,” he said. “The energy is infectious.” Many events at ICERM function to foster collaboration between professional mathematicians. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the advantages of hosting the program at ICERM was that the girls had exposure to scientists in a range of programs, Culiuc said. This year, the Data Science Initiative hosted the TRIPODS Summer Bootcamp at ICERM, a program that brought together professionals in machine learning. The concurrence of the events gave the girls the chance to ask visiting speakers and participants about their careers. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“One of the goals is to give the group of high school women exposure to mathematics that they don’t see during their regular high school classes,” Ott said. She added that the program this year covered “probability, graph theory with applications to biology, data science, cryptography and image processing.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some of the activities were driven by the interests of certain professors on campus, Hassett said. For example, Professor of Engineering and Computer Science Pedro Felzenszwalb helped collaborate on the 3D printing unit for the camp. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beyond GirlsGetMath, ICERM has hosted other events that follow a similar model as part of their aim to facilitate collaboration and camaraderie between woman-identifying mathematicians at different stages in their careers, Hassett said. One such program was the Women in Data Science and Mathematics Research Collaboration, which took place in July of 2017. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some high school students may not realize how important math is to their career goals, and the program helped keep that door open for the students, Ott said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starting this year, the week-long curriculum was made available by request to other teachers and educators across the nation, Crane said. The hope is that the program will be carried to other institutions beyond the University. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Already, “there is a satellite program functioning at the University of Rochester,” Culiuc said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New CS prof starts machine learning lab</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/06/new-cs-prof-starts-machine-learning-lab/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">As computer science students flood into the newly-renovated CIT, they will be joined by Stephen Bach, an assistant professor who joined the department this semester. Bach’s hiring comes at a time when the discipline of computer science is exploding at Brown — both in terms of class enrollment and research. For the second year in a row, computer science was the most popular concentration at the University, conferring a total of 184 degrees in 2018, 9 percent of all degrees awarded.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bach researches and teaches machine learning, a field of computer science that aims to detect patterns in large sets of data. Current techniques in this area require massive amounts of labeled data, limiting machine learning’s spread to companies and individuals who can afford to develop this necessary component. But Bach is working to change that. By automating the process of labeling data, he hopes to democratize machine learning and make it easier to apply it to fields such as health care and spam filtering, he said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bach is in the process of starting his new research lab and has secured start-up funding from the department for a year. He has begun collaborating with other professors in the department to secure funding as he will soon have to rely on outside grants and sources to keep his lab afloat. With Professor and Associate Chair of Computer Science Michael Littman, Professor of Computer Science Eli Upfal and Assistant Professor of Computer Science James Tompkin, Bach is applying for a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency grant as part of the agency’s “Learning with Less Labels” program. The program hopes to decrease the amount of labeled data required by a million-fold, a significant change from the current state-of-the-art techniques, according to a DARPA press release. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bach joins the University after serving as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. While there, Bach helped develop a tool called Snorkel, which greatly reduces the amount of time required to label data. Bryan He, a PhD student at Stanford who worked closely with Bach as part of Snorkel, said that Bach helped him put together “one of the most organized” research projects he had ever been a part of. Bach also served as a visiting scholar at Google this year. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Excited about the prospect of mentoring students in his lab, Bach has already begun reaching out to undergraduates and graduates to join him. In addition, he will sit on the graduate admissions committee for the department this year, hoping to pull PhD students into his work. His advisee, Shiying Luo GS, said she is excited to work with Bach, describing his patience and interesting research as enticing. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bach will teach two courses during his first year at Brown. In the fall, he will run CSCI 2952C: “Learning with Limited Labeled Data,” a graduate seminar that focuses on much of the work Bach has researched over the last few years. In the spring, he will take on CSCI 1420: “Machine Learning,” an introductory course to the field that has seen enrollment skyrocket in the last few years. In fall 2013, the course had just 51 students; last spring, that number reached more than 250. Expected enrollment in spring 2018 is greater than 300 students, wrote Ugur Cetintemel, professor and department chair of computer science, in an email to The Herald. While teaching such a large class requires overcoming logistical problems from classroom space to grading, Cetintemel believes Bach is prepared for the challenge. “He has an excellent mentorship record and a student-centered perspective on teaching, and he is highly collaborative,” he wrote. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bach is one of several professors to join the department this year, alongside new faculty members such as Assistant Professors Ellie Pavlick and Tim Nelson. The intensive hiring in computer science is reflective of the growth of enrollment and research in the department. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Neurosurgeons could one day thank Ollin Venegas’ MD’20<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>presentation to high school students for allowing them to create detailed brain models of their patients. Venegas has been developing 3D models of the human brain, aiming to provide an educational tool and tactile illustration of the effects of concussions and other head traumas. Working alongside Zak Ziebell ’19, a RISD dual-degree student, Patrick Rashleigh, a data visualization coordinator for the University and other group members, Venegas has created a model that shows both the internal and external impacts of head injuries. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Venegas has been interested in head trauma and its effects from a young age. He began the project to illustrate trauma in a presentation he gave last summer to high school students. By encasing a ballistic gel solution in a mold and placing the model brain in a skull, Venegas was able to illustrate the damage to neurons and other internal workings of the brain when trauma occurs. The model served as a means to illustrate “what happens to the brain when you can’t see (it), ” Venegas said. His model is also cheaper than alternatives and highlights head injuries in innovative ways, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Venegas later approached Rashleigh to begin work on creating a more simplified mold. “It’s always exciting when someone walks in with a project with a concrete plan on how the 3D printer is going to be used for a practical purpose,” Rashleigh said. A physical model brings out certain aspects a digital one cannot, he added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“(It has) been demonstrated time and time again that there are benefits to having something exist in a physical space and be tactile.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Venegas turned his efforts toward creating a more accurate model with Rashleigh and Ziebell, who both work in the Rockefeller Library Digital Studio. The accessibility and cheaper cost of 3D printers compared to other mediums made the technology an exciting option to create the model, Venegas said. Using the RISD Nature Lab, the group first used a human skull as a model template to create the 3D-printed brain and eventually improved it by using a real human brain from a cadaver. “It’s way more impactful if you see something … you get a real sense of what’s going on in your skull when you hit your head,” Ziebell said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ziebell and Venegas spent an arduous two hours preparing the human brain for scans by removing the membrane with careful precision, Ziebell said. The sight of an actual human brain shocked Ziebell at first and provided quite the scare for the Nature Lab faculty and a nearby tour group that happened to see it, he added. “I’ve studied the brain on a theoretical level,” Zeibel said, but after 10 minutes of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“just holding it and looking at it,” he found himself thinking “someone was inside of that in some sort of way.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Following the model’s completion, the printed brain could be thrown and hit to show the kinetic effects and dyed to show internal damage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most people think that a concussion is “as simple as knocking your head and your brain jostling around,” Venegas said, but having the model show the real effects will help educate the public.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The group hopes the model can find a wide range of applications, from increasing public awareness to neurosurgery training, Venegas said. Furthermore, he hopes to see the model used for patients about to enter surgery. Neurosurgeons will hopefully be informed of precise injuries or abnormalities the patient has through a physical model. “You can see a broken leg, you can see a broken foot, but you can’t really see severed neuronal connections and what that means,” Venegas added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Venegas is currently working to improve the model by using plastic material to make the model cheaper and more accessible to other groups and organizations. Additionally, he is aiming to add another layer to the brain to increase the model’s detail. He plans to eventually create a curriculum based on his previous presentation on trauma and create a universal lesson plan that can be picked up and used by other schools, groups and presenters. Venegas and his group are also actively seeking partnerships and collaborations to advance their project.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A new study by University researchers confirmed that it is possible for household lead levels to be reduced more substantially than the Environmental Protection Agency currently mandates. The study follows Providence Water’s 2017 annual report, which revealed that Providence’s water exceeds the lead level guidelines set by the EPA. The University is currently testing water<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>samples from campus buildings to see if they exceed EPA standards for drinking water for the first time since 2008, according to Director of Environmental Health and Safety Stephen Morin. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>University study on household lead levels</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Published in JAMA Pediatrics Aug. 27, the new study looked at 355 pregnant women and their children in Cincinnati from 2003 to the present. The research team implemented lead remediation techniques in the homes of about half of the women — including removing and replacing chipped lead paint and lead-painted window sills, installing lead-removing water filters and covering lead-contaminated soil with groundcover. The other half, the control group, received baby gates and injury prevention devices to prevent infants from direct exposure to lead. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">While the researchers were unable to find a significant difference in blood lead levels among the wider group that received lead remediation intervention, there was a 31 percent reduction in lead levels among black children. Joseph Braun, associate professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health and lead author of the study, is unsure why black children saw the largest improvement after treatment. Because black children are often exposed to a higher level of lead, the preventative measures may have made a larger impact, he said. Braun added that he is interested in conducting additional research about the relationship between income and lead exposure.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">The study could help push the EPA to strengthen their guidelines for household lead levels, as it showed that achieving lower lead levels is possible, Braun said.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In addition to blood testing, the study looked at children’s behavior from one to eight years old. The only significant behavioral improvement between the control and treatment groups was a reduction in anxiety, Braun said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Going forward, Braun said he would like to examine which types of remediation are most effective in reducing lead levels and explore the difference between lead exposure from water compared to dust.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Lead in Rhode Island</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In Rhode Island, lead from dust and water are perennial issues. According to the Rhode Island Department of Health, 80 percent of homes in the state were built before 1978 and therefore contain a high level of lead paint. The state has exceeded the EPA’s recommended lead levels in the water “10 times or more” in the last 25 years, the Associated Press reported. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In the last decade, Providence Water has spent over $45 million mitigating lead damage, according to an Aug. 31 press release from the city utility company.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Providence Water continues to evaluate our water treatment process to make the water less corrosive in an effort to reduce lead levels in homes that may have lead plumbing,” the statement read.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In Providence, both the 2016 and 2017 water quality reports showed lead exceedances above the EPA standards.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“It’s disturbing, but not at all surprising,” said Laura Brion ’04, executive director of Childhood Lead Action Project.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Brion, who advocates for lead safety in the state, said that Providence Water recently notified her that her office building in Federal Hill may have lead service lines. The Herald’s building at 195 Angell St. also received one of these notifications. Providence Water has placed the report in public locations, including the Sciences Library. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“I’m glad that Providence is reporting it out and that people are noticing it,” Brion said. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Providence Water’s brochures and letters, written in English and Spanish, encourage Providence Water customers to stop by their offices to pick up free water-testing kits. The literature also describes Providence Water’s no-interest, three-year loan program that provides loans for homeowners to replace private lead pipes with the guarantee that the company will replace the public lines.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3"><b>Looking Forward</b></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">While headlines about lead, including those about Flint, Michigan, can ignite public concern, a lot has already been done to lower lead exposure, according to David Savitz, associate director of the Brown Center for the Study of Children at Risk and professor of epidemiology, pediatrics and obstetrics and gynecology.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“Levels that we’re concerned about (now), 10 years ago, we would have been happy about,” Savitz said, adding that with regulations such as removing lead from gasoline, the EPA has been able to gradually lower lead levels and make lead guidelines stricter.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“They set standards to be practical,” Savitz said, adding that no level of lead is known to be safe.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Interventions usually make subtler differences because lead levels are already generally much lower than before, he said, pointing to the study’s findings that black participants benefitted most from the remediation techniques while the group as a whole did not show significant reduction in blood lead levels. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">But lead levels can always be lower, Savitz said, adding that Providence Water “certainly needs to lower levels to be in compliance” with EPA regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">Still, Savitz urged people not to panic about general low-level lead exposures in the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">“We’re concerned (about lead levels), not conveying a sense of terror,” he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Smart pillow talks to users, improves sleep</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Restless nights spent tossing and turning may soon be a thing of the past. Together with a team of undergraduates and CS faculty, Tiffany Chen ’18 created a smart pillow that can read users’ sleep patterns and give recommendations for improvement. With ongoing work from Jiaju Ma ’21, a RISD dual degree student, the pillow is improving its accuracy and expanding its capabilities.</p>
<p class="p2">The project began last fall, when Chen arrived on campus inspired by a summer spent interning at Microsoft and began planning a senior thesis with Assistant Professor of Computer Science Jeff Huang. With other members of Huang’s research group, Chen delved into the idea of personal fabrication, making everyday products that adapt to different users’ needs and environments.</p>
<p class="p2">Chen’s early ideas were based on the notion of inclusive design and were particularly inspired by a personal experience — getting a piercing on her right ear and being directed not to sleep on that side as it healed. She thought that if a smart sleep device could help her in that moment, it might be able to help others who experience different sleep impediments, including sleep apnea and other conditions.</p>
<p class="p2">While sleep-tracking devices exist — smartphones and Fitbits, for example — the group believed that these technologies may not monitor all aspects of sleep as seamlessly as something within the bed could. “We settled on a pillow … there’s enough cushion in there that we could put some sensors inside,” Huang said. Additionally, the pillow concept would allow them to combine different tracking devices such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and even pressure sensors. The team hoped that the pillow would be able to recognize whether a user typically slept on their side or back, for example, and then to “correlate that with when they wake up, how restful they feel,” he said.</p>
<p class="p2">After coming up with this concept, the team needed to design a way by which users could gather data from the pillow and receive the pillow’s recommendations. The answer was not a screen. “It’s not a good idea to be using computers before bed … the light makes it harder to fall asleep,” Huang said. Chen then did research to figure out the best way for users to interact with the device, ultimately deciding on voice user interface as the best approach. The interaction with a voice UI<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>also allows the sleeper using the pillow to “calibrate” it by declaring when they are on their back or side. After this calibration, the pillow can learn on its own and track which position the user is in even when they are sleeping, Huang said.</p>
<p class="p2">The team used Botsociety, a tool that enables the creation of conversational scenarios that arise between a user and device, to diagram out what pillowtalk between the user and the pillow would be like, she said.</p>
<p class="p2">While making the prototype of the pillow, Chen said she relied on skills she had learned in her computer science and introductory engineering classes at the University. Though she didn’t end up pursuing an engineering degree, the intro classes she took taught her about building the circuits that now underlie the team’s pillow. She added that the key to the success of her project was “trial and error” and “a lot of good mentorship in the CS department.”</p>
<p class="p2">Chen graduated in the spring with degrees in Computer Science and Economics, but the pillow project will be continued by Ma, who studies industrial design and computer science. Ma received an Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award to work on the project this summer and will continue his involvement throughout the school year, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">This summer, Ma worked to improve the prototype by building a sensor pad to cover the surface of the pillow, connecting it to the sleep recommendation engine and making the whole system more portable. His work allows the pillow to more accurately read the users’ movements and position, suggest sleep changes and then follow up to see if those recommendations helped improve sleep.</p>
<p class="p2">The group hopes to have a singular sleep recommendation engine that can be used in a variety of ways through different devices, Huang said. Currently, the group has an app on the Google Play store called “SleepCoacher” which can be integrated with the pillow or used as a standalone app.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are still working on bringing their program to iOS.</p>
<p class="p2">Overall, the intention of the project is focused on “finding insights about human technology interaction versus creating something we can monetize,” Chen said.</p>
<p class="p2">“Our goal is just to have as many people use it as we can,” Huang said, adding that “we want to make something that anyone can make or get cheaply.”</p>
<p class="p2">In the future, the team plans to enter its work into the computer science research symposium“User Interface Software and Technology” and further develop the capabilities of the pillow itself, Ma said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Since its successful launch and deployment earlier this year, the Brown Space Engineering’s EQUiSat cube satellite has been continuously transmitting information down to Providence. A team of students at BSE has been collaborating on the project since its conception nearly eight years ago. As the team receives and records data from EQUiSat, BSE is already in the preliminary stages of preparing their next big cube satellite project, which is tentatively set for mid-2021, said current Project Manager Jacob Leiken ’20.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Due to its lengthy and, at times, arduous construction, seeing the satellite’s launch has made the ever-growing list of team members proud of their project. Hunter Ray ’17, the project’s former team manager, was tasked with delivering EQUiSat to Houston to prepare for its launch and deployment this summer. “I was a little nervous having to hold onto it. … I got some funny looks on the airplane,” Ray said. In Houston, EQUiSat underwent final tests and was loaded for launch. Ray met other BSE alums to watch the launch. EQUiSat was launched around 4:40 a.m. May 21 and was deployed into orbit July 13. “It was pretty exciting not only for us to see how far we’ve come but for (the alums) to see their dream become a reality,” Ray said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As intended, the satellite passes over Providence about twice a day. “That’s the mission … the primary (goal) is to get people excited about it and try to show people the flash” of the satellite’s LEDs, said McKenna Cisler ’20, technical lead of the team. But its current orbit has been taking the satellite over Providence during the daytime, making it invisible to people on the ground, Leiken said. Though no one has seen EQUiSat’s flash yet, as it orbits around the Earth, the times during which it will pass over Providence will gradually enter the night, allowing its flash to be fully visible, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">EQUiSat’s initial project of testing the potential of lithium iron phosphate batteries to be used in spacecraft has seen success in its mission. The batteries, which power the satellite’s LEDs, have shown that they can function in the harsh conditions of space. “We’ve also been getting data that confirms that they are charging and discharging normally, handle the cold temperature well and don’t get too hot or fail to dissipate heat when providing a lot of current to the LEDs,” Cisler wrote in a follow-up email to The Herald.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">BSE is currently working on improving the ability of its ground stations to receive and analyze transmissions from EQUiSat, Ray said. There are currently two stations, with one currently in Rome and another in construction on top of Barus and Holley, Leiken said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">EQUiSat currently has a <a href="http://equisat.brownspace.org/">web app</a> and a mobile app that display its current location, allow users to interact with a model of the satellite and provide a complete history of its transmissions. Notifications can also update users whenever EQUiSat is over their current position, Leiken said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The team has received positive feedback from the ham radio community, which isable to pick up EQUiSat’s transmissions from around the world as it passes by. Transmissions have even been received in Saudi Arabia, Leiken added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The satellite is also being used by the team as a symbol for the BSE outreach program. BSE plans to teach younger students about space engineering and use EQUiSat as an educational tool to illustrate scientific concepts such as magnetic fields, Cisler said. The team is working on lesson plans and hopes to create an after-school program for further outreach. “Space is accessible: We built this, you can look up and see the stuff in space; it’s easily done,” Cisler said. Leiken added that many children dream of being astronauts when they grow up but may abandon that dream due to the lengthy and grueling process. BSE’s success shows that people can have a connection to space without having to go into space, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While BSE still has time to collect and analyze data from EQUiSat before it burns up in the atmosphere, the team has already begun construction on its next satellite and is brainstorming ideas for its new focal point of research, Cisler said. One of the ideas being discussed is the implementation of a robotic arm with a camera that could lead BSE to build an aptly named “SelfieSat”, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We put one of the cheapest satellites in orbit. … We’ve already had a ton of mission success,” Cisler said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Polyploidal cancer cells, also known as giant cancer cells, have been brought into the spotlight as new research suggests their previously unknown involvement in cancer development and remission.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Researchers found that normal cancer treatments led to an increase in these giant cancer cells, and this prompted research into exactly what their function was, said Michelle Dawson, assistant professor of molecular pharmacology, physiology and biotechnology.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Other people have looked at polyploidal cells before, but most clinicians had viewed them as “dead-end cells” as they do not undergo mitosis, Dawson said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A polyploidal cancer cell, which is 10 times the size of a normal cancer cell, has multiple chromosomal copies, Dawson said. The giant cell undergoes amitotic budding, when it splits and produces a “normal” cancer cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. So, if there are more giant cells, this can cause cancer cells to proliferate, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“These cells are present in more aggressive types of cancer tumors,” said Deepraj Ghosh, postdoctoral research associate in Dawson’s lab. “They have been more resistant to chemotherapy drugs and act like a cancer stem cell, giving rise to a higher population of cancer cells, making them harder to treat,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It turns out that within a cancer cell population there are 1 to 2 percent of these giant polyploidal cells that exist,” Dawson said. If cancer is treated with common chemotherapy, such as Taxol or radiation, the number of giant cancer cells increases to between 20 and 90 percent, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We have looked at breast and ovarian cancer, and the amount of polyploidal cells varies initially, but treatment is what gives rise to five to 10 times more of these cells,” said Botai Xuan, a PhD candidate in the lab.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Another problem is that there are so many cells in tissues that the likelihood of finding the 1 percent of cells that are polyploidal is not high, Dawson said. It’s only during late-stage cancer or after treatment that there is an observable amount of these cells.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Polyploidal cancer cells form through endoreplication, a defective form of mitosis, where the cell clumps up rather than separating normally, Dawson said. They also form through “cell fusion,” where smaller normal cancer cells group together. Cell fusion increases substanitally when cancer is treated with high-dose Taxol, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Literature shows that these giant polyploidal cells survive after treatment, which increases production of non-polyploidal cells that can “restart” the tumor, Xuan said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even though the focus has been on breast and ovarian cancer, polyploidal cancer types do not seem limited to specific cancers, Dawson said, adding that more research is needed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The difference between normal and giant cancer cells can be better understood through the tortoise and the hare analogy, Dawson said. “(The smaller normal cancer cells) can move around pretty fast, but they cannot move directionally,” she said, while the giant cells have direct paths and can transport more cancer overall.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since there are multiple subtypes of cancer cells, including polyploidal cells, it is very difficult to treat an entire cancer population, Xuan said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By studying these giant cancer cells and their function, researchers can<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>improve treatments and have better diagnostics than those used in the past, said Benjamin Tang, assistant adjunct professor at the University of California at San Francisco.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“(We need to) isolate for these polyploidal cells, which would allow us to get a more in-depth understanding of the molecular composition of these cells,” Xuan said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s a very exciting study, as it explores aspects of specific cancer cells that we typically don’t look at,” Tang said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There are a few companies looking into using drug-loaded nanoparticles for cancer treatment, but more research is needed, Tang said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On Sept. 10, the submissions portal for the Hyundai Visionary Challenge opened exclusively to University students, alums and teaching faculty members. The competition centers around three main themes: biology-inspired mobility, digital phenotyping and human-machine partnerships, according to the HVC website. A prize of up to $45,000 will be split between at least three winning teams, and the winners will be offered the opportunity to secure up to $200,000 in additional research funding. Successful teams will also be invited to speak at a global conference on smart mobility in Silicon Valley. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This is the first time Hyundai Motor Company has brought the competition to the University. There is a mutually beneficial relationship between companies like Hyundai and the University, said Daniel Behr, executive director of the Office of Industry Engagement and Commercial Venturing. “Companies have needs for innovation and the University is always looking for new sources for research funding.” While most research funding comes from federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, companies have market-driven needs that require university-level research, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Hyundai and Brown have a natural affinity,” said Tracey Dodenhoff, business development consultant of the Office of Industry Engagement and Commercial Venturing. Youngcho Chi ’82 ScM’87 PhD’90 P’13’16, executive vice president of Hyundai Motor Group, helped initialize the relationship between Hyundai and the University, Dodenhoff said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both Dodenhoff and Behr stress that this competition is not about just cars but rather about smart mobility, hoping to attract proposals that expand beyond automobiles. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The three broad themes of the competition span diverse research interests. Taking inspiration from nature is the main goal of biologically-inspired mobility, Dodenhoff said. She cited the University’s ongoing study of bat flight as an example of research that looks into both the physics of flying and the bat’s sensory abilities. “There are rich opportunities to translate wisdom found in nature into solutions that can help us as human beings.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Digital phenotyping focuses on the interaction between transportation machines and humans. “If you think about a future where humans are being transported by autonomous machines, you can think about ways for those machines to interact and maybe help the human,” Behr said. For instance, the machine could sense if the human it is transporting is not feeling well or is exhibiting unfamiliar patterns, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The human-machine partnership emphasizes the way scientists can leverage technology to make tasks “better, safer, more pleasant and more reliable,” Dodenhoff said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Judges of the competition will hail from both the University and Hyundai, said Betsy Stubblefield Loucks, communications and business development associate of the Office of Industry Engagement and Commercial Venturing. “The judges are going to be looking for ideas that are really pushing the cutting edge of smart mobility and sustainability.” These innovative ideas are not necessarily ready for market right now but could ideally be put on the market in five years, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Teams have already begun entering the challenge. David Whitney GS is entering the competition with his team and hopes to focus on the human-machine partnership theme of the challenge. “What particularly interests me (about this competition) is the ability to see how research translates into production, … how it leaves the lab and enters a real company or factory like Hyundai,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to the HVC website, eligible teams must have a maximum of five University-affiliated members, at least one of whom must be an undergraduate or graduate researcher. The submission portal closes Oct. 15 and winners will be announced in November.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The existence of ice on the moon’s surface has been a source of intrigue for astronomers since the 1950s. In August, an elusive search for direct evidence finally came to an end when a team of researchers made a definitive discovery of water ice on the moon’s surface in areas known as “permanently shadowed regions,” or PSRs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">“The people in the (scientific) community have tried so many times to detect ice, but they’ve not been able to definitively tell until our study,” said </span><span class="s3">Shuai Li, a researcher at the University of Hawaii and lead author of the study</span><span class="s4">.</span></p>
<p class="p4">The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used data from the moon Mineralogy Mapper, otherwise known as M3, which was launched in 2008 and administered by Carle Pieters, professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences. The M3 measures sunlight reflected off of materials, including water ice, on the moon’s surface, said Ralph Milliken, associate professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences and co-author of the study.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Li analyzed the M3 data in an attempt to better understand the PSRs. These regions do not receive direct sunlight throughout the year and drop to temperatures below 100 degrees Kelvin, which initially led researchers to theorize that stable water ice could form. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To circumvent the problem of examining dark regions through a light-dependent tool, Li examined only the edges of the PSRs. “Here you get enough light scattered from the surrounding eliminated terrain that you can just see into the shadows a little bit,” Milliken said. “That was kind of a novel approach.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Through numerous tests, Li showed that the light reflected in wavelengths resembled that of ice spectra. Then he performed tests to eliminate the possibility of background noise interfering, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Supportive discoveries for the PSR ice theory have previously been made on Mercury and Ceres, the biggest object in the asteroid belt, and stimulated a similar search on moon. However, a 2006 rover mission to the moon’s south pole concluded that there were no large amounts of water ice in that region, Li said. A neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector mission detected traces of hydrogen, but found inconclusive evidence as to whether these traces were part of molecular water. By 2015, data from the M3 and the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter showed evidence of hydrogen-containing materials in polar regions of the moon, yet did not prove that they were part of water, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Li and Milliken emphasized that the water ice detected lies only on the upper half-millimeter of the moon surface that they measured, exists just in the extremely cold, polar regions and resembles frost-like icy dirt. While further research needs to be done to examine the amount of water ice present under the moon’s surface, this study has pinpointed where the surface water ice is located, providing a road map for future missions, Milliken said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Surface water ice has many potential uses, Milliken said. It could be broken apart into hydrogen and used to refuel rovers or, in the future, even serve as a resource for humans.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The presence of water that can be used towards this exploration of the moon is a big step forward as a reason to return to the moon,” said Hannah Kaplan PhD’18, a researcher at Southwest Research Institute.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It also provides ample opportunities to explore how this water came to be on the moon — whether from comet and asteroid impacts or from the moon’s early days, Milliken said. The study also showed that future instruments could be better tailored to these kinds of difficult measurements, as Li’s analysis pushed the M3 to its limits, Milliken said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>FeldmanHall Lab demystifies human behavior</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Altruism, empathy and morality are typically thought of as abstract ideals, but Oriel FeldmanHall, assistant professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences, breaks these topics down scientifically. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In an effort to better understand human behavior, her lab studies concepts at the intersection of social psychology, behavioral economics and neuroscience.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">FeldmanHall’s team has studied topics such as the formation of empathy and morality, friendship development, social interactions and numerous others, FeldmanHall said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though the team picks topics of scientific interest, the concepts are also pertinent to the general population, not just the scientific community. Empathy and morality have broad appeal as individuals seek to improve themselves, said Joseph Heffner GS, a lab member. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Historically, topics like these have been thought of as immeasurable, but models of human behavior and cognition being developed by the team are seeking to overturn that long-held belief, said former Lab Manager Jae-Young Son GS. </span></p>
<p class="p2">For example, the lab devised <span class="s1">an experiment in which an individual must shock someone several times in order to keep a sum of money as a means of studying costly altruism — deciding whether or not to help someone if it costs you money — FeldmanHall said. This behavior is difficult to analyze, as it is hard to study experimentally, she added. By conducting an experiment with real world consequences, a hypothetical ideal can be scientifically tested. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lab also undertook a separate experiment analyzing costly punishment</span>: By observing <span class="s1">whether or not subjects intervened as a third party when they witnessed an individual wronging another person, the team identified reputation as the driving factor behind people’s actions, Heffner said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another study on empathy and networking showed that more often than not, people who exhibited more empathy were at the center of their respective social networks, said William Lee GS, a member of the lab. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A separate publication by the lab studied how degrees of uncertainty influence risk taking and decision-making pertaining to helping and trusting others, as uncertainty influences most social decisions, said Lab Manager Logan Bickel.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lab’s focus is rooted in FeldmanHall’s deep interest in the study of social psychology and behavior. “What could be better about waking up every morning, thinking about why humans do the things they do and trying to find the answer to those things?” she said. While the lab began two years ago with just FeldmanHall, she was quickly joined by Son and Heffner. The new lab began to grow and decided to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to its work, pulling from disparate literature and fields. “(It) speaks to how open-minded we all are and how eager we are to adopt state-of-the-art techniques,” Son said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lab maintains a culture in which argument is allowed and even encouraged, if it means promoting progress, Son said. “(The lab is) an open book, a blank slate. … We’re allowed to have scientific disagreements with one another but fashion them into productive and interesting debates about things that can move the field forward,” he added. The multidisciplinary approach fosters more well-rounded answers to the topics at hand, Bickel said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The lab has since grown to between 10 to 15 members, including undergraduates, and encourages an environment in which students from many disciplines come together to answer questions about social interactions, FeldmanHall said. “I think some of the best science happens on the fringes,” she added. “If you can cherry pick the beautiful things … from lots of different spaces and merge them together, then you can have a fruitful avenue forward.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“That’s the key to science,” Lee said. “If you surround yourself with people who have all sorts of ideas, you can test them and determine whose intuition is right.” A multidisciplinary approach may make things muddy at times due to contrasting viewpoints, but it forces everyone to break down information so that researchers from diverse disciplines can all add to the discussion. “We all have to speak the same language when we all don’t speak the same language,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The FeldmanHall lab is now conducting studies on political polarization and the influence of inequality on decision making, among other investigations. Their work on political polarization will examine the way people from different political backgrounds view the same footage. Lee’s upcoming thesis explores social foraging, a topic that analyzes people’s tendency to gauge the utility of social situations, such as when to leave their job or their romantic relationships, and what influences those decisions to be made earlier or later, he said. The team purposefully focuses on topics relevant to the public and encourages other researchers to consider how “their own areas of study can complement and also be informed by the work (we) are doing,” Son said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I feel very lucky that I have the lab that I do,” FeldmanHall said. “I am surrounded with people who are all much smarter than I am, and so I am continually learning from my students, and that is the greatest gift.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Matthew Sacchet ’10, a postdoctoral scholar from Stanford University, delivered a lecture at the School of Public Health Tuesday on “personalized mindfulness practices,” according to the event description.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sacchet began by pointing to a quote from Jon Kabat-Zinn, founding executive director of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, as a common definition of mindfulness: “paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sacchet added that he is “particularly interested in … moving beyond targeting psychiatric disorders and really trying to target specific individuals (and tailoring) mindfulness-based interventions for what that specific person needs.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There are several questions in the field that still need to be answered, Sacchet said. “What is the neuroscience of mindfulness?” he asked. “How can we leverage the insights of the neuroscience of mindfulness to develop more effective treatments?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In his lecture, Sacchet spoke about his research to better understand the brain structure and function of individuals with mood and anxiety disorders. His work may have applications in the field of mindfulness science.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While neuroscience has historically focused on the structure and function of specific brain regions, Sacchet said the field has recently shifted toward understanding how interactions between regions affect behavioral and psychological processes. Specifically, Sacchet aims to understand “how disruptions to these interactions might relate to psychopathology,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To explore this interest, Sacchet said he employed a variety of research methods, including diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, a technique that “allows an opportunity to investigate interregional (connections) non-invasively in humans.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In one study, Sacchet applied a modeling method called brain tractography to investigate the robustness of the uncinate fasciculus, a white matter bundle located in the prefrontal cortex, in individuals with mood and anxiety disorders to understand how “that relates to … emotion regulation techniques that they use.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">From his research, Sacchet said he found that individuals with depression who engaged in emotional suppression — or the act of inhibiting emotional behavior such as keeping a poker face instead of expressing sadness — had a more robust uncinate fasciculus.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Emotional suppression is significant because it is, in some ways, “the opposite of a mindful approach” and “the opposite of acceptance,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sacchet also discussed efforts to understand interregional interactions occurring in the brain through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging and identification of brain structures that show highly correlated activity. In his lecture, Sacchet spoke about his analyses on three brain networks: the control network, which is involved in planning and the inhibition of impulses; the default network, which is involved in self-related processing; and the salience network, which is involved in determining items for future processing.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In one study, Sacchet used network analysis to study the control network in individuals with mood or anxiety disorders. During the experiment, participants were studied in both a resting state and while completing a cognitive control task. They found that individuals without these disorders showed modulation in this control network depending on the context they were in, but “individuals with depression did not exhibit this flexibility,” Sacchet said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Judson Brewer, director of research and innovation at the Mindfulness Center, said he invited Sacchet to speak at the University because he is a “methodologic giant. He’s learned all of these different techniques and has started to apply those to look at clinical conditions.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Referencing the University’s creation and expansion of the Mindfulness Center, Brewer added that he hoped Sacchet could get people “excited about the future of neuroscience and how it applies to personalized medicine (as well as) meditation and mindfulness.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dante Flores-Demarchi ’21 said he attended the lecture out of a personal interest in meditation, and was not aware of the ongoing research into mindfulness. “I found that (work) really inspiring,” he added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><b>U. professor elected to board of American Physical Society</b></p>
<p class="p2">The American Physical Society has elected Professor of Physics S. James Gates to its presidential line, according to a University press release. The APS — a nonprofit organization representing over 55,000 physicists around the world — aims to use research and outreach to “advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics,” according to the release.</p>
<p class="p2">By joining the presidential line, Gates will start his role as vice president Jan. 1, 2019 before becoming president-elect in 2020 and president in 2021.</p>
<p class="p2">Gates is “known for pioneering work in theoretical physics, including the areas of supersymmetry and supergravity,” according to the press release. He has won numerous awards for his work, including the National Medal of Science, an honor given by the President of the United States to scientists and engineers.</p>
<p class="p2">Throughout his career, Gates has also made a name for himself as a science communicator, appearing regularly as an expert on science series and news broadcasts, according to the press release. He believes the APS should also play a role in communicating science to the public.</p>
<p class="p4"><b>U. to sponsor celebration of science at WaterFire</b></p>
<p class="p2">The University will co-host a science-focused event at WaterFire this Saturday. The Big Bang Science Fair will use activities, talks, exhibits and performances to “share the wonder of science” and explore the intersection of science and art, according to a University press release.</p>
<p class="p2">The family-friendly fair hopes to engage both scientists and non-scientists of all ages. Through the event, Professor of Physics Meenakshi Narain, a co-organizer, hopes to broaden the public’s perspective of science and convey the importance of science in people’s everyday lives, according to the release.</p>
<p class="p2">The fair will feature activities such as programming a robot and a video game design workshop. Speakers include Professor of Physics S. James Gates and Micky Dolenz, who is a “science enthusiast and member of the band The Monkees,” according to the press release.</p>
<p class="p2">The event begins at 3 p.m. in Providence’s Market Square and 7 Canal Walk.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Students spend summer developing introductory robotics course</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Four undergraduate students spent this past summer helping to create a robotics class, CSCI 1951-R: “Introduction to Robotics.” The course, taught by Professor of Computer Science Stefanie Tellex, teaches students how to assemble and eventually fly their own quadcopter drones, according to a press release from the computer science department.</p>
<p class="p2">Using funding from an Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award, Luke Eller ’21, Theo Guerin ’21, Garrett Warren ’21 and Sophie Yang ’21 worked to improve and refine the algorithms behind the drones and update the course based on last year’s student feedback, according to the press release. One algorithm they refined even allows the drones to fly autonomously.</p>
<p class="p2">The course itself uses inexpensive and rudimentary drones to teach students the basic concepts behind robotics, like how to integrate hardware and software. Eller, Guerin, Warren and Yang all agreed that their summer work helped them learn more about advanced robotics, according to the press release. All four students will serve as the course’s teaching assistants this fall.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Laboratory strives to develop vaccine against malaria</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Jonathan Kurtis ’89 PhD’95 MD’96, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine, did not first develop an interest in malaria behind a lab bench or as a training physician in a clinical setting. Instead, Kurtis’ bout with the disease during his junior year abroad in Kenya gave him a first-hand look at one of the world’s deadliest diseases and began his research aspirations to prevent it.</p>
<p class="p1">His story began on a night train from Nairobi to Mombasa, where his project on coral reef ecology was set to begin. Far from home and with no way to contact his family, he met Americans in the dining car and stayed up all night talking and drinking with them, bonding over their shared nationality. After waking up sick in the morning, Kurtis arrived in Mombasa. “I actually paid a guy to carry my rucksack, which was insane because I was broke,” he recalled. Finally, he reached the mud hut that he had rented for the project, took the malaria pills he had brought with him and passed out. Three days later, he awoke with no recollection of what had happened since his arrival. He didn’t even remember taking the pills, but fortunately, he had — he later found out that they saved his life. It was clear that what he had contracted was cerebral malaria.</p>
<p class="p1">After recovering from the harsh disease, Kurtis was able to carry on his coral reef project and thoroughly enjoyed it. At the same time, however, he grew witness and subject to the reality of what “an important thumb malaria is pressing down on the world’s populations.”</p>
<p class="p1">Upon graduating with a bachelor’s degrees in Geology and Biology from the University, Kurtis entered Alpert Medical School. He often met with the travel physician who had prescribed the medication that he took abroad, G. Richard Olds, who served as professor of medicine, pediatrics, molecular, cell and development biology at the time. Olds had become a mentor to Kurtis in the time since he had returned from Kenya. At one point during his tenure as a medical student, Kurtis considered dropping out of medical school. As Kurtis remembers, Olds inspired him to instead pursue research in conjunction with medicine, pushing him toward a doctoral program in his laboratory. Under Olds’s direction, Kurtis completed his PhD on schistosomiasis, a tropical disease caused by parasitic worms.</p>
<p class="p1">Jennifer Friedman ’92 MD’96, director of clinical studies for Lifespan’s Center for International Health Research and a professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at the Med School, similarly developed an interest in the disease upon working in Kenya. She was a Fulbright scholar there in between completing medical school and starting residency. “I was inspired by the enormous burden of disease despite good drugs and, as later identified as part of work I was involved that year with CDC, insecticide-treated bed nets,” she wrote in an email to The Herald. Alongside Kurtis, she has researched malaria and other parasitic diseases for years, pulling upon her expertise in pediatrics to advance their work.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, Kurtis serves as the director of Lifespan’s Center for International Health Research, which has a team of twenty investigators studying not only malaria, but other diseases including helminth infections, a soil-transmitted infection and Friedman’s current research focus. Many of the current investigators started as graduate students or postdoctoral researchers at the center before rising through the ranks to their current positions.</p>
<p class="p1">In concept, a malaria vaccine has existed in a lab setting for nearly five decades. “No mouse need live in fear; we can protect rodents without any challenge at all. The problem is (the vaccination method) hasn’t generalized into humans,” Kurtis said. Mice are often used in scientific research as an earlier step before moving into more advanced models or human trials. But “in malaria, mice lie,” Kurtis said — the form of malaria the mice develop does not simulate the human form well.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result, Kurtis’ team has taken a different approach. They spend time in Kenya and Tanzania, and study malaria resistance in children there. In the lab, the group tries to identify antibodies that occur naturally in people who are malaria-resistant. The team aims to detect the target of these antibodies and then, through a vaccine, expose children to this target so they make the antibodies against it.</p>
<p class="p1">Currently, their vaccine work is being tested on monkeys since the animals can actually contract the same type of malaria as humans do. “Before we (begin trials on) children, we’ve got to make sure (the vaccine) is safe and effective, and the only way to do that at the moment is in non-human primates,” Kurtis said, highlighting the current necessity of research on animals in the field. With additional studies and sufficient funding, their hope is to start a phase one clinical trial in humans within two to three years.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other researchers at the University are enthralled in understanding and potentially vaccinating against malaria as well. Dipak Raj, assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the Med School, has worked with Kurtis in the past to develop a malaria vaccine candidate. He started looking at possible vaccine mechanisms for malaria during his doctoral program in India, he said, before leaving for the United States and working at the National Institutes of Health before moving to the University. At the NIH, he helped identify a drug, Ketotifen, that has possible applications for malaria treatment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In tandem with his research, Kurtis has worked directly with malaria patients. Currently, he is involved in a study of children living in Kisumu, a city near Lake Victoria in Western Kenya. The region is plagued with malaria and has one of the highest rates of transmission of the disease in the world, said Kurtis. He added that in Kisumu every child, every day, gets an infected mosquito bite; one out of four children don’t make it to their fifth birthday. Kids between the ages of two and seven were enrolled in the study, and within a month, half had developed clinical episodes of malaria. The team has done extensive follow-ups on these kids, and six months into the study, zero fatalities have occurred, Kurtis said. He added that despite medical care and this intense follow-up, the heart-wrenching truth is that they expect five percent of the children to die within the four years of the study. “How does </span>it feel? It sucks. It absolutely sucks,” Kurtis reflected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>U. Professors find link between age, multiple births</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A new study by University professors shows older women are more likely to give birth to more than one baby at a time due to the aging reproductive system.</p>
<p class="p2">The researchers compared reproductively active white and black women ages 15 to 19 and reproductively active white and black women ages 35 to 39 and found that the older population experienced an increase of multiple births — having twins, triplets and so on, according to the study. While ten out of 1,000 women in the younger population had multiple births, 30 out of 1,000 women in the older population had multiple births, said Roee Gutman, associate professor of biostatistics.</p>
<p class="p2">“As women approach their mid-thirties and beyond, the incidence of (multiple births) increases threefold in the context of Caucasian women and fourfold in the context of African-American women,” said Eli Adashi, professor of medical science. “We know that in some communities in Africa that have been studied there seems to be a higher incidence of multiples which may well be genetically determined but has not been fully elucidated.”</p>
<p class="p2">Thirty-five to 39 years old “is about the time when the reproductive system in women is getting closer to the point where reproduction is no longer operational,” Adashi said. “There are probably subtle imperfections in the way that ovulation is controlled, so instead of ovulating a single egg, women in these age groups are increasingly ovulating more eggs,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">“Since women’s fertility declines starting at a surprisingly early age, around 30, the shift towards delaying childbearing results in more challenges in conceiving, more use of assisted reproductive technologies and more multiple births,” wrote David Savitz, associate dean for research, professor of obstetrics and gynecology, professor of pediatrics and professor of epidemiology, in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p2">“Today women, for good reasons, delay starting a family, and this phenomenon is bound to increase,” Adashi said. “The biggest problem with multiple pregnancy is premature labor. When you get to twins and triplets and beyond, the capacity to accommodate them throughout gestation is increasingly compromised. The babies rarely reach term simply because humans were not designed to carry multiples,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">“Ninety-eight to 99 percent of all births in the United States are singletons,” Adashi said.</p>
<p class="p2">“I think we need to focus on reducing this possibility (of multiple births). This is a very unhealthy state for the fetus and pregnant women,” said Sangshin Park, assistant professor of pediatrics.</p>
<p class="p2">Prior to the study, medical researchers already knew that childbearing at later ages was linked to multiple births, but it was not recognized as a main factor, Adashi said.</p>
<p class="p2">In the past, the occurrence of multiple births was attributed to drugs that increase ovulation, Gutman said. Before ovulation-inducing drugs were approved, there was a parabolic relationship between age and producing twins. This shows that age has been a factor even without the in-vitro fertilization practices currently, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">“Our study shows these fertility-promoting therapies should not be the only one to shoulder the blame,” Adashi said.</p>
<p class="p2">There are other factors related to age that could cause multiple births to occur, including previous pregnancies and obesity, but these need further research, Gutman said.</p>
<p class="p2">“Many couples want to round out the family, having another girl or another boy,” Adashi said. “That decision could lead to much more than one bargained for.”</p>
<p class="p2">“Because the reasons for delaying childbearing are personal and take many factors into consideration, I don’t think this suggests women be discouraged about the consequences of delay but rather be informed to make the best judgment for themselves,” Savitz wrote.</p>
<p class="p2">“This is an interesting, unusual perspective on an unintended consequence of delayed childbearing,” Savitz added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“On a national level, this has implications for reproductive health services to meet the needs of older mothers and more multiple births.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Three weeks ago, Dima Amso, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences and principle investigator in the Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Lab took her second trip to Jordan to discuss the data her lab analyzed from the nonprofit organization We Love Reading. Her work focused on analyzing the effect of reading on the mental health of Jordanian children. Amso’s goal was to use the data to test the impact of this program on the cognitive development of children living in the country.</p>
<p class="p4">“We Love Reading is an intervention for children in (middle- and low-income) countries,” Amso said. Children in these regions tend to be exposed to reading for educational or religious purposes, according to the WLR website. But WLR provides “an opportunity to bring to kids the joy of reading for pleasure,” Amso said.</p>
<p class="p4">The relationship between Amso’s lab and WLR began about a year and a half ago after Amso took a trip to Jordan with other University faculty members to see how she could help those affected by the Syrian civil war. On her trip, Amso met Rana Dajani, director and founder of the non-profit. After the trip, the two stayed in contact and developed Amso’s research proposal.</p>
<p class="p4">While WLR is based on human-centered design, it supports its mission with rigorous research, an aim it hoped to expand by partnering with Amso, Dajani said.</p>
<p class="p4">Preliminary data for Amso’s work was collected in Jordan, both before and three months after children went through the WLR program. Amso’s lab analyzed the data and found that WLR seemed to be improving the mental health of Jordanian children, which the team found encouraging, Amso said. The data suggested that activities like reading for pleasure, hearing stories read aloud and taking books home to read with parents are having a positive impact on kids, she added.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the nonprofit was created to have an impact on children of all communities and not only refugees, Amso said that future projects with WLR will involve assessing the efficacy of reading for pleasure as a resilience factor for children who are exposed to stressors very early in life, a common experience for children who are refugees.</span></p>
<p class="p4">“You have a group of children who are a unique population in that they are experiencing early life adversity in the form of chronic toxic stress,” said Alya Al-Sagar, visiting research associate in Amso’s lab. Moving forward, the lab aims to discern “what can predispose resilience to these stressors,” she added. Community engagement, interaction with primary caregivers and reading are factors that can work together to create resilience in refugee kids, she continued.</p>
<p class="p4">To achieve these aims, researchers hope to collect data on children’s daily experiences, measuring stressors, risk factors for stress and positive resilience factors, Amso said. The group aims to understand how those experiences interact to either mitigate or exacerbate the effects of the stressors on the children.</p>
<p class="p4">The data on these experiences can he<span class="s4">lp Amso’s lab understand which variables help the children benefit from an intervention like those conducted by WLR. “We can’t change (the children’s) political climate but what we can do is say, ‘here are the resilience and risk factors that are going to make them most likely to benefit,’” Amso said. </span></p>
<p class="p4">Amso stressed that her work with WLR is not so much for the sake of research but rather for assessing the usefulness of the program as an intervention and considering ways to improve the intervention’s efficacy.</p>
<p class="p4">Amso hopes to expand her work with the organization and is in the process of writing a grant for a project that would assess WLR’s impact on resilience in children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UTRA program to cover research costs</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/24/utra-program-cover-research-costs/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">At the annual Summer Research Symposium in August, hundreds of students presented their work on topics from archeology to biomedical engineering, and roughly 85 percent of the presenters received Undergraduate Teaching and Research Awards grants for their work. This year, the University introduced the Supplementary UTRA program to support student research projects, allowing faculty sponsors to buy equipment, send students to conferences and meet other needs that are outside of the traditional grant.</p>
<p class="p2">UTRAs are typically awarded to students working closely with faculty members on research projects or teaching collaborations. The Undergraduate Teaching and Research Awards have existed for more than 30 years, but the program has continued to evolve as funding has expanded and projects have diversified.</p>
<p class="p2">The program has grown tenfold since its inception, said Oludurotimi Adetunji, associate dean of the college for undergraduate research and inclusive science. The award acts as a stipend for the student conducting the work, but funds for project-related expenses have historically been provided from alternative sources, Adetunji added.</p>
<p class="p2">The new S-UTRA aims to alleviate the financial pressure faced by faculty members who support undergraduate student work by providing $500 to fund costs associated with the student project. The grant was initiated in response to faculty feedback on the UTRA program, as many faculty members thought the money would lessen financial pressure from their work, Adetunji said. The supplementary grant was left open-ended so the money could be used toward a variety of purposes, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">The new program differs slightly from the larger, general UTRA grant in that faculty members rather than students apply for the S-UTRA. Student sponsors submitted budget requests attached to the project and were granted funds accordingly.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The S-UTRA was granted across several disciplines in its inaugural year, including history and chemistry. One of the first recipients of the award was Kareen Coulombe, assistant professor of engineering, molecular pharmacology, physiology and biotechnology. Coulombe worked with Jasmine Gabor ’21, who spent the summer investigating the effects of BPA, an environmental toxicant, on female heart cells, Coulombe said. The chemical mimics estrogen and thus provided a unique insight into women’s heart health. Gabor compared both male and female cells, using the male heart cells as controls because they do not have as many estrogen receptors, Gabor said. The S-UTRA allowed the group to purchase an important antibody for their work without placing additional financial pressure on Coulombe. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Gabor’s work benefitted from the additional grant, she wasn’t aware that her project had received the money until mid-summer, she said. Ultimately, Coulombe was the main beneficiary as she no longer had to rely on outside funding, Gabor said. But $500 does not cover the entirety of the costs associated with supporting an undergraduate researc</span>her, Coulombe said. She typically uses funds from within the department that can be used to cover extraneous costs to fund projects outside the realm of her grants, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">So far, Adetunji has heard “stellar” feedback from faculty members who received the supplementary award. He said that the S-UTRA is a “program that everyone is proud of” and allows students to take their research further.</p>
<p class="p2">The S-UTRA is only the latest example of how the UTRA program has adapted to meet research demand from undergraduates and faculty. In the 2014-15 academic year, the University introduced the Interdisciplinary Team UTRA, which brings together groups of faculty members and students from different areas for a research project. This grant has flourished and was also motivated by faculty demand, Adetunji said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>U. awarded grant to help expedite atom-level simulations</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Since atomic-level simulations are becoming more accurate and growing more complex, it takes more time for them to run their courses. Machine learning may be the key to speeding up these simulations by “magnitudes,” said Andrew Peterson, an associate professor in Brown’s School of Engineering, in a University news release.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Research spearheaded by University scientists is funded by a $3.5 million grant from the United States Department of Energy and will take place over the course of four years. The research will initially involve electrochemical reactions and utilize a software called the Atomistic Machine-learning Package, which was developed by Peterson’s research group.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">All of these different simulations, including ones that analyze chemical reactions and material properties, run on similar calculations, so machine learning may be able to identify these underlying calculations and figure out how to speed them up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Researchers examine brain perceptions of optical illusions</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">University computer experts conducted research to understand the neural operations that go into comprehending a certain type of optical illusion. The team used a computational model, which was subject to the bounds of different parts of the visual cortex, to see how neurons interacted with one another when viewing the illusion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The study focused on contextual phenomena, a type of optical illusion in which context influences the perception of an image. One example of this illusion is color differentiation, in which one color is contrasted with differently hued backgrounds, which results in differences in color detection. The team created a model of hypothesized feedback connections of neurons, which respond differently depending on the context. The team found that their model’s reaction to the optical illusions mirrored that of humans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Mothers’ marijuana use tied to children’s earlier use</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">New research found that the children of mothers that use marijuana between their child’s birth and 12th birthday start using the drug two years earlier than their peers. The study was co-conducted by Natasha Sokol, a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, and was based off of longitudinal surveys from across the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Sokol conducted the research as a graduate student, and the study was published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine Sept. 24. Cassandra Okechukwu, a researcher at Harvard, worked with Sokol on the study.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In the year since Professor of Mathematics Jill Pipher was named vice president for research, her office has undergone a series of developments including the creation of the Office for Industry Engagement and Commercial Venturing, headed by Executive Director Daniel Behr. Pipher has also participated in research advocacy efforts in Washington and worked to give faculty members the resources necessary to realize their investigative aspirations.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Within the many departments in the Office of the Vice President for Research, the University has focused on developing the Office for Industry Engagement and Commercial Venturing. “The launch of this office is part of Brown’s expanded commitment to translational research,” Pipher said. Behr and Pipher assumed their posts around the same time last year.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the 14 months since Behr came to the University, his office has worked to “help accelerate the flow of innovation from lab to market,” Behr said, adding that they essentially bridge the gap between Brown’s research community and companies that may be interested in further developing scholars’ work from an entrepreneurial perspective. The office works closely with the Jonathan M. Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship, but it specifically focuses on helping faculty pursue potential commercialization when the University has ownership over the intellectual property from their research, Behr explained.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When working to form partnerships with companies and funding sources for these commercial pursuits, Behr said his colleagues often hear from industry representatives that they like working with University-affiliated projects for two reasons: The academic atmosphere offers an “ingrained culture of convergence of disciplines” and emphasizes undergraduate research on campus. Students can get further involved in the sort of commercial partnerships Behr advances through programs like the Hyundai Visionary Challenge, as The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/13/hyundai-university-tackle-research-challenge/">previously reported</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“There are faculty whose research, with a little extra help, could produce new technology and products that would be profoundly important to society, and we want to help them make that leap,” Pipher said. The University can help researchers get a patent, form a startup company or establish a corporate-sponsored research agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beyond aiding faculty and student researchers as they interact with the corporate world, Pipher’s first year in office has also been characterized by an emphasis on “communication and advocacy about research,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pipher travels to Washington frequently — roughly once a month. There, she meets with federal agency program officers and interacts with congressional delegations and policy committees. “It’s an important part of my job to advocate for research in general,” Pipher said, adding that federal program officers have visited Brown’s research facilities and met with faculty for the same purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Her work to further promote communication about research on campus includes a new annual research magazine, “Impact.” The office also shares research efforts on its Twitter account.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To physically centralize collaboration between the various offices Pipher oversees, the Office of Vice President for Research and its affiliates relocated to the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/30/administrative-offices-begin-moving-south-street-landing/">South Street Landing</a> buildings in the Jewelry District of downtown Providence, which welcomed staff starting in October last year. Though Pipher splits her time between that location and University Hall, she said the move has been good for the office, which previously saw different teams working from multiple locations on campus. “It’s a wonderful working environment,” she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These teams have also seen some growth in numbers during Pipher’s time in office. Through her efforts to achieve “operational excellence,” new staff have been hired to help with grant administration and research management support, on top of adding a few members to Behr’s team, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Next week, Pipher will give a presentation at the Transforming Research conference hosted in part by Associate Director of the Carney Institute for Brain Science Christopher Moore. The conference, held last year at Johns Hopkins University, comes to the University this year to grapple with the “science of science” by discussing the criteria through which research is evaluated and how scientific success can best be achieved, among other topics, Moore said. Transforming Research will bring together professionals from various disciplines including publishing and library science for lectures and breakout discussions over two days. Pipher hopes the University can promote “a research environment that’s really driven by our best shared values, societal benefit of research, ethical conduct, generosity and inclusion.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“My goal is to make sure that Brown has all the infrastructure necessary to do the cutting edge research that it is doing and can do more of,” Pipher said, who serves as vice president for research until 2020.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ethan Fecht ’20 and Jack Nassetta, a junior at the George Washington University, spent the summer analyzing over 850,000 tweets from Russia attempting to spread disinformation about Syria in the United States. This Russian strategy was launched through a number of fake Twitter accounts in an effort to fracture U.S. political groups, distort facts surrounding current events and create national discord, Fecht said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The fake accounts’ main objectives are to stop international intervention and, more specifically, to criticize the United States for attacking Syria following the use of chemical weapons in Douma, Syria in April 2018, Fecht said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Working at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, Fecht and Nassetta combed through Twitter tweets and to discern fake accounts, typically referred to as “bots” or “trolls.” They also worked to formulate a list of red flags that denote, to a degree of certainty, the validity of the accounts. “It’s subjective in some sense, so you have to come up with fairly objective criteria to have a strong methodology,” Fecht said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most of these accounts present themselves as followers of U.S. conservative viewpoints yet criticize President Donald Trump and spread false information to lessen support for the President. “(These accounts) introduce these narratives into alt-right conversations,” Nassetta said. “It creates a growing fracture among this narrative.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The accounts also spread rumors and attempt to shift blame for the attacks. For example, the accounts claim that the White Helmets, a Syrian volunteer organization, is affiliated with Al-Qaeda. Additionally, several accounts claim that the chemical attack in Douma did not happen at all, Fecht said. “I do think it’s effective. I don’t know how effective,” Fecht said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It’s so cheap, and they definitely create some kind of division. It’s a success, and they’re going to keep doing it,” Nassetta added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Fecht described the process as both “quantitative and qualitative.” The team used software such as Excel to analyze data but also looked at individual users to identify fake accounts. Characteristics including the date of the account’s creation, discussion of Russian politics from someone claiming to be American and a preoccupation with conspiratorial themes were considered to be indicative of fake accounts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The project began when both Nassetta and Fecht were fellows at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, California. Fecht has a military background with skills in data analysis and spent several years working for the National Security Agency and the Navy before coming to Brown as a Resumed Undergraduate Education student. Nassetta has a background in political communication with a focus on disinformation. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After analyzing tweets to identify common themes among these fake accounts, they produced a 50-page report on their research, Nassetta said. “You’re just looking at this (account) and (thinking), ‘I can’t tell if you’re crazy, if you’re super ideologically committed to this conspiratorial stuff or if you’re a Russian troll.’ There’s a ton of uncertainty,” Fecht said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to the 50-page report, Fecht and Nassetta published a companion <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/09/17/russia-is-gearing-up-to-misinform-the-u-s-public-about-syria-heres-our-cheat-sheet-to-identify-twitter-trolls/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c0f8ed06891a">piece</a> meant for a popular audience in The Washington Post, and the team has since garnered wide-ranging praise for the work. They have even received an offer from the State Department to further discuss their findings, Nassetta said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the future, Nassetta and Fecht aim to delve deeper into the tweets being sent by these fake accounts and analyze which ones received engagement by looking at favorites and retweets, Fecht said. The fake accounts are “casting a wide net, but they know that one in every 20 (tweets) is going to be a hit and is going to change minds,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Russia is not the only country in which disinformation tactics are being employed, Fecht said. Saudi Arabia saw a spike in fake accounts spreading disinformation and condemnation of the arrest of a number of the country’s activists and the nation’s scandal with Canada, Nassetta said. Additionally, a rise of disinformation has been seen within Iran, which has attempted to influence the American political scene and prevent American intervention, Fecht added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While there is still little evidence of disinformation tactics used in the United States, we may soon see a rise in this type of propaganda, particularly<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in the 2020 presidential election, Fecht said. There was a suspected rise in fake accounts connected to the ongoing Senate campaign in Texas, as a number of Twitter accounts tweeted the same message supporting Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), he added. Since it is not currently possible to determine which accounts are fake with complete certainty, there is no concrete way to combat this disinformation, Nassetta said. “You can only build up resistance yourself,” he added. “You want to be attuned to the sources of information.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">William Potter, director of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said their research “contributed significantly to our understanding of how these (social media) tools could be misused.” It is “unusual to have undergraduates who are relatively new to the subject gain that kind of international attention,” he added. “I was exceptionally proud of the two of them for the quality of the research, the manner in which they presented it and the attention it generated.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The fields of neuroscience and neurotechnology have been growing in recent years as researchers hope to understand the inner workings of the human species’ most puzzling organ: the brain. In particular, the motor cortex and its crucial role in coordinating movement has garnered attention from top scientists in the field. Assistant Professor of Neuroscience Carlos Vargas-Irwin ’02<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>recently received a $1.5 million, five-year New Innovator Award from the National Institutes of Health to fund his research that analyzes the motor cortex and potential clinical applications related to it.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The award will strongly benefit BrainGate, a joint research program between Brown, Stanford University and Case Western University that aims to help those with motor control issues and paralysis. “BrainGate is a whole endeavor to try to help paralyzed people move again,” said John Donoghue, professor of neuroscience and a principal investigator of the program.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Patient volunteers agree to become part of BrainGate research to help further the team’s understanding of the brain’s mechanisms. These volunteers are studied in controlled scenarios and receive a sensory implant in their motor cortex that collects data, Vargas-Irwin said. “They join the trial with the understanding that their experience will not necessarily help them now, … but (it will) help us develop better models for future clinical work.” Vargas-Irwin has devoted countless hours to BrainGate and has collaborated with a number of University faculty including Donoghue and Professor of Engineering Leigh Hochberg, another prinicipal investigator of the endeavor. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Carlos is a wonderfully thoughtful and insightful neuroscientist. I’m thrilled that he’s received this new grant and honor from NIH,” Hochberg said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The BrainGate team has used this technology to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/04/university-study-improves-interfaces-brain-computers/">control artificial limbs</a>. The team connects the sensory implant to technology that stimulates certain muscles in the limbs to facilitate movement, Donoghue described. By using these functional electrical stimulation systems, the team created a “physical nervous system” that allowed patients to regain movement, he added. Current technology, however, does not allow for fluid, fast or reliable movement. “The main challenge is closing that gap,” Vargas-Irwin said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The more we know about how the brain controls movement, the more we can make it just as natural as you or me,” Donoghue said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Using the recently acquired grant, Vargas-Irwin and his team are implementing cameras to capture external sensory input during movement. By combining this data with information from the sensory implant, the team hopes to create a cohesive model of sensory feedback to facilitate fluid transmission and movement of the patient, Vargas-Irwin said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Currently, Vargas-Irwin and other researchers are working toward improving the decoding of information from the motor cortex and the engineering of the technology being used, Vargas-Irwin said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The technology in use currently necessitates a connection to a computer to allow for movement, but the team hopes to work toward placing all of the necessary technology inside of the body, Donoghue added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"> “The idea would be you’re in class with somebody someday and they’d be taking notes on their laptop, and they would say: ‘A few years ago I had a spinal cord injury, but I’ve got BrainGate and now you can’t tell,’” Donoghue said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Neurotechnology in general is gaining more and more interest. … It’s a very exciting field to be working in, and I really look forward to taking this technology and making a positive effect in the lives of many people across the world,” Vargas-Irwin said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New CS professor Pavlick seeks to unite tech, language</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A simple conversation between two friends can be understood by a toddler, but even the most sophisticated computer models struggle to grasp linguistic nuance. Assistant Professor of Computer Science Ellie Pavlick, who joined the department this July, hopes to change this. Pavlick launched the Language Understanding and Representation Lab, which focuses on improving computational models of natural language. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Her research specifically studies how two statements differ in terms of their connotations and implicit meanings. If someone says “‘I’m going to Michigan’ versus ‘I’m going home,’ … there are stylistic differences that communicate a lot more” than is said in just words, Pavlick said. She hopes to make this type of conversational language more comprehensible to computers. Pavlick explained that her work is important because understanding language requires “a good model of how humans work.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though she is still in the midst of starting a new research group at the University, Pavlick has said her work so far is “really exciting.” Her lab is distinctive because it already has so many students working together only a few weeks into the school year, a trend that is not common among new labs, she said. Despite the number of students, the team has “clicked with each other and became a unit.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chris Callison-Burch, Pavlick’s doctoral advisor and associate professor of computer and information science at Penn, said that the unusual number of students in her lab this early on is a “testament to her creativity and her energy and all the cool ideas she has with her research in (language) processing.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Before joining the University, Pavlick spent a year at Google Research in New York. Working in an academic setting primarily differs from working in the corporate environment at Google in the time horizon for her projects, she said. “Ambitious research at Google is a three-year plan,” whereas academic research just has to be completed “before I die,” Pavlick said, adding that she benefits from the freedom that an academic setting provides. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a graduate student, Pavlick worked closely with Callison-Burch, who oversaw Pavlick’s work that “helped to build the paraphrase database (that) contains 100 million English phrases paired with meaning equivalent expressions.” He also collaborated with Pavlick to build a gun violence database that tracks reported shootings from online local newspapers and television to predict trends from these sources, he said. They hoped that the database would use newspaper articles to monitor gun violence in the United States, but their project was cut short. Callison-Burch added that “(Pavlick) was the best PhD student (he has) ever worked with,” saying that she will be a “very popular professor to work with” at the University. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While she focused on teaching computers to understand paraphrasing during her time as a doctoral student at Penn, Pavlick came to the University to explore other avenues within natural language processing. She said that the University has a culture that is “very unique and supportive” and that she enjoys the encouragement of risk-taking. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This semester, she is teaching CSCI 2952D: “Computational Semantics,” a graduate seminar focused on NLP. Though it is her first year teaching, Pavlick said that “the students are all very smart and ask great questions,” adding that they are “very involved and engaged.” She will also be teaching CSCI 1951A: “Data Science” in the spring, a larger undergraduate lecture course. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Pavlick recently joined the department, but she has already begun reaching out to others in the field at the University, including Assistant Professor Stefanie Tellex, Professor Eugene Charniak, Professor Michael Littman and Assistant Professor George Konidaris. She hopes to work with them to explore the process of building data sets and how language fits in with robotics, among other topics, Pavlick explained. She also hopes to take advantage of Brown’s<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>interdisciplinary nature and collaborate with people in cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences, economics and political science departments because their work aligns closely with hers. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Aaron Traylor GS, Albert Webson GS and Roma Patel GS, all members of Pavlick’s lab, described her as an extremely positive person to work with, citing her research and determination as especially admirable. Webson highlighted the support she offers to her students, while Traylor emphasized her dissatisfaction with simple answers. “She thinks big,” Traylor said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Transforming Research conference discusses ‘science of science’</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/04/transforming-research-conference-discusses-science-science/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Wednesday morning, the Transforming Research Conference welcomed a unique group of professionals to South Street Landing for a series of lectures and discussions. The gathering brings together not only researchers but also research funders, metrics experts, librarians, publishers and other stakeholders in the research community. The conference gives them a space to learn and discuss what Professor of Neuroscience Christopher Moore calls the “science of science.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moore is interested in the potential for research processes to be evaluated in a more scientific way. The “macro-level understanding of the (research) enterprise is amazingly non-scientific,” Moore said, and suggested that the best way to measure success in research has yet to be determined. “If we could understand what success was, then maybe we could figure out which environments were best to create it,” he said. “Maybe we could create those environments at Brown.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, research is evaluated in a number of ways — how many times a certain paper is cited, how many shares on social media it gets or the number of patents that come out of it, said Mike Taylor, an organizer of the conference and head of metrics development at technology research investment company Digital Science. Developing metrics for scientific discovery allows the scientific community to standardize all of these different forms of data so that they can be compared.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Applying metrics to discovery attempts to “measure the immeasurable,” Moore said. While no ideal evaluation system exists, the conference aims to get the community closer to an answer, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Transforming Research held its inaugural meeting last year at Johns Hopkins University. Moore got excited about the conference when his colleague John Armstrong, the CEO of DiscoveryEngine, attended the event last year. Moore’s enthusiasm helped bring the conference to the University this year, Taylor said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Although data and evidence are becoming increasingly important, we don’t often have conversations about what all of these numbers mean,” Taylor said. As a result, Transforming Research aimed to create a space for those conversations to occur. He elaborated that, based on last year’s meeting, the most important component of the conference was the generous amount of time left between scheduled lectures that gives attendees and speakers the chance to talk to each other and interact with those outside of their subfield.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University offers an environment conducive to the themes of the conference, Moore said. “It’s a wonderful campus full of lots of different kinds of scholars,” Moore said, and added that the University has many proponents of “fairness and openness in academia.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Cornelia Dean, visiting professor of the practice of science, technology and society and former science editor at the New York Times, spoke at the event on Wednesday morning. Her talk centered on the public’s understanding of science, and the various barriers that can prevent the complete comprehension of research for those who aren’t involved in it. She has written two books — her first, “Am I Making Myself Clear?,” focuses on how researchers can present their work to a common audience, while her second title, “Making Sense of Science,” acts a guide for the public to understand scientific research. Before she spoke at the event, Dean said her remarks would highlight the notion that “the research community needs to engage more frequently, and better, with the public.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Increasing public interaction with science is crucial in a world that more frequently faces controversial breakthroughs, Dean said, and drew on examples such as CRISPR genetic modification, artificial intelligence on the battlefield and geoengineering. Decisions on these issues cannot be made without “ordinary citizens who are able to carry on conversations … in a way that’s based on fact and not on manipulation,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Transforming Research continues today with a program that features a talk by Neil Sarkar, the director of the Brown Center for Biomedical Informatics, a session on research policy and strategy led by Taylor and Armstrong and presentations on citizen science, metrics and other topics.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Laser scan reveals massive ancient Mayan civilization in Guatemala</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">At first glance, it could be easy to dismiss a patch in the Guatemalan jungle as just trees and plants. But after extensive analysis of a region spanning more than 2,100 square kilometers, a team of researchers has discovered an expansive ancient Mayan civilization overrun by the surrounding flora. Professor of Social Science Stephen Houston was part of the team that made the discovery, using lasers to survey the area. Beginning in 2016, the team flew over the area, shooting beams at the ground from as many as six different angles to get a detailed map of the land below. By “stripping” the land of surrounding plants and trees, the technology allowed researchers to see exactly where old buildings and ruins laid.</p>
<p class="p2">The findings “quite literally took my breath away,” Houston said in a University press release. As a result of the work, the team now estimates the population of the area to have been between seven and 11 million during the height of the Mayan civilization.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Software tool released to democratize brain scanning technology</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">The brain’s inner workings can be nearly impossible to measure, but Associate Professor of Neuroscience Stephanie Jones is working to change that. Jones recently released a user-friendly version of a software tool that describes the activity in the outer layer of the brain. By creating a tool that will assist doctors and clinicians with electroencephalography, Jones hopes that the assessment will become more common and properly diagnose a greater number of patients than is currently possible. Supported by a $1.6 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, Jones is working to democratize the technology and make it available to more people around the world.</p>

<p class="p2">Disaster can strike out of nowhere and wreak havoc on entire communities and neighborhoods. In an effort to study the response to these disasters, the Brown University International Advanced Research Institutes and Humanitarian Innovation Initiative have launched a fellowship to evaluate the best tactics and programs to address immediate and long-term needs of the relief efforts. For one week in late October, fellows in the Philippines and surrounding Southeast Asian countries will collaborate on potential paths forward, share their experiences and hear a number of lectures on innovative tactics being employed around the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">When one of her teammates on the women’s soccer team fractured her collarbone, Christine Etzel ’19 knew how to contextualize the injury. A former member of the University’s Sports Injury Lab, Etzel has studied the conditions that lead to upper extremity sports injuries. Aiming to hasten injured athletes’ return to sports, the lab has been involved in several recent publications about the mechanisms behind certain sports injuries, the risk factors and the implications these injuries have for the sport as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There are not many research groups in the area that study sports injuries, said Brett Owens, professor of orthopedics at Alpert Medical School and principal investigator of the research group. “The work we primarily do is epidemiology work, which is looking at the incidence and risk factors for injury.” The group hopes that their research will lead to innovative ideas to prevent injuries, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One recent publication from the lab focused on upper extremity injuries among high school and college soccer players. “Upper extremity injuries aren’t as common as lower extremity injuries in soccer players, but at the same time, they are a big deal when they happen,” Etzel said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The group used the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, a public access database that holds demographic and injury-related information on emergency room visits from about 100 hospitals across the country. They looked at high school and college emergency room patients who had soccer-related injuries from 1999 to 2016 and found that of those incidents, about 20 percent were in the upper extremities. Because of the seriousness of these injuries, which include fractures and dislocations, the study can be used by coaches and athletes to develop strategies and exercises to prevent them, Etzel added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Another study centered on upper extremity boxing injuries in the United States. The organization USA Boxing did not record injury rates before 2011, so the paper’s results were relatively novel, said Lauren Ready MD’21, a member of the lab. New rules for the sport were implemented in 2013 to try to make boxing safer, but there hadn’t been any reviews on injury rates after the changes, she noted. The group found that there was a decrease in injuries after the rule change, highlighting the correlation between the two, she added. While it’s hard to definitively prove causation, identifying this strong correlation has a tangible benefit, Ready said. This research “can help athletes and coaches anticipate and avoid injury because they know the common injuries and the most common age groups for those injuries,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To find the incidence of these injuries in boxers, the group also used the national injury database. “Since it covers enough of the nation, you can infer that (this data) reflects the national averages,” Ready said. The group searched for both men and women from 2012 to 2016, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“What’s great about the Sports Injury Lab is the diversity,” Ready said. “It really covers a breadth of sports and studies all (aspects) of injury.” She mentioned prevention, recovery improvement and patient experience enhancement as some facets of injury that the lab studies.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Until you can study the (injury) and understand who it’s happening to, it’s hard to intervene and try to prevent (them),” Owens said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Opportunity Insights helps craft policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is well known that a person’s environment impacts them in many ways, but researchers have recently found that upward mobility is influenced not only by the city or region where a person grew up, but the exact neighborhood they called home. A team led in part by Professor of Economics John Friedman, as well as researchers from Harvard and the U.S. Census Bureau, published the “Opportunity Atlas” last Monday, and with it launched “Opportunity Insights,” a research and policy organization based at Harvard.</p>
<p class="p2">The “Opportunity Atlas” creates new, highly localized metrics for measuring neighborhood quality and has been in the works for roughly 18 months, Friedman said. The interactive infographic and accompanying research paper build on foundational research that “looked at intergenerational mobility and kid’s long-term outcomes” across certain cities and colleges. The Opportunity Atlas used similar methods to study variations in upward mobility between neighborhoods, with a particular focus on the economic prospects of low-income children.</p>
<p class="p2">This effort began as an “informal research consortium” called the Equality of Opportunity Project, said Shannon Felton Spence MPA ’17, communications director of Opportunity Insights. This consortium had privileged access to large administrative data sets gathered as part of the Census in 2000 and 2010 and federal income tax data gathered by the Internal Revenue Service. “There was always an appetite from local policymakers across the country to use that data in their own daily policy making,” Felton Spence said, adding that policymakers reached out to the economists in the consortium, such as Friedman, for guidance on how this data could be applied. This call for collaboration inspired the creation of Opportunity Insights, which aims to make data accessible for policymakers and public officials.</p>
<p class="p2">The Opportunity Atlas analyzed the data of 20 million Americans in their mid-thirties and mapped this data onto their hometowns in order to assess each neighborhood. The study estimates “children’s average earnings” within a neighborhood; these estimates vary depending on parental income, gender and race, according to the “Opportunity Atlas” executive summary.</p>
<p class="p2">“From a policymaking perspective, if we wanted to understand things that were happening across broad swaths of childhood — we really needed to get inside the city,” Friedman said. As a result, Freidman and his fellow researchers adopted a highly localized approach, focusing on specific neighborhoods rather than the cities as wholes. Given the degrees to which different areas within a large city vary, “thinking about it as a whole, especially for the outcomes of kids, just didn’t seem right,” Friedman added.</p>
<p class="p2">In order to take a more detailed look at districts in the United States, the group analyzed “census tracts,” which are subdivisions devised for census data collection. The study showed that the poverty level within each tract impacted outcomes for children who grew up there, Friedman said.</p>
<p class="p2">Researchers also examined whether or not adjacent tracts, or nearby neighborhoods, have an impact on outcomes. The study concluded that economic mobility outcomes “only correlate within your census tract … even blocks in your census tract that are further away than about half a mile don’t really correlate with your outcomes. It’s this incredibly localized impact of neighborhood that seems to matter the most,” Friedman said.</p>
<p class="p2">Another important facet of Friedman and his team’s work was its capacity to show how “neighborhoods may really matter in different ways for different groups. Even within an area, African American versus Hispanic individuals (for example) … seem to have different outcomes,” said Eric Chyn, assistant professor of economics at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p class="p2">Policy interventions will have to consider these nuances resulting from race and gender in order to be successful, according to the executive summary.</p>
<p class="p2">“Just how much variation there is within cities is super important and that’s something that this study is directly trying to shed light on,” Chyn said.</p>
<p class="p2">The “Opportunity Atlas” interactive tool, available online, allows users to input their census tract and engage with the data for their region against the backdrop of national trends in social mobility.</p>
<p class="p2">Researchers and the general public are increasingly interested in “trying to understand neighborhood quality,” Friedman said. Neighborhoods have traditionally been assessed using statistics like home values, incomes, percent of residents with high school and college diplomas and job availability, for example. But these metrics fail to directly measure how children from a neighborhood fare later in life, Friedman said, adding that there may or may not be a correlation with children’s long-term outcomes.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Some of the common metrics that cities may use to describe growth or development actually don’t directly impact the outcomes of children growing up there, Friedman said. He drew upon the example of Atlanta, Georgia, where job growth is occurring at a rapid rate without any major positive impact on local residents since jobs are being filled by people from outside the city. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Only about half of the discrepancies in neighborhood quality can be predicted by these common metrics; sometimes two neighborhoods may look statistically similar but still differ in terms of the outcomes of children growing up there, Friedman said. The new metrics developed by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Opportunity Atlas” aim to provide a more accurate picture, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Already, Opportunity Insights has influenced policy initiatives in various cities. “We are partnering with the Seattle Housing Authority and the King County Housing Authority in Washington to help families with housing vouchers understand what are neighborhoods that are higher opportunity and what are neighborhoods that are lower opportunity,” he said. “We are actively trying to help move kids to places that are better.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a practicing physician, Francois Luks, professor of surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology at the Alpert Medical School, regularly used drawings to illustrate complicated medical concepts to his patients. After noticing his talents, a medical student approached him and asked him to teach a course on the intersection of drawing and the medical practice. Today, Luks and his co-teacher Emily Slapin, a teacher with the Rhode Island School of Design Continuing Education Program, offer PLME 0400: “Introduction to Medical Illustration,” a course that teaches the history of drawing in the field and focuses on how to draw important medical concepts. The course is offered to medical students as well as undergraduates.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Previous seminars and workshops focused on the intersection of medicine and humanities, but none focused exclusively on medical illustration. The concept of a medical illustration course is a novel one to many;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>there are only four accredited medical illustration programs in the United States. When Luks presented the course concept to the Association of Medical Illustrators, an organization that brings together experts in the field, many audience members were inspired by his talk and sought to start their own courses. At the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, for example, medical illustrators had hoped to develop a similar course but hadn’t yet started. Following Luks’ presentation, they plan to initiate a related concept at their institution.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since its conception, the course has evolved to provide students with greater exposure to the field of medical illustration. Originally, the course was offered as a workshop but was eventually expanded into a preclinical elective for first- and second-year medical students. Hoping to expand the class even further, Luks contacted administrators at RISD and eventually partnered with Slapin, who focuses on the drawing aspects of the course. Together, the two have lengthened the course to a full semester and allowed PLME students and other undergraduates the chance to enroll starting last year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By offering the course to undergraduates, Luks and Slapin are trying to open up students’ minds to other careers. For medical students, the course is intended to develop their nonverbal communication and analytical skills as prospective physicians. “Big words often don’t work, and drawing helps a lot,” Luks said. Often there are barriers between a physician and a patient in terms of education level, language and other factors, and being able to draw can improve communication. Additionally, developing drawing skills pushes a person to pick out the most important concepts and analyze topics from different angles, Luks said. Luks dubs this way of thinking as the “Ikea model”: concise, simplistic drawings that can be understood by people regardless of background, similar to the way that Ikea instructions are easy to follow, he described. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While Luks and Slapin developed a passion for art early on, they emphasize that confidence in one’s drawing abilities is not important for enrollment. In fact, only approximately “half of students enrolled in the course have had any art education,” Luks said. The students are given individual feedback on their drawings and generally improve their drawing skills by the end of the course. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This fall, the course has had students spend half of class time at RISD studios with models, “so it was more hands-on, which I think rounds the course out a bit,” Slapin said. The hands-on experience helps students grasp the material better, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Students are thankful for the course and have responded to surveys positively. Sophia Sung ’19, who previously took the course, said that she decided to enroll “to learn more about the intersection of art and medicine while getting the opportunity to reconnect with art.” She now wants to continue delving into the field of medical illustration by applying concepts she learned to her future work. Juliana Kim ’20, also a previous student, said the course “made me realize that … my two interests (in art and science) did not necessarily conflict. It was an incredible experience, uniting my scientific and artistic side in such a physical way.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Panel talks importance of trans-centered research</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At an event hosted by the School of Public Health Wednesday night, Michelle Forcier, professor of pediatrics and associate dean of medicine at the Alpert Medical School, posed a pertinent question: “How many people in this room experience gender?” Everyone in the room raised their hands. “So wouldn’t you say that’s primary care?” Forcier responded. “To not know this care, at this point in time, is not okay,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The panel discussion, “Trans Voices in Trans Research: Envisioning a Trans-Centered Public Health Research Agenda,” featured three professionals in the field of trans health — Forcier; Laura Jacobs, psychotherapist, activist and author; and Dr. Scout, vice president of social justice at The Torvus Group. According to Don Operario, associate dean for academic affairs at the School of Public Health, one of the factors that prompted the event was “the call from our students to respond to one of the articles published by our faculty members.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A study authored by Lisa Littman, assistant professor of the practice of behavioral and social sciences in the School of Public Health, defined a phenomenon called “rapid-onset gender dysphoria” which “is observed to begin suddenly during or after puberty in an adolescent or young adult who would not have met criteria for gender dysphoria in childhood,” according to the study. Littman suggested that “rapid-onset gender dysphoria” spreads as “social contagion.” The study, published in August, was met with widespread media attention and criticism over its methodology and conclusions, and the University removed the associated press release from its website and news distribution, The Herald previously reported. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Operario added that the purpose of the panel discussion was to work alongside the University’s process to “reaffirm our commitment to health equity and to the wellness of the trans population and to reaffirm our commitment to academic freedom, to the best quality and actually applying our science to help uplift the wellness of all communities,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jacobs spoke about the importance of authenticity and representation in scientific research. She emphasized the importance of increasing accountability for researchers and spokespersons whose values are antithetical to the values of the trans community. Jacobs explained that the limit to academic freedom is academic dishonesty, poor methodology or studies coming from a place of stigma. “Research doesn’t just live in academia. Harmful research causes harm. It makes it harder for people to get care. That means they live more difficult lives,” Jacobs added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Forcier also spoke about the ways in which trans youth should be supported by their parents. “Data says there is a huge importance of family and community support and acceptance. And this support and acceptance is associated with positive health outcomes,” she said. Forcier also stressed the importance of language and paradigms by citing a study suggesting that using children’s chosen name and pronouns can protect against suicidality. “Everybody takes a different path to gender and we need to respect those different paths,” she added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Scout focused on the need for systematic changes in institutes as “problematic research structures can create problematic findings.” He looked at the progress of the National Institutes of Health, which could be a model for the University, he said, noting some of the improvements made by the NIH to diversify their employee pool. He emphasized the importance of involving trans people in research about their communities and observed how the NIH had “a special meeting of external trans experts to come in and tell them what the research priorities were,” he said. “This is an opportunity to listen. More importantly, this is the opportunity for action. It is an opportunity for Brown to become a leader in this field,” Scout added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Laura Sobik, clinical psychologist and assistant director of Counseling and Psychological Services, attended the event and described the speakers as phenomenal advocates and leading voices in trans equity and social justice who were “speaking for those who don’t have or cannot use their voice.” Following the publication of the research that was referenced in the event, many psychologists at CAPS “have been working with students who have been personally or collectively harmed and in pain because of it,” Sobik added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Researchers aim to reduce suicides among former prisoners</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">A new $1 million grant was added to a $6.8 million study from 2015 attempting to determine intentionality of opioid overdoses in people recently released from prison. Former prisoners are at high risk of mental illness and drug relapse, making them highly susceptible to suicide, said Jennifer Johnson, professor of public health at Michigan State University.</p>
<p class="p4">The ongoing study aims to determine interventions to reduce suicide, Johnson said. If the research is effective, this would reduce 5 to 9 percent of all U.S. suicides, she said. “The goal with the new million-dollar project is to better inform emergency departments and emergency responders” of what kind of treatment may be effective, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">“This study was designed specifically to address suicide risk in individuals who were transitioning from jail detention back to their community,” said Lauren Weinstock, associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior. “With additional funding, we can start looking a little bit more at how opioid addiction and drug addiction affects suicide behaviors.”</p>
<p class="p4">The study, which orginally intended to research suicide prevention for society in general, found that those at a higher risk were recently released prisoners, Johnson said. The study “shows how suicide and substance use co-occur in our population,” she added. More than half of incarcerated people have substance abuse problems, she said.</p>
<p class="p4">“Ten percent of all suicides with known causes occurred in the context of a recent criminal or legal stressor,” Johnson said. Studying people in jail “was a way to identify people at risk for suicide in the community … who are not in contact with formal treatment services.”</p>
<p class="p4">“Risk of death soon after discharge from prison due to overdose is very high,” said Stephen Buka, professor of epidemiology.</p>
<p class="p4">However, the “proportion of the opioid overdose deaths that we’ve seen can be attributed to suicide rather than drug overdose,” Weinstock said. The researchers followed the former prisoners for up to a year after they were released and observed that many of them had considered using opioids for suicidal purposes, Weinstock said. These “people have contemplated that (overdose) would appear accidental so that their loved ones wouldn’t necessarily know that they’ve committed suicide,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">“There are people who get into drugs to self-medicate their problems,” said Josiah Rich, professor of medicine and epidemiology. “We see some folks who are suicidal because they feel they can’t recover from substance abuse.”</p>
<p class="p4">Further, many people go to the emergency department either from intentional or unintentional overdose, but they decline future treatment, Weinstock said. The researchers spoke to health care providers across the country who had seen overdose patients and found that these providers assumed the overdoses were accidental, Johnson said.</p>
<p class="p4">When people are going through withdrawal from opioids, they are less likely to tell health care providers they were suicidal so that the hospital does not hold them, Rich said. Since people do not want to experience the symptoms of withdrawal, they do not seek further treatment, Johnson said.</p>
<p class="p4">But researchers are interested in finding more effective treatments. “It doesn’t surprise me that (the former prisoners) are candid with researchers (who) are all about the mental health needs of the ex-prisoners and are there in the context of help,” Buka said.</p>
<p class="p4">Researchers are also looking at intervention methods already being implemented in prisons.</p>
<p class="p4">Whereas European nations work to treat addiction in prisoners, the United States does not have a treatment plan, Rich said. “Rhode Island prisons are way ahead of the curve in providing treatment and counseling to those who are addicted to opioids while they are in prison,” Buka said.</p>
<p class="p4">Access to opioids is extremely dangerous for someone who is at risk for suicide, Johnson said. “One important consideration is minimizing access to opioids as a means for someone having access for an overdose,” she added.</p>
<p class="p4">Ninety percent of people who detox from addiction end up relapsing, Rich said. “Now is the most dangerous time ever to use opioids because they are contaminated. When you relapse and you’ve lost your tolerance, you’re set up for an overdose,” he added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Brown researchers studying the degeneration of neurons in worm models with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis recently found that different types of neurons undergo different mechanisms of decay.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Their paper focused on developing models to study how the SOD1 gene, which is associated with ALS, affects neurons and their degeneration. The findings contest the commonly accepted idea that all neurons affected by ALS degenerate in the same way, according to Saba Baskoylu, the lead author of the project. Previous worm models were not able to examine how this single gene affects the nervous system of C. elegans, a species of roundworm, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the past six years, a team of researchers led by Anne Hart, professor of neuroscience, has been developing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>C. elegans models to study neurodegeneration caused by ALS. “Why use worms? Because they are much less expensive to work with than cell or larger animal models — and neuron(s) act pretty much the same way in all animals,” Hart wrote in an email to The Herald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The worm models are also much faster and simpler to use than those of other organisms, she added.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The project began with the goal of developing more accurate C. elegans models to study ALS progression but led to the discovery that neurons undergo different pathways of degeneration. “Our aim was to create a model in C. elegans that could shed light on why specific neurons die in ALS — and to more accurately represent the human disease in a small invertebrate model,” Hart said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Using a genetic engineering technique to modify the SOD1 gene, the researchers were able to create animal models to study the disease in a simpler organism, Baskoylu said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The researchers labeled the worm’s neurons with fluorescence and used the visible color to detect the presence of specific neurons, looking for signs of degeneration. “When we first generated (the modified worms), they looked quite okay, and we didn’t see any of these defects … until we exposed the animals to stress,” which led to neurodegeneration, Baskoylu said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the study’s key findings provides evidence that the two different types of neurons affected by ALS — glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— might decay through different mechanisms, Baskoylu said. When the naturally-occurring, unaltered gene was put back into the glutamatergic neurons, the neurodegeneration stopped and the cells were “rescued,” but when this gene was put back into the cholinergic neurons, the damage could not be stopped.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the future, new projects could look at ways to combat this degeneration, Baskoylu said. “Now that we have neurodegeneration in these two types of neurons, we can attempt to rescue these degeneration defects,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These “models for ALS —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and other diseases — will provide unique insights into why neurons die and help us find ways to stop this. We are working with our collaborators at Brown and elsewhere to harness these models to understand this devastating, incurable disease,” Hart wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study succeeded at developing a simple system to study ALS and was “a very well done, impressive piece of work,” said<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kenneth Fischbeck, a neurologist at the National Institutes of Health.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s surprising that the loss and gain (of gene function) work on different neurotransmitter systems separately. That’s new to me, and I think maybe to the field,” he said. This research could be helpful for the development of new ALS treatments by potentially using the worms to test out new therapies, he noted.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Families who receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program use fewer discount coupons and allot more money for spending on food than they would without assistance, according to a forthcoming paper in the American Economic Review by Justine Hastings and Jesse Shapiro, professors of economics.</p>
<p class="p4">In 2017, the SNAP program served about one in six families, Hastings explained. Recipients can access their benefits through an Electronic Benefits Transfer card and can use the money to purchase pre-approved food products at specific retail stores, according to Benefits.gov.</p>
<p class="p4">The study found that “every $100 in SNAP benefits leads to between $50 and $60 extra dollars of food spending each month,” Hastings wrote in an email to The Herald. Cash benefits of the same amount are not predicted to have the same effect, she added. Furthermore, the study found that SNAP recipient households are slightly less likely to buy store brands and redeem discount coupons on SNAP-eligible food products.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Understanding if “SNAP has larger effects on food spending than cash benefits would is important for understanding its effects on the economy and on the lives of recipients,” she wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">According to Shapiro, the authors’ ability to more accurately calculate estimates for the effect of SNAP on food spending sets this research apart from similar studies. In the working paper, the team analyzed over six billion data points.</p>
<p class="p4">“Justine Hastings and Jesse Shapiro are leaders in this movement to incorporate new sources of data, including scanner data, into policy research, ” wrote Gregory Bruich, an economics researcher and lecturer at Harvard, in an email to The Herald. Scanner data is composed of any data collected when an individual checks out at a grocery store — including payment method and loyalty program history — and can be analyzed to compare the behaviors of SNAP recipients with other shoppers. Bruich, who uses scanner data in his own research, wrote that the method not only yields larger samples sizes but also allows “researchers to develop more creative and more credible research designs than would be possible with standard survey data sets.”</p>
<p class="p4">A key concept that the study explores is “mental accounting,” a term devised by Richard Thaler, professor of economics at the University of Chicago and a 2017 Nobel Laureate, to describe a consumer’s tendency to set aside specific amounts of money for various categories of spending, Hastings wrote. Hastings provided an example of mental accounting in the context of SNAP benefits. If a household that spends $300 per month on food receives a $200 benefit from the program, they would potentially have $200 of cash for spending on other, non-food items as a result, making the SNAP benefits equivalent to a cash stipend. But the study found that, possibly because of mental accounting, SNAP recipients focus their spending of those benefits on food items.</p>
<p class="p4">Hastings is the founding director of Research Improving People’s Lives, a group working to make large data sets more comprehensible to policymakers. In partnership with Gov. Gina Raimondo and led by Hastings, the group launched in 2015 under a different name, the Rhode Island Innovative Policy Lab, according to RIPL’s website. The forthcoming study is specifically a part of RIPL’s Social Program Innovation initiative, which brings together scientists and facilitates work that “policymakers can use to effectively improve opportunity for everyday Americans,” Hastings wrote.</p>
<p class="p4">Both Hastings and Shapiro have been involved in many research projects on financial assistance for food expenses. Hastings started looking into federal food assistance roughly a decade ago as a professor at Yale, while Shapiro started work on the Food Stamp Program, which preceded SNAP as the main federal initiative, as a doctoral student at Harvard.</p>
<p class="p4">Hastings and Shapiro are currently engaged in further research into how SNAP impacts the nutritional “composition of purchased foods,” Shapiro wrote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>U. Professor integrates use of spinal taps in Alzheimer’s diagnosis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the battle to understand Alzheimer’s disease, advancements in the testing and development of new technologies aim to provide stronger support for treatment. In collaboration with a number of other researchers and the Alzheimer’s Association, Professor of Neurology Stephen Salloway has been developing new criteria for the use of lumbar punctures, also known as spinal taps, to diagnose Alzheimer’s. Helping patients clarify whether they should undergo this procedure may allow them to detect the disease sooner and begin treatment as early as 10 to 20 years before memory loss occurs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the lumbar puncture procedure, a needle is inserted into the spine to extract cerebrospinal fluid. This process allows scientists to analyze the fluid, monitoring the levels of two proteins in the brain and body known as amyloid and tau, said John Hendrix, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer’s Association. As the levels of these two proteins fluctuate, they can provide earlier indications of forms of dementia, including Alzheimer’s. This approach has become more prevalent as technologies, screenings and tests have advanced, Salloway said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This upcoming form of testing can also increase accuracy in diagnosing patients, said Leslie Shaw, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania, who is unaffiliated with the study. Alzheimer’s develops as a “continuum” with many stages, and research and testing allow for more educated and informed diagnoses at each stage to reduce rates of misdiagnosis and promote appropriate treatment, Shaw added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lumbar punctures are routine in Europe but are seldom used in the United States, Hendrix said. This may be a result of a fear of the procedure due to lack of awareness and knowledge of its mechanics — in reality, a spinal tap is a quick and effective procedure with few to no side effects, he added. Additionally, patients may doubt the procedure because of the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>belief that testing for dementia is futile due to the absence of a cure, Salloway said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">More conversation about this procedure could better educate the public and primary care physicians about the appropriate use of testing, which can lead to more accurate diagnoses and a more informed conversation on future treatment, Salloway said. “Alzheimer’s is probably our number one public health problem,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While some people who fear they have Alzheimer’s may wish to avoid treatment, the possibility of getting into a clinical trial early can greatly increase the chances and quality of treatment, Hendrix said. “It’s a really exciting time for this research, and one of the things that gives me great optimism is that these tools not only can help with more accurate diagnosis, but they will also help in finding new therapies,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In-depth PET scans to analyze tau proteins and blood and eye tests are also currently being researched as alternatives, Hendrix said. Blood testing is still being researched and is not currently in use, but may soon find applications as a preliminary screening test to lead into further procedures, Hendrix said. <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/20/alzheimers-study-may-provide-methods-prevention-economical-diagnosis/">Other research</a> being conducted at Brown involves using eye exams to analyze early retinal changes well before dementia and memory loss occurs, Salloway said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Care and support might not be a cure, but it does lead to better health, to better outcomes and to better quality of life,” Hendrix said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Study shows breastfed infants have higher stress tolerance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A study published this month illustrates a biological link between a mother’s breastfeeding and other nurturing behaviors on the health of her baby. The study showed that breastfeeding is associated with higher tolerance to stress, as indicated by difference levels in cortisol — ­a stress response hormone. Additionally, a second biomarker used was DNA samples from buccal cells, or cheek swabs, that showed the degree of suppression of genes related to stress.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study is the first to replicate animal studies investigating how mother-infant behavior can affect infant health using human participants, said Barry Lester, professor of psychiatry and pediatrics and lead author of the study. Previous studies were only performed on rodents, he added. In consideration of how the findings from animal studies apply to human studies, “if that were true in humans, the implications are staggering,” Lester said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study divided mother-infant pairs into two groups: one group of infants that was breastfed and another that was not. Infants that were breastfed saw lower levels of DNA methylation — a process that suppresses genes — of stress-related genes such as NR3C1.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“You can have a methylation test comparable to a blood test that can determine your methylation,” Lester said. “If moms are depressed during pregnancy, the fetus also has increased methylation of NR3C1, and (cortisol is) more reactive at birth.” But there is not yet a biomarker currently available for use in screenings or treatment, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study demonstrates “the importance of supporting the early caregiving environment and how critical it is for helping children to develop appropriate stress response systems … (and) coping patterns,” said Elisabeth Conradt, assistant professor of developmental psychology at the University of Utah and an author of the study. Conradt also expressed the importance of not shaming those who are unable to breastfeed. "There are many challenges associated with breastfeeding and we shouldn’t assume that all parents are able to do it,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both Lester and Conradt agreed on the need for follow-up studies to replicate these results."The sample size was lower than was ideal," Conradt said. “We are planning on performing a replicating study (at the University of Utah), … and we also hope to see some longitudinal studies.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“In the future, we can … look at other markers and behavioral parameters,”said Todd Levine, clinical associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior, who was unaffiliated with the study. Overall, the study has “strong implications for how we raise children,” Levine added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The research is “a point of pride” for the hospital, he said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a study of a species of brightly-flowering trees, a University professor used satellite imagery to observe how the trees’ population density affects their spread. The study’s design demonstrates that satellite imagery is a viable method of studying tree populations and opens the door for global ecological studies in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the population of the tree Handroanthus guayacan increased in size, it became more severely hunted by its predators. In this sense, there is “a penalty for getting too common,” said James Kellner, assistant professor of environmental studies and co-lead author of the study.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The study found evidence to support the idea that greater population size is tied to lower population density, as proposed by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, a foundational theory of ecology relating to the biodiversity of tropical forests. Scientists have studied how population density affects trees but never had empirical data to corroborate it, Kellner said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Using new remote-sensing technology, the study set out to quantify the observations of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, Kellner said. Several previous studies have examined how seeds or saplings are preyed upon in areas with a greater concentration of trees, but this is the first project to observe the actual changes in the population of a tree in a tropical forest, Kellner said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Using highly accurate satellite imagery, researchers looked at the canopy of trees on Barro Colorado Island, Panama to see when each individual H. guayacan tree flowered. They also measured the population and location of these trees over a period of 10 years with satellite photos and by manually counting each tree, Kellner said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Along the way, Kellner had to find a statistical and mathematical way to account for any possible data inaccuracies, such as random anomalies or overhead clouds. “If you have a tree that happens not to flower for a given year, but it’s alive, you don’t want to say it died. So you have to have a way of estimating how many trees were not detected in a given census interval,” said Stephen Hubbell, former professor at University of California, Los Angeles and co-lead author of the paper. Using various statistical methods, Kellner was able to compensate for these types of challenges and improve the accuracy of his data set, Hubbell added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the principal implications of this paper is the precedent it sets for future research into global ecology using satellite imaging, Hubbell said. “I think the most important finding is that, by using tools to identify canopy trees of individual species, and by taking long-term data, we can actually measure the population dynamics of rare tropical tree species,” he said. This type of science will play a key role in providing data for conservation efforts, climate change and habitat loss, Hubbell added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Working with Planet Labs, a California-based company that designs and sends shoebox-sized satellites called “cube sats” into orbit, Kellner and Hubbell anticipate being able to take a snapshot of the entire Earth every single day. Planet Labs’ “imaging constellation can uniquely observe changes in large tropical trees every day the sky is clear, enabling ecologists like Jim to develop truly novel science,” wrote Joseph Mascaro, director of academic programs at Planet Labs, in an email to The Herald. The global impact this kind of data and research can have across many disciplines “is fundamentally game-changing,” Kellner said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Med School promotes humanistic medicine</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">At the end of a year dissecting and studying cadavers, first-year students at the Alpert Medical School host an annual Ceremony of Gratitude. Each May, they meet and thank the families of those who donated their bodies to help students understand human anatomy. During the ceremony, students express their gratitude through poetry and speeches, dances and hand-written cards. Despite working with these bodies for the past year, students do not learn the first names of the donors until the flower ceremony during the Ceremony of Gratitude.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This ceremony serves as one of the many ways that students at the Med School strive to remember and reflect on individuals as people instead of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>just as bodies they interact with. Humanistic practices are incorporated into classes and scholarly concentrations, electives, extracurriculars and reflection sessions.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Brown has taken a lead in thoughtfully incorporating critical topics that have previously been neglected into curricula, such as LGBTQ+ patient care, racism and transgender medicine, said Steven Rougas, assistant professor of medical science and emergency medicine.</p>
<p class="p2">Medical students first learn and practice patient-centered communication through Doctoring, a clinical skills training program for first- and second-year students. Based on a collection of poems and essays entitled “On Doctoring,” the program teaches topics such as medical interviewing, administering a physical exam and presenting an oral case, as well as “thinking about the patient as a whole,” said Rougas, who directs the program.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Each class is typically made up of eight or nine students and is taught by both a physician and a social behavioral sciences faculty member who comes from a background such as nursing, pastoral care, education or social work. The combination of a physician and a non-physician perspective “allows for a more interprofessional approach,” Rougas said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We help students navigate how to respond empathetically, how to use reflective listening (and) how to utilize what the patient’s telling you and their story to respond appropriately based on their needs,” Rougas explained. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The program “helps students start thinking about the transformation that takes place in a person when they decide to become a physician,” said Elizabeth Toll, clinical associate professor of medicine and pediatrics, who teaches one of the courses. This transformation includes coping with emotions that may arise during “really basic things like cutting into a cadaver (and) realizing that people will start telling you the most private stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The majority of the course is hands-on. Students practice communication not only with their peers and faculty members, but also with patients through the Med School’s standardized patient program. After these practice sessions, students are given weekly feedback about whether the patient felt that they were heard and acknowledged compassionately. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The program attempts to “instill structural awareness and competency, which is a way of thinking about individuals from many different facets” including their family life, home life and medical experience, as well as race, age, gender identity and sexual orientation, Rougas added.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“One of the mantras we have is that these things are important because they help us take the best care of patients,” Rougas said. The Med School teaches these topics within the first two years so that third- and fourth-year students, who spend most of their time working with patients, are ready to provide compassionate care, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Up to 15 percent of fourth-year students can be nominated by their peers and faculty for the Gold Humanism Honor Society, a national organization whose “mission is to support and promote the values of humanism and professionalism in medicine,” said Fred Schiffman, faculty advisor to the society and professor of humanistic medicine. The society promotes projects at the Med School that explore the intersection of medicine with museums and art, narratives and poetry, spirituality, food insecurity and other topics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For instance, Schiffman aims to use meditation and mindfulness to discuss patients “as people, not only as their physical” diagnoses by co-teaching a human physical diagnosis course, he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“It’s truly an honor to see patients who uniformly love the attention they get from these students who are not just looking at a physical finding, such as an abnormal wrist or a heart murmur,” Schiffman said. “We challenge students to get to know patients as people in a very short period of time.”</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Schiffman has also taught courses that address “cultural approaches to death and dying,” as well as a joint Rhode Island School of Design-Brown course on communicating medical risk. </span></p>
<p class="p2">In addition to the LGBTQ Healthcareand Advocacy concentration, the Med School also offers several scholarly concentrations that touch on humanistic medicine, including Medical Humanities and Ethics, Caring for Underserved Communities and Physician as Communicator. Course electives such as medical illustration and narrative medicine further help students think about patients’ stories, Toll explained.</p>
<p class="p2">Toll cited several aspects of humanistic medicine as most meaningful to her: a deep interest in patient narratives, a desire to take time for patients, an incorporation of creativity and community involvement. At the Med School, these opportunities manifest in elective courses and extracurriculars, such as volunteering at Clinica Esperanza, a free clinic in Providence for people who are uninsured.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, Toll also emphasizes the importance of self-reflection during this process. Toll hopes that having students write reflections, take their first two years of medical school pass/fail and learn from faculty members who practice humanistic medicine will teach them to take time for themselves and their patients.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Reflection sessions also serve as a critical part of the required anatomy course for first-years. Though initially given only the cadaver donor’s occupation, age when they passed away and cause of death, students often learn about the donor as they perform the dissection and uncover implants or tattoos, said Naaman Mehta MD’21 and Alicia Hersey MD’20.</p>
<p class="p2">The dissections are “an intense experience, so it’s nice to have sessions where people can talk about how they feel,” Mehta said.</p>
<p class="p2">Dale Ritter, senior lecturer in biology who teaches the anatomy course, said that he eases students into working with cadavers by first talking about how the cadaver donors all chose to give their bodies for study. After conversations about where the bodies come from and how they will be dissected, students are shown an undissected cadaver and then a dissected cadaver before they are finally are taught to perform the procedure in groups of five.</p>
<p class="p2">Both Mehta and Hersey sat on their first-year student committees, which organize the annual Ceremony of Gratitude. As members of the reflections sub-committee, they also facilitated sessions throughout the year that allowed students to think deeply about how it felt to work with human bodies. The session prior to the Ceremony of Gratitude entailed letter-writing to the families.</p>
<p class="p2">Hersey said that the opportunity for students to meet the families helped them humanize and reflect on their anatomy experience after the course was over.</p>
<p class="p2">This past year, around 70 families attended the ceremony, Mehta added.</p>
<p class="p2">“It’s more than just working with cadavers,” Mehta said. “It’s about understanding why we’re in the lab and what bodies may suffer from while they’re living.”</p>
<p class="p2">Toll views humanistic medicine as taking a step back from the technicalities and “being human beings as we encounter human beings in our care,” she said. “I’ve always thought that my personal reason for wanting to be a doctor was to answer the question: What does it mean to be a human being?”</p>

		<title>Vulnerabilities found in terahertz communication</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">While the future of data transmission may lie in the hands of terahertz technology, there is still a ways to go until it is crowned heir to the tech throne. A recent study showed that transmissions in terahertz waves are still as vulnerable to eavesdropping as other forms of communication such as microwave transmissions.</p>
<p class="p2">Terahertz communications use a range of transmissions that are still being analyzed and researched, but they show great promise, said Jianjun Ma, a postdoctoral research associate and co-author of the study. While traditional microwave technology transmits megabytes of data per second, terahertz technology could accommodate transmissions of up to a thousand gigabytes per second, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">In its current state, the angle of terahertz transmission is very narrow ­— close to 4 degrees ­— which means that it is more secure than traditional methods, said Daniel Mittleman, professor of engineering and co-author of the study. Because of this, the sender and receiver need to be facing each other to allow for proper communication. Microwaves, on the other hand, have an angle of transmission close to 120 degrees. While this wide angle allows for greater convenience, it also provides a wider net for eavesdropping and interception of messages, he said. Additionally, terahertz transmissions must be conducted across short distances of up to one or two kilometers, as the waves are affected by the atmosphere, Ma added.</p>
<p class="p2">The researchers sought to test if terahertz transmissions were as vulnerable to eavesdropping as microwave transmissions are. Hardly anyone is asking, “‘What are (the) security implications associated with that change?’” Mittleman said. Using different shapes of metal items, like plates and pipes, the team was able to fully intercept a transmission when the object was placed at the edge of the 4-degree angle, allowing for a scattered portion of the message to be shot out and received by an eavesdropper, he said. This showed that while terahertz transmissions have a lower risk of eavesdropping due to their narrow angle, they are still vulnerable to interception, Mittleman added.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite their limitations, terahertz transmissions can be applied to both current technology and future endeavors, Ma said. Faster communications between phones, laptops and even satellites could be feasible, he added. “It’s not going to replace existing wireless (technology), but when you need a really, really high data rate, and you only want to go 100 meters, it’s going to be the way to go,” Mittleman said.</p>
<p class="p2">Following this experiment, the team hopes to further test the functionality of terahertz transmissions in various weather conditions as well as explore different antennas and lenses which could make the angle of transmission even narrower, Ma said.</p>
<p class="p2">Terahertz transmissions may be seen as the future of wireless data communication within the next 10 years, Mittleman said. As new generations of communication, such as 5G data, proliferate, bandwidth will become crowded and slow due to a growing number of wireless and Bluetooth devices. Terahertz may shine as a viable way to avoid crowded spaces and allow for fast and efficient communication.</p>
<p class="p2">“We see terahertz wireless as inevitable one day, and so we better start solving the problems now,” Mittleman added.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Child outcomes affected by father’s background</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Teenage mothers are often blamed for the hard circumstances that their children may face, but fathers may play a role in the future success of their children, according to a new study co-authored by Anna Aizer, professor of economics. The research analyzed administrative data sets from Norway and found that the father’s background plays a key role in the child’s development and life outcomes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The group looked into IQ, schooling, earnings at age 30, welfare status and other factors to measure the differences in outcomes between adults who had teen mothers and those who did not, Aizer said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study suggests that the underlying disadvantage of the mother compounded with that of the father is what is really responsible for lower outcomes in their children — not just the mother’s position, Aizer said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A novel component of this study was that it examined the fathers of children born to teen mothers. Kjell Salvanes, co-author of the paper, explained that the tax system in Norway creates a strong incentive for mothers to report who the father of their child is at the time of birth, even if he is not present. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“Not only are the mothers who give birth as teenagers very different, but so are the partners, so are the fathers — they are younger, they have lower IQs. That explains part of the worse outcomes that you see for these kids,” Aizer said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Surprisingly, when studying children of teenage mothers, the average age of the father was not below 20 as one might expect, but instead about 26, Aizer said. In 2011, the average age of all Norwegian fathers was 33.4 years old, according to the Norwegian government.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To understand the influence that fathers have on these children, fathers’ backgrounds and their presence around their children are important, Salvanes said. This approach may help form policies designed to help children born to disadvantaged households or teen parents who may subsequently perform unfavorably in school and the labor market. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The paper worked to further investigate whether teen childbearing itself was the root cause of weaker outcomes, or if these were because of economic disadvantages that teen mothers face, said Phillip Levine P’16, a professor of economics at Wellesley College, who was not associated with this paper.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An important aspect of the study was its control of the background of teen mothers. The study ensured that there were no cross comparisons between dissimilar mothers. By controlling the experiment, the study was able to show that “being born to a teen mother is a little bit detrimental to a child’s subsequent outcomes, but not as bad as the raw differential would make it seem,” Levine said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The authors relied on birth cohorts going back to 1950, Salvanes said. He added that since the administrative data set comprises the whole population and is comprehensive, unlike U.S. data, researchers can make claims about specific groups and analyze an individual’s progress over several decades. This allows researchers to trace a child from birth to adulthood and examine different data points collected along that trajectory. </span></p>
<p class="p4">“You really can’t do a study like this with U.S. data,” Aizer said. Previous American-based studies used survey data, which may “stymie” research efforts, she added. Data collected via surveys in the United States cannot account for a father who is not present at the time of birth if no name is provided, thus limiting domestic studies.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Understanding whether or not teenage motherhood impacts the child is important given the declining, though relatively high, rate of teen pregnancy in the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“The real contribution of this paper is a lot better data. Work that has been done in the United States tends to use smaller samples (and) outcomes aren’t measured as well,” Levine said. He added that the use of the Norwegian data presents both strengths and weaknesses — though it allows for better, deeper analysis of the information available, it also raises concerns that the trends can not be extended to the American population. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“It’s an important and influential paper,” Levine concluded. It may set a foundation for future studies in the field, Aizer added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">From broken bones to concussions, injuries afflict millions across the United States. While some may appear common and of minimal consequence in the long term, they can quickly drain individuals’ pockets and well-being. In response, Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics Mark Zonfrillo ’99 MD ’03 led a study that determined the costs and prevalence of nonfatal injuries. The study uniquely aimed to quantify and break down not only the financial burden of medical spending but also the impact from job loss and quality of life. Using statistics from 2013, the study found that the 31 million nonfatal injuries from that year cost about $1.853 trillion, with over a trillion of that amount stemming from a decrease in quality of life.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking at the results, the $1.8 trillion is “an astronomical value,” Zonfrillo said. “If you think about the injuries occurring to all U.S. citizens in one year and the sort of lifetime cost as the result of those injuries, it is profound.” The results also illustrated that nonfatal injuries are common issues, affecting about one in every 10 people annually in the United States. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The analysis of nonfatal injuries contributes to the study’s significance. “Deaths are just the tip of the pyramid when it comes to the burden of injuries,” wrote Abdulgafoor Bachani, assistant professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, in an email to The Herald. He was not involved in this study but has done research on the socioeconomic and health-related effects of injuries in nations with lower average incomes than the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the study was published in October, analysis of the data began around February 2017, Zonfrillo said. The team collected data from injured patients across emergency department visits and hospitalizations and surveyed the medical reports to classify the injuries. In recent years, the number of states classifying injuries has increased, which gave the team better data for their analysis, said Bruce Lawrence, a research scientist at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation and a co-author of the study. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Assessment of the decrease in quality of life also set this study apart. While the U.S. government has only recently tried to perfect a method of quantifying quality of life, the team tried to put this methodology to use for its analysis, which allowed researchers to obtain a more holistic picture of the financial impact of injuries, beyond traditional metrics. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The statistics for the study were five years old, but Zonfrillo said more recent data would not be significantly different. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even with the study’s improved methodology, the $1.8 trillion price tag may not encapsulate the full cost of nonfatal injuries. Traumatic brain injuries and spinal cord injuries — the most costly categories studied — cause long-term consequences and their financial impacts are difficult to quantify. “Because the impact (of TBI and spinal cord injuries) is lifelong, it’s hard for any one study to get at the full impact. You have to follow a patient for so many years that it’s hard to study,” Lawrence said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Zonfrillo has prior experience with research on injury epidemiology, and the repercussions of injuries encouraged him to conduct the study in the first place. Noticing the preventability and cost of nonfatal injuries, he hopes that his work will help decrease their prevalence in the United States. “(Injuries are) one of the leading causes of death and disability (in) people of all ages, and they’re very costly,” he said. But educational initiatives, economic incentives, enforcement of policy measures and engineering can all help prevent injuries.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the past, similar research has influenced legislation. “Most dangerous products tend to bring policy responses to make them safer,” Zonfrillo said. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has used injury cost analyses to identify harmful products and address their dangers, he added. Finding solutions is not easy, however; falls — the primary cause of injuries nationally, with over eight million cases in 2013 — vary so widely in type and root cause that creating a common means of prevention is challenging.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Going forward, Lawrence believes the results from this study may help governments decide which injuries should command their attention and resources. “From a policy standpoint, (the data) would help government officials in charge of health and safety policy when they’re determining where to put their emphasis with respect to different types of health problems,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They could use this information to compare to other health problems.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bachani also believes that approaching the problem through economics “can assist us in making a better case for more investments in injury prevention interventions and programs that are very cost-effective compared to other public health interventions,” he added in his email to The Herald.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Researchers explore method to make metals stronger</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As research in engineering leads to advancements in design, technology and methods, scientists strive to strengthen materials. University researchers recently analyzed the benefits of gradient nanotwin boundaries — tiny linear divisions with identical structures on either side — in certain metals, such as copper.
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The main areas studied were the overall strength of the copper and its ability to stretch. As a metal becomes stronger, it cannot be stretched as much. This “trade-off has been a long-standing dilemma in materials science,” wrote Zhiwei Ma, postdoctoral research associate, in an email to The Herald. “We were looking to find a way of enhancing the strength of steel at no ductility trade-off.” In the metals with gradient nanotwin boundaries, however, this trade-off was rarely seen, Ma added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It becomes essential to understand how the micro, nanostructure controls the property of metals,” said Huajian Gao, professor of engineering and co-lead researcher of the study.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The symmetry of nanotwin boundaries enhances the metal’s properties and further impedes dislocation. “They are one of the most perfect grain boundaries,” Gao said. These nanotwin boundaries reinforce the metal and increase its overall strength, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nanotwin boundaries are one form of grain boundaries, which are divisions within the nanostructure of a metal that reinforce it, Gao said. These boundaries only form in certain metals, such as copper and gold, and reinforce natural atomic defects that slowly pass through the metal, he added. The slowing of this process without stopping it entirely is crucial; if these defects are impeded altogether, the metal becomes brittle and weak, but if the defects pass through with ease, the metal will wear down.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Researchers strive for this ideal zone to optimize metals. “Metal is used as a structural material everywhere; it is one of the most important materials in engineering,” Gao said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to the introduction of twin boundaries, the use of a graded texture from coarse to dense, or vice versa, lessens the weakness of a uniform nanostructure. This creates a more diverse inner working of the metal, further strengthening it, Ma said. “We’re trying to mimic nature,” Gao said, alluding to the wide variety of organic materials, such as bone and wood.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The team hopes to see similar applications with the use of high entropy alloys, which comprise equal parts of five or more metals, as opposed to traditional alloys with a majority composition of one metal, Ma said. This equal distribution allows for easier manipulation of the alloy’s properties to match a given metal, Gao added. Specifically, steel alloys can benefit from these nanostructures to enhance performance in axles in machines and transmissions systems in a number of industries, Ma said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it may take a few years to understand the full scope of the ways nanotwins can affect metals, Gao is hopeful to see their use in a wide range of products. “We still have to understand them first. We have to develop road maps to figure out how to go from here to there,” Gao said. As knowledge of the field increases, these alloys and material science methods could be used in handheld technology, aerospace engineering and car manufacturing, Gao said. “Maybe in the next decade or two we’ll see a lot of breakthroughs in material technology, … (but) now we’re just trying to understand from a basic science point of view how it all works,” he added.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>U. study examines link between alcohol consumption, memory</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A University study published last month shows that a pathway for making memories is changed when alcohol, even in small amounts, is consumed — a finding that has implications for understanding addiction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The researchers investigated the role that environmental cues play in memory and addiction, wrote Karla Kaun, assistant professor of neuroscience and principal investigator, in an email to The Herald. “While you are drinking, you are forming memories for cues in your environment, like the feel of the glass or the bouquet of your wine, that become associated with the feeling of being intoxicated,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study examined flies and showed that the consumption of alcohol affects the Notch pathway, a cell-signaling pathway that remains unaltered as species evolve and is associated with the misregulation of a gene that influences memory formation. Specifically, this gene is involved in associative learning, which is a mechanism for addiction.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“We speculate that this contributes to why memories for cues associated with addictive substances like alcohol and other drugs of abuse are so long-lasting, and can trigger relapse events in people recovering from alcohol or substance-use disorders,” Kaun wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study chose to test flies because researchers can use “tools available for precise manipulation of genes,” particularly for neurons and circuits, Kaun wrote.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Emily Petruccelli, assistant professor of biology at Southern Illinois University and lead author of the paper, added that “fruit flies are really amenable to genetic manipulation and … have a much more rapid lifespan.” This allowed the researchers to quickly test a variety of techniques, such as brain staining and microscopy, and approach the problem from diverse angles. “In general, the fly is really good for testing kind of off-the-wall or crazy, weird ideas,” Petruccelli said. Flies let researchers find “new, unexpected things that we can go on and test later,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study can help other researchers form their own hypotheses on mammalian models. “This could be something that kickstarts a really big domino effect because the pathway can control a lot of different genes,” Petruccelli said. “Mammalian researchers will know where to look” in future studies, she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“I find it very … interesting that this Notch pathway has a role … that’s related to alcohol memory,” said Ulrike Heberlein, a senior fellow at the Janelia Research Campus who was unaffiliated with the study. This study “provides not only some really exciting new scientific insight but it also provides potential for eventual development of therapies for alcoholism,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since researchers know the Notch pathway changes with alcohol consumption, “we can now start to look to see if drugs that affect Notch signaling could potentially alleviate cravings,” Kaun wrote. She also hopes to identify which genes the Notch pathway targets and gain a better understanding of the mechanisms behind cravings, she added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A new study by University researchers aimed to measure the amount of pain patients experience through brain activity, which could improve pain medications and treatments. Led by Carl Saab, associate professor of research in the departments of neuroscience and neurosurgery, the study sought to identify a more objective way to measure pain. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, medical professionals evaluate pain on a visual analogue scale, or VAS, Saab said. Patients choose a number from one to 10 and a facial expression to indicate their pain level.“In order for drugs to be developed, you need a powerful screen to test for efficacy. Current screens for pain are not reliable and subjective,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Researchers attached electroencephalogram pads to rats and analyzed their pain reactions. “Your brain is filled with billions of cells called neurons, and they work by sending electrochemical signals from one to the other,” said Joshua Levitt ScM ’17, clinical research Program coordinator at Rhode Island Hospital. “When you have lots of neurons doing the same thing at once, this creates patterns called oscillations, which are picked up by the EEG electrodes,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These brainwaves are analogous to sound waves, Levitt said; just as certain sound waves correlate to specific musical notes, brainwaves correlate to specific brain functions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are many causes for the variation in brainwave patterns, and scientists can model the effects pain and medications have on brain activity, said Samuel Neymotin, assistant professor of neuroscience research.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Researchers tracked these oscillations and induced pain by poking the rats and exposing them to hot temperatures, Saab said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This study represents an early step in quantifying animal pain, Saab said. “EEG is fast, and it records neural activity at a fast rate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s cheap, user-friendly and noninvasive, he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">First, the researchers are planning to use EEG data in veterinary hospitals, Saab said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Similarities in neural circuitry for pain in animals and humans indicate that this method could be applied to human subjects in the future, Saab said. “At the end of the day, I am interested in their verbal report of what their pain is,” he added. “Ultimately, it ought to be possible to correlate EEG pattern of activity with VAS.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“For chronic types of pain, that are defined as pain lasting more than 6 months, (patients) become resistant to traditional treatment,” Saab said, which suggests that traditional methods of pain measurement may be less reliable. In these cases, doctors often overprescribe highly addictive opioid medications. “You would want to intervene with more effective drugs that are not opioid-based,” Saab said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Next would be to pursue the human paths and validate what we have discovered,” Saab said. EEG could be particularly helpful for young populations, since children and babies have trouble verbalizing pain. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Individuals with different conditions, including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, ADHD and Schizophrenia, may benefit from this research, which could give rise to better and more personalized treatment, Neymotin said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first glance, the soccer field at Moses Brown School contains little more than open space, two goals and a few stray balls. But underneath the field at the intersection of Hope and Lloyd Streets lies the ruins of a house dating back to 1884. Demolished in 1939, the house once belonged to the Sack family, longtime Providence residents. The ruins now serve as the dig site for the students of ARCH 1900: “Archaeology of College Hill.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this unique course, which was originally offered in 2006, students get the chance to conduct an archaeological dig without having to fly to a remote site or pay for travel expenses, said Alex Marko GS, who teaches the class. Most people get their first hands-on experience with archaeology in a field school on a one- to two-month assignment, but this class makes the field more accessible, Marko added. With hands-on experience, the course hopes to teach archaeological techniques and give students a better understanding of the history of the University’s surroundings, he said. “We want to use objects and context to try to understand people,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After digging for several weeks during the first half of the course, students learn how to analyze archaeological artifacts in the lab. Over the years, students have explored several spots close to the classroom, including the Quiet Green and the First Baptist Church of America.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Four years ago, students combed through housing records at the Rhode Island Historical Society and found evidence that the soccer fields at Moses Brown contained much more than what immediately met the eye. Multiple documents provided evidence that the site contained the ruins of the Sack family house, so the group began digging. After four years of work at the site, the exact locations of this year’s dig are new. Previous digs from past students indicated that the chosen spots held remains of the house’s foundation and possibly more. Students first marked off the area, then carefully peeled back decades of dirt class after class.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After digging for several weeks this fall, students have uncovered extensive remains at the site. Hours of digging, scraping and sifting through dirt have revealed significant portions of the house’s foundation, decorative tiles and dozens of nails that once held the home in place. In a flashy surprise, Yale Friend ’19, a student in the course this year, uncovered an inscribed ring at the site. Though the class has been unable to determine the ring’s origins, they are beginning to run lab experiments to unlock its mysteries. While they wait to analyze it in the lab, class members speculate that the object is either a class ring or commemorative of a special occasion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The digs have been conducted almost entirely by the students in Marko’s course, but the group invited sixth grade students from Moses Brown to visit the site as part of an effort to engage the students studying only a few hundred yards away. The course supports community interaction and participation in many other ways as well. Students are encouraged to have a final project that is “outward-facing” and makes the findings accessible — such as a presentation at a local school or conference, Marko said. A community dig day in October also helped bring local residents to the site to uncover artifacts for themselves. The class will present some of its findings in February alongside another archaeology class, ARCH 0317: “Heritage in the Metropolis: Remembering and Preserving the Urban Past,” as part of Providence’s Year of the City, which highlights the centuries of rich Providence history. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many of the course’s 13 students had little or no previous experience in archaeology prior to enrollment, Marko said. They came from diverse academic backgrounds but all wanted to learn about archaeology in a hands-on way, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Friend said that he was particularly excited about the opportunity to take a class that would let him get outside for a few hours during the week. “I love being outside, I love working with my hands and this gives me a break from normal lab work,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sasha Pinto ’21 enjoys learning about what an archaeologist does to uncover artifacts. “I had no concept of what an archaeologist did,” she said. “It gives you an appreciation for what’s underneath you everyday.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The class also lets students learn about history from perspectives that are not always covered in textbooks, especially those that are typically minimized in historical narratives such as women and people of color, said Rachel Gold ’19, a former Herald senior staff writer. “We can fill in a lot of gaps in the textual record,” she described. “Other than the fun of digging up the dirt, there’s a potential to learn about what the artifacts are saying together with what the texture of the dirt is saying,” she added. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Observing cells in petri dishes, pipetting biochemical solutions into glass tubes — these images often come to mind when one envisions cancer research. But Assistant Professor of Engineering and Molecular Pharmacology, Physiology and Biotechnology Ian Wong has taken a more comprehensive approach in his lab that primarily focuses on the emergence, early spread and behavior of cancer cells.</p>
<p class="p2">By incorporating computation and biotechnology into biology and chemistry, Wong — who could not be reached for comment — has developed his own community of multidisciplinary researchers that are not only trying to enhance the field, but are doing so through a multitude of lenses, said Susan Leggett GS, a member of Wong’s lab.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As one of the biology specialists in the lab, Leggett began working with Wong as a graduate student shortly after Wong came to the University. Along with the rest of the group, she has focused specifically on carcinoma — one of the most prevalent types of cancer that affects many of the cells that composing the epithelial tissue lining the body, she said. Leggett has dedicated significant attention to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process in which these high-plasticity epithelial cells change to more closely resemble cells that can move more freely about the body and cause harm. Leggett said that EMTs have been identified in some cancer patient tissues and account for “a lot of the fundamental changes (of cancer cells) that are being quantified.” Looking ahead, she added that “if we learn some fundamentals about this process, perhaps why it happens, when it happens, how to control it or reverse it, now we might have some translation targets” or clinical applications. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The research at Wong’s lab has also led to the discovery that, upon stimulation, cells can migrate while staying together, Leggett said. The team has explored this phenomenon by studying cells in a three-dimensional environment resembling that of an actual cell, a task that falls into Thomas Valentin’s GS area of expertise.</p>
<p class="p2">Valentin, who has been in the lab since September 2014, works with biomaterials and 3D printing and has created 3D-printed hydrogels out of synthetic polymers. What makes these hydrogels unique is their ability to conglomerate on their own after being taken apart, as well as their tendency to react and move, Valentin said. More recently, the researchers designed hydrogels that do not degrade easily and can therefore be used to build structures, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">The team 3D prints using stereolithography, which operates differently from more common 3D printers, Valentin said. The lab’s printers use a laser that converts liquid plastic into solid plastic, unlike conventional printers that shoot out melted plastic. “There are very few labs that I know of, at least in the United States, that use this strategy of 3D printing. The benefits are that it’s very fast, but it requires more complex chemistry,” Valentin said. These printers in the lab are also relatively old — from the ‘90s — but by prioritizing accuracy, speed and flexibility, the researchers have continued to use them. “I go into it, and I can change every single parameter within the printer that I want. It’s 100 percent customizable,” Valentin added.</p>
<p class="p2">Wong’s lab then brings the work from the bench to the screen by approaching the 3D modeling of these cancer cells through computer science and mathematics. Utilizing microscopic images and data to create computational models, Dhananjay Bhaskar GS has worked on digitally and mathematically representing communication between, and movement of, cancer cells. Within this area of research, topology — the study of figures and points in space — can be applied to understand the spread of cancer cells, and 3D image segmentation can serve to graphically recreate and quantify the three-dimensional shapes of cells observed in the hydrogels, a difficult task for which Bhaskar is currently generating algorithms.</p>
<p class="p2">In their research, the group has faced significant challenges. In addition to a shortage of proper equipment, “when you write models for a cellular and tissue scale, you have to take into account things that happen at the subcellular level,” such as cell signaling and forces between cells, Bhaskar said. “The key challenge for me is to develop models in concert with a great experimental data analysis and to make sure my models are realistic when, in reality, I calibrate my models using images that are taken from the microscope,” he added.</p>
<p class="p2">There are difficulties in the biological component of the research as well, Leggett said. Cancer can vary in every patient, but the lab has made progress in identifying even subtle changes in cell structure or function. “We developed a platform to be able to detect on a single-cell level” when a cell has undergone EMT, Leggett said. This technique may be used to detect cancer in animals and patients in the future, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">The group also hopes to expand upon their work in the near future. The team is excited by the idea of putting “tumor cells in a context of different types of metastatic niches,” and studying how cells react in these environments, Leggett said. They also hope to find a way to use drugs to prevent or reverse EMTs, she added.</p>
<p class="p2">With the multitude of STEM disciplines mixed into Wong’s lab, the team hopes to continue to improve and innovate in the field of oncology. “I’d never thought I’d work in a biomedical engineering lab when I first came here, but I’m glad I did because … I got to gain a lot of different perspectives and kind of a new toolbox … especially with how interdisciplinary our lab is,” Leggett said. “When we meet as a group to discuss (the projects), … people are tackling it from different ways of thinking, and that to me can make the research more powerful,” she added.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Valentin was originally drawn to the mentorship in the lab. “The way (Wong) manages is hands-on and hands-off,” adding that “(Wong) doesn’t want to necessarily limit us to one singular focus, which is just cancer. He kind of lets us find our passion and keeps it relatively related to his wheelhouse.” </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gokaslan P’18 reflects on path to chief of neurosurgery</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Ziya Gokaslan P’18 can trace his desire to be a doctor back to his childhood. His father was a surgeon, and his older brother is now an oncologist. Conversations centered on medicine were common in his childhood home, and he would go to the hospital with his father and observe doctors as they performed procedures and autopsies.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Today, Gokaslan is the chair of neurosurgery at the Alpert Medical School and chief of neurosurgery at the Rhode Island Hospital and Miriam Hospital. He leads a team of extremely specialized physicians, surgeons and researchers who work every day to push boundaries in patient care and scientific discovery. </span></p>
<p class="p4">“The mission of our department is to provide the most advanced and compassionate care to our patients, to train future leaders in neurosurgery and to advance our field through research and innovation,” Gokaslan wrote in his <a href="https://brownneurosurgery.com/chairmans-message/">chairman’s message</a>.</p>
<p class="p4">Gokaslan did not always intend to become a neurosurgeon. His initial interest was in cardiac surgery, but while in medical school he found the repetitive nature of the heart procedures he learned to be intellectually under-stimulating. He craved a challenge, and learning how to operate on the brain and spine offered exactly that. After rotating in neurosurgery, “I fell in love with it,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Gokaslan has since developed expertise in chordoma, a rare spinal cancer that leads to tumorous growths in the spine. “It is really one in a million in terms of its incidence in the United States,” he said, adding that there are roughly 350 estimated new cases per year.</p>
<p class="p4">About every four to six weeks, he sees a patient with chordoma — some of whom have traveled from across the globe to get his expert opinion or to have their tumor operated on at Rhode Island Hospital.</p>
<p class="p4">The disease originates in notochordal cells, which are cells that give rise to the discs that lie between each vertebrae in the spine. As they grow, chordoma tumors may destroy the nerves that run through the spaces they occupy, most commonly at the base of the skull or above the tailbone, thereby impairing functionality as the disease progresses, Gokaslan said. Some tumors have been seen to surpass even the size of a watermelon before they are removed, he added. At advanced stages, tumors may also spread to other regions of the body.</p>
<p class="p4">Though Gokaslan still spends roughly two days a week in the operating room performing spinal surgeries, his position as chief of neurosurgery, which he assumed in 2015, involves responsibilities ranging from administrative to educational to research-based work.</p>
<p class="p4">Gokaslan’s tenure as chair thus far has been characterized by extensive expansion. Not only has the size of the department grown, but new grant funding has facilitated novel research efforts involving collaborations between physicians at the Med School and scientists who run labs at the University, Gokaslan said.</p>
<p class="p4">“When I took over the position here, we had only six faculty members,” Gokaslan said. “We have now 14 faculty members. We had barely, maybe a laboratory, now we have six different laboratories.”</p>
<p class="p4">In addition to the new labs, the neurosurgery department has expanded its residency program, added a fellowship program and increased the number of patients they can take each year, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Gokaslan has also helped launch a neurological intensive care unit at the Rhode Island Hospital. “We have 18 beds (that) are dedicated to patients with neurosurgical disorders and stroke,” he said. “We have a dedicated neuroscience floor (and) a dedicated spine floor.”</p>
<p class="p4">Curtis Doberstein, professor of neurosurgery and a previous chair of the department who has been at the Med School for 23 years, said the recent growth has been “exponential.” He added, “as a department, from that 23-year perspective, it’s never been better — it has not even been close to better than this.”</p>
<p class="p4">“We have been able to do all of these things within the last three and a half years,” Gokaslan said. “I believe that our department is now a very comprehensive, highly competitive and fully integrated academic neurosurgery program.”</p>
<p class="p4">“Gokaslan is widely recognized as both a superb surgeon, particularly in the area of spinal oncology, but also for his national leadership in a number of our leading societies,” wrote M. Sean Grady, chair of neurosurgery at Penn, in an email to The Herald. Gokaslan currently serves as president of the Neurosurgery Foundation, according to the Brown Neurosurgery website.</p>
<p class="p4">For aspiring neurosurgeons, Gokaslan emphasized the importance of early involvement and the necessity of developing a deep understanding of the foundations of the nervous system. Neurosurgery is “a highly technical area,” Gokaslan said. “Sometimes it’s not exactly like how it is featured in the movies or TV series.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Twitter bots impact climate discussion, U. researchers find</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With President Trump actively denying the existence of climate change, views on the topic remain polarized. Conclusions from reports conducted by researchers and engineers often clash with personal opinions. A new study led by Thomas Marlow GS addresses this divide, analyzing the connections between political polarization and climate change on Twitter. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many conservatives dispute the concept of climate change — man-made climate change especially, Marlow said. “We’re interested in how that can be.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Marlow believes that one of the “big drivers” behind this denial is social media influence. “We’re scraping hundreds of thousands of tweets to see if there are patterns of certain … groups that speak about the issue in different ways,” said Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society who helped facilitate the project. The group also attempted to determine whether the tweets were genuine or from automated Twitter bots that promoted “certain discourses,” he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After tapping into the Twitter stream, which Marlow calls the “fire hose,” the researchers used a Python script to filter out tweets containing key words and phrases, such as “climate change” and “global warming.” The script was written by Sean Miller GS, a data science master’s student. From there, the group created a network depicting how the tweets within a specific topic are connected to one another and how they relate to other topics. Finally, the group fed the tweets into a botometer, a machine learning algorithm developed by separate research organizations, that takes in a twitter handle and returns the likelihood that the specific account is a bot. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The group ran a pilot study over a three-week period this past summer and gathered some preliminary results. Of their initial sample size of 144,000 users, the group found that roughly 23,000 were bots, Marlow said. Together, these bots were generating 20 percent of all tweets collected, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The group also found that there were two topics that dominated discourse: global warming itself and how the Trump administration and other nations are reacting to climate change. The topic that attracted the greatest number of bots was focused on a specific campaign on a climate policy in Canada. “98 percent of all tweets about that campaign and that policy were generated by bots,” Marlow said, “So, they’re prevalent.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We need to understand how discussions are taking place,” Roberts said, including “who is leading those discussions (and) who is manipulating those discussions.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“It is important, very important, to understand how opinions flow,” said Auroop Ganguly, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern University who was unaffiliated with the study. Ganguly believes that researchers should address what “causes these opinions to change,” and the impacts of opinions across diverse groups. The University project “is a good way to understand what is happening,” he added. “It’s fine to have opinions, as long as we understand where it is coming from and why.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the future, the group hopes to continue work on the project and expand their data set to include more tweets. By doing so, they would be able to look at specific moments in time pertinent to climate policy, such as the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 or President Trump’s announcement that he would withdraw from the agreement in 2017.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are also looking for a more detailed explanation of how bots influence the discourse on climate change and contribute to an already polarized network. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We know they’re working” Marlow said, describing bots on Twitter. “Are they just retweeting? Are they generating content? Are they actually tweeting at people? We just don’t know what they’re doing.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Jezero Crater selected as Mars 2020 mission landing site</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following the announcement of the program nearly six years ago, the Mars 2020 rover mission has selected the Jezero Crater as its landing site. The crater is a location analyzed and recommended by multiple researchers from the Brown scientific community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Jezero Crater is a now-dry open basin lake that once included a delta, much like the Mississippi Delta. This is particularly ideal for sampling since the water deposits organic material toward the bottom of the lake, said Jim Head, professor of geological sciences. The crater also sits at the intersection of three geographical points on the surface of Mars, making it particularly well-suited for exploration. The crater borders a basin, lies on a volcanic plain and is intersected by a number of fractures, said Jack Mustard, professor of earth, environmental and planetary sciences and professor of environment and society. “The Jezero Crater is an outstanding place to look at (the) confluence of geology and mineralogy to test if life ever existed,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The presence of two minerals in the crater — carbonate and olivine — points toward the prior existence of organic processes and the possibility of past life, albeit primitive life, Mustard said. Olivine is a green mineral that, when weathered or steeped in water, produces hydrogen to form methane, two key products for food of microbes. Carbonate is a mineral that is a known by-product of olivine consumption. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jezero was chosen through an extensive site selection process<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that included around 30 proposed locations. “It’s like a county fair bake off,” Head said. During these workshops, researchers presented the reasons why their site, and the ensuing exploration, would be promising. “It’s a very passionate process. … You take a personal interest in the sites you are looking at,” Mustard said. As workshops went on, the sites were ranked; researchers then looked into those that received high scores. Ultimately, a final workshop decided on the Jezero Crater as the landing site for the rover. “It was a really nice convergence of research, missions and community interests in solving these fundamental scientific problems,” Head said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once launched, the rover will be equipped with similar tools to those of the Curiosity rover, which is currently exploring the Gale Crater on Mars. It will be able to analyze composition, detect organics and analyze trace gases, and will be equipped with a ground-penetrating radar to see subsurface structure, Head said. Though there are many possibilities that researchers can anticipate, they still believe there will be developments and findings that will surprise them. “Simply put, science is the exploration of the unknown. … Almost always, the big payoff is in the things we don’t anticipate,” Head said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The launch is scheduled for July 2020, according to a NASA press release. But a considerable amount of work remains to be completed, Mustard said. Researchers hope to better characterize the landing site, develop an exploration strategy and enhance the engineering of certain tools — especially sampling tools — before the launch, Head and Mustard said.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re all interested in, ‘Did life ever exist elsewhere in the universe’ and the first place to look might be Mars,” Mustard said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Researchers design new brain implant</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Researchers have shown that an experimental brain implant allows individuals with paralysis to control a cursor on a tablet computer. The study marks another step toward the group’s ultimate goal of restoring forms of communication to individuals with neurological impairments, said Krishna Shenoy, professor of engineering at Stanford University and a senior author of the paper.</p>
<p class="p2">The study comes from a team of researchers working as part of BrainGate, which has labs at Stanford, Brown and Case Western Reserve University that are focused on designing brain-computer interfaces to aid patients with neurological deficits.</p>
<p class="p2">The study, published in November, is the first to show that patients can use a brain-computer interface machine to control a cursor and “click” on an unmodified tablet, according to Jaimie Henderson, a neurosurgeon at Stanford and one of the study’s senior authors. This is the first time the technology is being tested on a standard tablet without any special software or design, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Participants in the study navigated tablet apps, such as an email program, a weather app, a web browser and a chat interface, said Leigh Hochberg ’90, professor of engineering and a senior author of the study. The tasks required users to navigate a cursor across the tablet screen and initiate clicks by thinking about moving their own hand, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">The BrainGate implant is responsible for sensing an individual’s brain signals and sending that information to a series of processors that translate the signals into cursor navigation and “clicking,” Hochberg said.</p>
<p class="p2">The whole system consists of a device that is implanted in the region of the brain responsible for movement and a set of processors that use mathematical methods to read the brain signals, Shenoy said. “At the heart of the technology is the so-called ‘decoder,’ …<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and this is a mathematical algorithm that is able to translate electrical impulses from many different neurons into a continuous movement signal for a computer cursor,” he explained.</p>
<p class="p2">Since this is the first time this type of technology has been applied to an unmodified tablet, the study acts as a “proof of concept” that the BrainGate system can be used functionally on unaltered hardware, Henderson said.</p>
<p class="p2">“We can actually start to see how these systems could be used in the real world by individuals with paralysis,” said Vikash Gilja, a researcher at the University of California at San Diego who was not affiliated with this study but has previously worked with BrainGate. This study shows how brain-computer interface technology can function successfully on a more generalized level, since the participants completed more practical and commonplace computer tasks, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">With an eye to the future, the team looks to improve the system and continue progressing toward better functionality and technology. “Right now, it’s possible to use these systems, but they don’t move as quickly or as accurately as you might want them to,” Shenoy said.</p>
<p class="p2">According to Henderson, advancements in neuroscience and improvements in the machine itself lie ahead.“The human brain is a big place with a lot of complexity, and we’re only scratching the surface of that complexity and how it can be leveraged to improve our ability to use assistive devices,” Henderson added.</p>
<p class="p2">On a similar note, Hochberg stressed the need for future improvement in calibration, external hardware and personnel.</p>
<p class="p2">After 14 years of development, the BrainGate system has functioned with unmodified tablets, but there is more work to be done before the technology becomes widely available. The group hopes that one day the system will be able to restore communication to people with neurological damage, citing this new study as one step toward that goal.</p>
<p class="p2">“The participants in our trial … deserve enormous credit. They enroll in the trial not because they’re hoping to gain any personal benefit, but because they’re hoping to help us to develop and test this technology we … hope will help people with paralysis in the future,” Hochberg said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Whitehouse, Cicilline meet with climate lab</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Monday morning in a small room on the second floor of the Urban Environmental Lab, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI and Congressman David Cicilline, D-RI, met with members of the Climate Development Lab. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The group discussed the students’ report revealing that the same dozen groups facilitated the climate change countermovement for many years. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This meeting was planned after students from ENVS 1574: “Engaged Climate Policy in the U.S.: Rhode Island and Washington, D.C.” met with Whitehouse last week in Washington and presented to the Senate Climate Action Task Force. Whitehouse expressed further interest following his meeting with the class. Monday’s meeting was an effort by Whitehouse to elevate the importance of the work done by the CDL, said Professor of Environmental Studies and Director of the CDL J. Timmons Roberts, who teaches the course. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Caroline Jones ’19, the teaching assistant for Roberts’ course, and a group of four students wrote the 37-page report that they presented at both meetings. The report, which was edited by others in Roberts’ class, features roughly two or three pages each on 12 different climate denial coalitions. The report also includes a timeline of each coalition’s activities and a chart explaining how each group is related, Jones said. The report will be disseminated through various media outlets soon, Jones said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At Monday’s meeting, Jones explained the driving groups behind the U.S. withdrawal from the 1992 Kyoto Protocol also influenced President Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in 2016, she said. The countermovement “can’t find anyone new to make their arguments for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These 12 coalitions strategize to make it seem like there are many voices on the anti-climate change action side, while in reality “nearly all of them are funded by the oil, gas and coal industries,” Roberts said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Visiting Professor Robert Brulle, a member of the CDL who was present at the meeting, also said that fossil fuel companies know that pollution has adverse implications for the climate. They have all the best science available to them, he said, “yet at the same time, they are putting out all of this other propaganda.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Roberts, Brulle and Jones hope to reveal the forces behind the climate change denial movement with their research. Whitehouse specifically referenced Brulle’s work, which collects data on who has testified about climate change in Congress over the past 50 years and involves an ongoing analysis of the types of people and groups involved, Brulle told the legislators. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Roberts is hopeful that his class’ meeting with Whitehouse was “the start of expanding his understanding of what we do and how it might be useful in the fight to create adequate climate policy in the United States and open opportunities for Brown students to be a part of that.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’ve had a developing relationship with Senator Whitehouse based on his … truly profound interest and concern and dedication to fighting climate change and fighting denial of climate change,” Roberts said, adding that Cicilline’s presence at the meeting was also important. Cicilline is in a “unique position” to be influential and make change given his party’s recent victories in the U.S. House of Representatives, he explained. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whitehouse emphasized the importance of reaching across the aisle to pursue climate change initiatives. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“The reason that I’m here and that I love what Brown is doing here is that in my experience, fighting this battle at the very front in Congress, I see that this is actually not a partisan issue,” Whitehouse said. “I have too many conversations with Republican colleagues who understand that this is real, and want to get ahead of it, to believe that it’s a partisan issue,” he continued. According to Whitehouse, climate change has become a partisan issue by a “very well-developed piece of political and public relations machinery” that has effectively taken over the Republican party. “The biggest gap that we have on a pathway to success on climate is our failure to have shown the public who is behind the curtain on so much of the nonsense that gets propagated as climate denial,” he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After the meeting, Jones reflected on her experiences with the CDL. “Timmons treats his undergraduate students like they are graduate students, which is an incredible opportunity to do research and to collaborate,” Jones said. She added that the class and her work at the CDL have allowed her to build a network that has helped her get summer internships. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Roberts has worked to get undergraduate students involved with climate policy since 2010. In previous semesters when the class and the CDL focused their research on helping developing countries understand climate change, he brought undergraduates to United Nations negotiations around the world. Last year, while with his class in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/11/29/climate-development-lab-attends-cop23-germany/">Bonn, Germany</a>, Roberts realized that his efforts were needed in Washington rather than abroad in the current political climate. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“All the students at Brown, they don’t want to wait until they graduate to start to change the world and make it better. … Brown students want to save the world now,” Roberts said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">At a time when cybersecurity, machine learning and artificial intelligence deeply influence the economy and public debate, more students are flocking to the University’s Department of Computer Science. After half a decade of steady increases in enrollment, the department is taking new steps to respond to student interest. The CS department will hire 15 new faculty members in the next five years, a 50 percent expansion that constitutes the largest single wave of faculty hiring in its 40-year history, said Ugur Cetintemel, professor of computer science and chair of the department. In hopes of increasing the diversity and scope of research and teaching in the department, 10 of the new hires will be tenure-track professors, and the other five will be lecturers, he added.</p>
<p class="p4">The number of CS concentrators has <span class="s3">more than tripled in the last six years, and while faculty hiring has been continuous, it has not kept up with growth in the number of interested students. When Cetintemel began working at the University in 2001, “a class size of 30 to 40 would be considered pretty decent.” Now, classes with 200 students are not unusual, with some reaching 300 or more in enrollment. Some of these courses are introductory level lectures, where high enrollment is typical, but Cetintemel said that this trend appears across all course levels. “There’s a lot of catch-up work to be done,” he said. “<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/14/draft-wang-cs-most-popular-concentration/">One in six students</a> at Brown is concentra</span>ting in computer science at this point.”</p>
[infogram id="e857e30d-42e6-4161-b183-3555ab988a5e" prefix="v7M" format="interactive" title="Line Chart"]
<p class="p4">Kathi Fisler, a professor in the department, elaborated on some of the challenges posed by larger classes. For one, it can be harder to get students to come in and ask for help, she said. “They assume you don’t have the time for them,” even when this isn’t the case. Class size can also impose a communication burden. “Where you notice it is in the volume of email you have to handle,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">The expansion is also meant to make advising responsibilities more manageable for faculty. Cetintemel noted that the average faculty member in the department is responsible for about 30 advisees.</p>
<p class="p4">The department’s growth responds to the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of computer science as well as the rise of newly emerging research fields. Tom Doeppner, a professor and vice chair who has been in the department since its inception, said there are not only “larger courses than we used to have, there’s more things we’d like to teach.”</p>
<p class="p4">Cetintemel cited cybersecurity, robotics and human-computer interaction as areas which have transformed from niche fields to mainstream domains of the discipline in recent years. “One goal for this growth is to strengthen ourselves in such areas,” he said.</p>
<p class="p4">Michael Littman, a professor and associate department chair of computer science, wrote in an email to The Herald that he has worked to accommodate great student interest in his research area, machine learning. However, he noted that “doing so has absorbed all my available time for research and keeping up with the rapidly evolving literature.” He added that the new hires should help keep the department “fresh and nimble in terms of staying on top of the latest work and its implications.”</p>
<p class="p4">The multidisciplinary potential of the department received special attention in the planning for the expansion. Other departments within the University often look to computer science for crossover and collaborative projects, Cetintemel said. As it currently stands, “We can accommodate only a fraction of those (requests),” he added. In hopes of encouraging more interdisciplinary research and teaching, three of the tenure-track faculty members will have considerable crossover with other departments.</p>
<p class="p4">The expansion will also allow the department to put more emphasis on custom courses for non-concentrators. Fisler described plans for a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/17/computer-science-offer-new-intro-track/">three-course track</a> for students who are interested in computer science but not necessarily planning to concentrate in it, adding that many students are interested in “small doses” of CS education relevant to their own discipline. “I would like us … to be a department where people can see the breadth of intellectual activities that touch on computing reflected in the department,” she said.</p>
<p class="p4">But hiring new professors is unlikely to be the only change coming to the department, Cetintemel said. “If you have 50 percent new faculty, you need more space and more staff to support these facu<span class="s4">lty members,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">If the department continues to expand, the</span><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/27/cit-create-labs-public-space/"> oft-renovated Center for Information Technology</a> will not be able to serve its needs for much longer, Doeppner pointed out. “We are running out of space,” he said, adding that units like computational biology are moving out, which can be detrimental to interdisciplinary work. “It’s always been really important to us to have everybod</span><span class="s4">y close to</span> one another.”</p>
<p class="p4">The CS department is ready to accept a larger place in the future of the University. “We are trying to align ourselves so that we are building research programs that can … make a positive social impact,” Cetintemel said.</p>
<p class="p4">Fisler said that although CS has seen previous surges in enrollment that have then declined, this recent growth is different and merits the investment in new faculty. She described predictions made in the early 2000s, when some saw that computing was becoming “intellectual infrastructure” for other disciplines. While this wasn’t true during those years, “Now it’s getting there,” she said. “What the demand for research and education in computing looks like may shift,” she said, “but the volume will probably be there for a long time to come.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">On Wednesday evening, three University researchers gathered in the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society to discuss their ongoing multidisciplinary research on “Deco</span>ding the Human Brain with Data.” As the next installment of the “Building on Distinction” lecture series, the conversation focused primarily on the intersection of neuroscience and data science. The panel featured Matthew Harrison, associate professor of applied mathematics; Stephanie Jones, associate professor of neuroscience; and Dima Amso, associate professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Harrison began the event by introducing BrainGate, a joint research program between Brown, Stanford and Case Western University that aims to help those with motor control issues and paralysis. BrainGate places a sensor on patients’ brains to track and record signals while patients attempt to complete tasks such as clicking. As patients perform these actions, their intended movements are paired with the resulting brain signals to create a database of pairs, Harrison said. As the database grows, BrainGate is able to develop a more complete understanding of brain signals and movement.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Delving into a more data-oriented research program, Jones spoke on her work with Human Neocortical Neurosolver, a software that aids clinicians and researchers in testing hypotheses by simulating large-scale neuronal responses. By using data collected from EEG experiments, researchers can compare simulated neural signals to uncover the cellular origins of their data, Jones said. The software can be used to study healthy brain signals and non-invasive brain stimulation, among other applications, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The final presentation of the evening focused on the use of artificial intelligence to better quantify and understand human development. “I study the most rapidly changing machine in the universe, which is the human infant-to-childhood transition,” Amso said. Development during the first three years of life “is incredibly elegant, and it’s very systematic,” she added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As part of her research, Amso created The Smart Playroom, a space fitted with a number of motion-tracking cameras and filled with toys and objects typically found in a child’s playroom. The researchers track how children interact with objects in the room, paying special attention to how the children move their eyes. This technology allows for a comprehensive analysis of early childhood development to study memory, perception and motor skills at a young age, she said. By studying and analyzing the data encoded from this Smart Playroom, researchers can discover patterns of normal or abnormal development, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In response to an audience member’s question, Amso explained that her work is driven by both discovery and hypotheses. The discovery approach requires researchers to record comprehensive data throughout development, whereas the hypothesis approach focuses on specific age groups and answers specific questions.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Audience members were also curious about how researchers used machine learning in their work. In Harrison’s work with BrainGate, he specified that data collection is supervised by researchers directly. But as computers calibrate the data, the programs and equations create better predictions that grow the aforementioned database. Amso explained that the researchers identify and encode the specific behaviors so they can create novel data sets and track data.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cornelia Dean, moderator of the discussion and visiting professor of the practice of science, technology and society, said each project combined disciplines to yield great results. “These projects embody the potentially enormous advantages we can derive from true interdisciplinary research,” she said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Study finds stress responses in mice vary between sexes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A study published last week identified a new possible explanation for the difference in neurological responses to early life stress between men and women.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study, conducted on mice, showed that females exposed to early life stress saw a decline in cognitive ability when performing certain tasks and had lower cell density in the orbitofrontal cortex, the brain region responsible for decision-making. The male mice in the study, however, were not affected, despite being exposed to the same stress. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though the study used mice, there is strong evidence to suggest that the findings can be applied to humans, said Kevin Bath, assistant professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences. “Women are two times as likely to develop depression or (post-traumatic stress disorder) from stressful or traumatic events in childhood. We’ve known this for a long time, but this is the first time we can show the mechanism behind differences between how men and women might respond to stress differently,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The study was conducted with two groups. In the control group, mice pups were raised under normal conditions, with the mother taking care of their young from birth. In the early life stress group, the pups and their mothers were given an area with limited nesting materials for one week four days after birth, “equivalent to one year of being in a high-stress environment,” Bath said. Afterwards, the mice in both groups were tested on their cognitive abilities using a variety of rule-learning tests.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Researchers found that females exposed to early life stress were more likely than males to be impaired in rule-reversal learning. In this task, mice were conditioned to associate food with a particular scent, such as lavender, and would then have to associate it with a different scent, like lemon, said Haley Goodwill PhD'18, lead author of the study. Additionally, “this was compounded by the loss of parvalbumin interneuron cells,” a type of neuron in the orbitofrontal cortex that is important for cognition and flexibility, and sensitive to stress, she said. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the second part of the study, researchers used optogenetics, a technique that uses light to manipulate cells, to turn off parvalbumin interneuron cells in the healthy mice, which caused them to have the same impairment as the early life stress female mice. “That indicated to us it could be these fine-tuning neurons that affect this (response to) stress,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">“This is a very new model of stress, … (but) the results of depression (for mice) map very well onto the human literature,” said Gabriela Manzano Nieves GS, another researcher involved in the study. Though the particular model of early life stress in mice used in the study has only been in scientific literature for “about 10 years or less,” this new study leads researchers in a promising direction, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The researchers said that future studies should investigate the mechanisms behind the sex differences in parvalbumin cell density that might be causing the female mice to be more susceptible to stress. There are many potential explanations for these differences in early-life development, such as chromosomal sex difference, sex hormone differences or higher maternal nurturing of males compared to females after stress, Bath said.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Francis Lee, chair of the department of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College, who is unaffiliated with the study, believes the research is a promising step toward advancing our understanding of the brain. “It’s conceptually novel. People don’t normally think of the orbitofrontal cortex when thinking about depression in the brain,” Lee said. “This finding could have great potential in informing neuroimaging studies with regards to depression.”</span></p>
<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that stress responses in mice were found to vary between genders. In fact, stress responses in mice were found to vary between sexes. An earlier version of this article also identified Haley Goodwill as a graduate student. In fact, Goodwill received her PhD in 2018. The Herald regrets the errors. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In an attempt to understand what makes some patients with obesity respond better to surgery than others, Professor and Chair of Epidemiology Alison Field and her team analyzed over 10,000 patients who received weight-loss surgery. They found that patients that binge ate were able to lose weight more easily than those whose obesity was likely more rooted in genetics. According to Field, “We let the data tell us the story. We put in body weight, history of body weight, eating behaviors, hormone levels, factors related to cardiometabolic health, and asked how do these naturally cluster together?”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Field’s final model outlined four distinct subgroups that each responded differently to the surgery. Field’s team studied patients for three years following bariatric surgery, which is commonly known as weight-loss surgery. Previous studies have shown that losing weight improves eating habits, creating a positive feedback loop. This factor could possibly explain the sustained weight loss among binge eaters, Field said, since they may have changed their eating behavior. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">According to Leonidas Bleris, associate professor of bioengineering at the University of Texas at Dallas who was unaffiliated with the study, obesity “is a complex problem. It has to do with a lot more than just genetics.” Bleris explained that other factors as wide-ranging as the diet of your parents to medical history affect how you process food. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Field’s group accounted for a much larger variety of factors than most other obesity classification studies, according to Jim Mitchell, a research scientist at the Neuropsychiatric Research Institute and a co-author of the paper. The dataset covered a wide range of factors, including psychological behavior, medical records and eating habits, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">What really makes this study unique is the size of the dataset that Field was using, Mitchell said. “It’s very unusual to have a sample of patients this large with this much follow-up data.” </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the findings preliminarily suggest that treatments be personalized for different subgroups, further studies need to replicate the results before any doctors start treating patients differently, Mitchell said. The study identified subgroups that lost weight differently, but researchers have yet to determine the role that genetics play in controlling these differences, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Field hopes that other researchers are inspired by her work and attempt to recreate her findings, eventually leading to clinical applications.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">She also aims to examine obesity in teenagers using a similar data set collected by Mitchell that focuses on younger patients. “There are fewer ways you can develop extreme obesity when you’re younger. … There’s probably a stronger genetic component, so we want to see (if)we see the same subgroups when they’re younger,” she said. She hopes to use this information to develop targeted treatments for young adults. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the group found varied results among different types of patients, “overall bariatric surgery is by far the best treatment we have for severe obesity. It’s the only treatment we have that’s likely to result in sustained weight loss and marked improvement. It works for just about everybody. It just worked a little bit better for some people,” Mitchell said. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Since Dec. 22, the University and other research institutions have scrambled to adapt to the unprecedented political stalemate over the federal government shutdown, which has dried up funds for federally supported research projects and now threatens long-term scientific advancement across the nation.</p>
<p class="p2">When the government shut down before the holidays, major agencies like the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration all closed without approved appropriations for 2019. Research institutions <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-shutdown-shows-just-how-vital-government-scientists-are/">rely on these agencies</a> not only for funding but also for technological, data-based and research support.</p>
<p class="p2">“The federal shutdown is causing uncertainty and complications about research funding at Brown … In some cases the shutdown is slowing or halting research itself,” Vice President for Research Jill Pipher wrote in a statement to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite an inability to get funds from federal agencies, “the University is making scheduled payments on existing active NSF and NASA grants,” Pipher wrote, adding that these grants provide the salaries for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. “Brown, like other universities, is experiencing the strain of having to advance these funds without reimbursement.”</p>
<p class="p2">“We’ve been in a state of pretty perpetual anxiety since the shutdown started,” said postdoctoral researcher Christopher Horvat, who works as a polar oceanographer at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, where he studies sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans in relation to climate change. Horvat is not only a post-doc at the University but also a government contractor — he holds a second postdoctoral fellowship with the NOAA Climate and Global Change Program. Though Horvat’s paycheck has not yet been cut, his financial situation could change if the shutdown continues for more than a few more weeks, he said.</p>
<p class="p2">Many research<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>endeavours, especially in relation to the work of government contractors, have been put on hold. Conference travel cannot be completed during the shutdown since it is a “large capital investment that takes time to plan” and cannot be scheduled when future sources of funding are uncertain, Hovart said. Meeting with other experts is crucial for scientists who use these trips to forge collaborations with their peers and discuss new findings from institutions scattered across the globe.</p>
<p class="p2">“Some researchers are having to pay for travel on their own, hoping for later reimbursement, and some have had to cancel trips because they couldn’t afford to pay the expenses on their own. In addition, federal program officers are unable to attend scientific meetings and conferences that inform their work,” Pipher wrote.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In order to serve on grant review panels for the NSF, many University researchers must travel to the locations where the panels are held. All scheduled panels have been “canceled and will likely be rescheduled to a later date,” <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/shutdown/panelists.jsp">according to the NSF</a>. As the schedule continues to be delayed, the pace of scientific research at the University and across the nation could slow. “This will cause problems for many months after the shutdown ends,” Pipher wrote. If panels cannot convene, then grants previously submitted to the NSF cannot be reviewed and researchers who otherwise would have been funded will see a delay in their project timelines. In addition, no new grants will be reviewed or approved during the shutdown. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Professor Emeritus of Geological Sciences Peter Schultz, who directs the Northeast Planetary Data Center and previously worked at NASA, expressed concerns about back pay for contractors working at NASA and other agencies. Though President Trump has signed an act guaranteeing back pay for most federal employees affected by the shutdown, this legislation does not usually apply to government contractors. As the shutdown continues, this could equate to the loss of a significant percentage of their yearly salary, Schultz said. The “human toll” is detrimental, and “NASA may lose some really good people” as a result, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Beyond the immediate impact, the University and other research institutions may feel a number of long-term ripple effects.</p>
<p class="p2">Time-sensitive work can be compromised by a lack of resources during a shutdown, Horvat said, especially as this shutdown continues to stretch into the longest in American history. For example,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>reports for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which involves groups working for years to develop accurate predictive climate models, could theoretically be permanently handicapped by the pause in data collection. “Those labs in America may have their computers shut down. If they are not able to do that simulation, they won’t be included in the next climate report,” Horvat said. Without funding, valuable data can be lost and years of work compromised.</p>
<p class="p2">At NASA, “missions are still going to operate,” Schultz said, but data analysis from ongoing missions or preparations for upcoming projects may be postponed. Committees populated by contractors or civil servants who are not able to work during the shutdown will be behind schedule when they return to work, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Beyond the impact on individual projects, the lack of job security made apparent by the shutdown may impact young researchers. “From my perspective, it has much (broader) effects than just us missing a paycheck — which is bad enough — it enhances a pull away from public-benefit science,” Horvat said. Especially for early career scientists, work in the private sector may become more appealing as the shutdown and its politics fuel anxiety, he added. <span class="s1">“Those of us who do climate science are interested in doing science for public good,” he said, adding that “there’s a reason why we are in these fields. We are trying to understand how to better forecast extreme events and the effects of the changing climate.” However, he added, if federal support is not available for this research, it cannot be done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s not explicit that anyone is trying to discourage us from doing climate science, but it certainly has that effect.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Brown is monitoring the situation closely and will continue to report any potential implications to the University community,” Pipher wrote in her statement. It has yet to be determined when the shutdown will end, but for these scientists, like many federal employees, the effects are already being felt.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Joint study on cfDNA provides insight into aging</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">Many say age is just a number, but a recent research study involving short pieces of cell-free DNA has added some scientific truth to this common cliché.</p>
<p class="p3">University researchers, in tandem with researchers in Bologna, Italy and Belo Horizonte, Brazil, published a study in December proposing a link between cfDNA, which circulates in the blood outside of cells, and biological age, the age of humans’s bodies, which can differ from their chronological age, said Assistant Professor of Biology and co-author of the study Nicola Neretti. The study suggests that hundred-year-old, healthy individuals show similarities in their genetic structure to those about 75 years younger,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he added. If further developed, these findings could help scientists better understand the health implications of aging and possibly determine the efficacy of related drugs.</p>
<p class="p4">Through sequencing, the researchers examined the nucleotides — the coding components of DNA — comprising the cfDNA taken from the blood of 12 individuals divided into four age groups: approximately 25-year-old “young” individuals, 70-year-old “old” individuals, “healthy” centenarians and “unhealthy,” bedridden centenarians who failed a mental score exam, said Yee Voan Teo GS, the first author of the study. All the subjects were residents of Bologna, according to Neretti.</p>
<p class="p4">As people age, the spacing between their nucleosomes becomes less optimal, Teo said. Nucleosomes are components of chromatin, a substance which consists of DNA wrapped around proteins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After analysis of the cfDNA, the results of the experiment indicated that a healthy centenarian’s nucleosome profile most closely resembled the profiles of the young age group, while the unhealthy centenarians and old age group had nucleosome arrangements that were consistent with a greater biological age, she added.</p>
<p class="p4">The distinction between more “open” euchromatin, which includes the DNA of genes that are transcribed and expressed, and more “compact” heterochromatin, which is denser and contains DNA that does not code for proteins, decreases with age, Neretti said. He added that such changes define the epigenome, which includes all chemical DNA modifiers of a person. “Most, if not all, the old individuals studied did not have an epigenome that was as young as the (healthy) centenarians’,” Neretti said. Healthy “centenarians tend to have a level of distribution of compactness versus openness that is more similar to the young individuals than the old individuals,” he added. These “centenarians appear to have a healthier epigenome,” Neretti said.</p>
<p class="p4">To arrive at these results, the teams in Bologna, Belo Horizonte and at the University had to apply their respective knowledge in longevity, immunology and computational biology and epigenomics, Neretti said. Those from Bologna, led by Professor Claudio Franceschi at the University of Bologna, and those from Brazil helped obtain the cfDNA. Afterwards, researchers at the University undertook the analysis of the data, Neretti said. Neretti’s team was tasked with identifying the age-related alterations in various regions of the <a href="https://www.u-bordeaux.com/About-us/Honoris-Causa/Honoris-Causa-since-2014/Claudio-Franceschi-University-of-Bologna" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genome</a>, he said.</p>
<p class="p4">The small size of cfDNA makes it especially suitable for analysis, Neretti explained, and facilitates visualization of a nucleosome’s location.</p>
<p class="p4">Teo believes that observing the correlation between biological age and the cfDNA results in samples taken from people rather than from cells grown in culture is an “important step forward in understanding how (this process) actually happens in humans.”</p>
<p class="p4">Better identifying the cells that the cfDNA came from is a possible future step, Neretti said. To accomplish this goal, the researchers hope to improve the procedure for studying cfDNA from non-cancerous tissues, which release less cfDNA than cancer tissues, Teo said. In the past, most studies on cfDNA have focused on cancer research, Teo added.</p>
<p class="p4">Another future goal for the project includes expanding the number of study subjects, Teo said. Teo hopes later experiments will examine gradual changes in cfDNA through more age groups.</p>
<p class="p4">“We also want to get individuals from real different backgrounds, not just from that region of Italy. We would have to expand to other regions,” Neretti said.</p>
<p class="p4">Looking ahead, the study may contribute to multiple advances within science and medicine, especially if cfDNA can serve as a biomarker, the authors of the study said. The data “provides a glimpse into how (cfDNA) can be used to predict the health status” and “potentially predict the biological age” of an individual, Teo said.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Similarly, Assistant Professor at the University of Bologna Miriam Capri, another co-author, wrote that the “results pave the way to identify predictors of unhealthy conditions and mortality.” </span></p>
<p class="p4">The experiment also indicates that cfDNA could be analyzed to test a drug’s or process’s effectiveness in slowing down aging, Neretti said. “Potentially, if we could fine tune the predictive power in terms of cell-free DNA versus biological age, then we could use this cell-free DNA biomarker to help in those studies,” he added.</p>
<p class="p4">Treatments for illnesses afflicting the elderly could be developed with additional studies on the connection between age and chromatin structure, Teo said.</p>
<p class="p4">Professor Peter Adams, who works at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute and was not involved in the study, was interested by “the suggestion that by looking at this DNA … there are potentially molecular markers on that DNA which can predict healthy versus unhealthy aging.” He has undertaken research on changes in DNA and biomarkers that could help reveal more about the health effects that await an aging individual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He added that analyzing data from more individuals is necessary to substantiate what was found. These predictions could help “treat diseases earlier and maybe prevent diseases, which is good for the individuals, but it’s also good in terms of probably allocating health care resources,” Adams said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jerome Sanes, professor of neuroscience and director of the University’s MRI Research Facility, and David Berson ’75, professor of ophthalmology and chair of the department of neuroscience, were the lead authors on a study responsible for identifying a connection between light-sensitive cells in the eye and regions in the brain that affect mood.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sanes and Berson’s search for this particular circuit in human brains was inspired by recent work done at the National Institute of Mental Health, which found a very similar circuit in mouse brains. “The mice were subjected to 3.5 hours of light and 3.5 hours of dark,” said Sanes. This light pattern caused a behavior in mice analogous to human depression; when the researchers eliminated the light-sensitive eye cells involved in the hypothesized brain circuit, the depression-like symptoms went away. “That suggested that this brain pathway might have an importance for depression,” Sanes added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sanes and Berson sought to answer the question: “Is there a region (of the human brain) also activated by the same light stimulus that activates the pathway in mice?” Berson explained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although light-related depression in humans is a well-known phenomenon, not much is known about the specific mechanisms in the brain underlying the relationship between light and mood, Berson added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To try to answer this question, Sanes and Berson utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging, which allows scientists to measure brain activity in different regions. The team wondered how changing light intensity would affect brain activity in a specific region, and they measured this activity using an fMRI, Berson said. These experiments revealed human brain activity in a highly complex region very similar to the region found in mice. “We don’t know if it’s exactly the same area as in the mouse or if it’s the same circuit,” but it supports the idea that the circuit could be present in all mammals, he added.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Some of the brain areas which had the light-related sensitivity have been implicated in depression and (SAD),” Sanes said. Understanding the brain circuit involved in mood disorders like SAD is important for developing treatments for these conditions, said Samer Hattar, one of the lead authors on the mouse study and chief of the section on light and circadian rhythms at the NIMH. “This (research) is exciting because for the last six years, there haven’t been any good drugs or treatments for treating depression,” he added. Now, knowledge of the existence of this circuit will allow researchers to attempt manipulating its function to create beneficial mood disorder treatment, he added. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to the possible link to SAD, this light-sensitive circuit could have implications in decision-making, Sanes and Berson mentioned. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Their research on this human brain circuit will be submitted for publication in about a month and a half, after which it will undergo review for about six months, said Sanes, adding that they hope this publication will lead to further research on mood disorders. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A team of University researchers received funding from the National Science Foundation in August 2017 to develop bioluminescent tools that can be used to enhance methods of studying the brain; researchers atCentral Michigan University and the University of California, San Diego also received the funding.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The group studies tools in bioluminescence and optogenetics,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the process of altering non-light sensitive cells so that they become light sensitive. They also share the techniques with other scientists and develop ways to engage with students of all levels, said Justine Allen PhD ’14, the group’s program manager. Allen summarized the group’s core goals as “innovation, dissemination and education.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The group, called The Bioluminescence Hub, is a part of the National Science Foundation’s effort to invest in researchers that innovate new ways to learn about the brain and share those tools with other scientists, according to Christopher Moore, professor of neuroscience and associate director of the Carney Institute for Brain Science. Moore is the principal investigator of the Bioluminescence Hub and leads one of the group’s four labs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Along with Moore, the other co-principal investigators include Diane Lipscombe, professor of neuroscience and director of the Carney Institute for Brain Science, Ute Hochgeschwender, professor of neuroscience at the College of Medicine at Central Michigan University and Nathan Shaner, principle investigator at the Scintillon Institute. Each researcher leads a lab that focuses on different topics within research on bioluminescence and optogenetics, as they relate to neuroscience. “The four labs in our NeuroNex are working on advancing methods based on bioluminescent tools, and also working hard to openly and very freely disseminate this knowledge at a lot of different levels,” Moore said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Each lab specializes in a different part of the group’s goals, with Shaner’s lab at the Scintillon Institute working to find, develop and improve fluorescent compounds. “Out of the whole team, we are the most basic science … so one thing we do is we go out into the field, for example to the great barrier reef … and collect samples of fluorescent and luminescent animals,” Shaner said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Hochgeschwender’s lab takes these compounds and uses molecular biology techniques to tie the bioluminescent molecules to light sensitive proteins and implant the products into the neurons. Her lab, and NeuroNex as a whole, work to encode, in simplistic terms, both a light emitter and light sensor in neurons, opening a whole new variety of applications and tools for scientists, she said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These modified neurons, with the bioluminescent and optogenetic alternation, are studied in Lipscombe’s lab, where she and other researchers are looking at ways to use light emission as an indication of neuronal activity. “We’re trying to make these molecules bioluminesce when there’s a calcium signal, so we can use these molecules as a proxy for activity,” Lipscombe said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moore’s lab takes these same tools to study more complex networks of neurons in the brain. To test theories about how the brain works, researchers often need to record from many neurons — Moore proposed 1,000 neurons as a possible sample size — which can be done in several labs around the world. These labs utilize neurons, modified with these bioluminescent constructs, which flicker each time they fire, allowing researchers to observe activity by counting the series of flashes. “Bioluminescence is a really powerful way of chemically generating light and controlling or watching cells,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“(This research) allows us to tease out information from the brain in ways not currently possible,” said Hochgeschwender. Shaner also referenced the ways in which bioluminescence can be used to perform live cell microscopy at very high resolution, a challenge researchers face today. On this same point, Lipscombe mentioned how bioluminescence can provide better tools for observing neural activity, something neuroscience researchers continually need. “Being able to see where the brain is active is a huge goal,” Moore said. He added that the combination of bioluminescence and optogenetics could “allow cells to optically communicate where they used to chemically communicate … (and) rewire the brain with light.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beyond the research and innovation goals of the group, the Bioluminescence Hub also works to share its technology with other researchers and with students of all education levels, Moore said. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“We’re hoping to educate students and the public at all levels. We have a plan for grade school students, high school students and undergraduates,” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">“We will use principles of open science to share our tools and knowledge with all interested scientists through our website content, emissary program and workshops. These interactions allow other labs to use our tools to pursue their own research questions and serve as teaching and training opportunities for our graduate students and postdocs,” Allen added in an email to The Herald.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At his lab in California during the summer of 2018, Shaner and his colleagues hosted three undergraduate students and two high school students — one sponsored by NeuroNex — who pursued independent research projects within bioluminescence and molecular biology. The Brown-based labs also offer Undergraduate Research and Teaching Awards for University students, in addition to a program called the Marine Biological Laboratory Undergraduate Practicum. “The (MBL Practicum) is an opportunity for undergraduates, usually juniors and seniors, from all across the United States to come to Woods Hole, MA for a week-long immersive experience (to learn about bioluminescence),” Allen said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The researchers, with the help of a few high school students this past summer, have also developed a “bioluminescence kit” for high school teachers, which they hope will help teachers present the topic in high school science classes. “We hope to give a zero- or low-cost kit to teachers and a lot of materials to make it easy to teach a hands-on lesson on bioluminescence,” Moore said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I think the fun thing about having a collaborative project like this is that … each individual project on its own is great, but they are so much greater when they are combined,” Lipscombe said.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">University researchers recently published a study analyzing the material properties of alginate graphene oxide, which could lead to new developments in both cancer research and 3D printing technology for human organ printing.</p>
<p class="p2">The team aims to simulate the environment in which tumors grow and use that simulation to predict the response of human cells to tumor growth.“There’s (an) ongoing hypothesis that if you make (a cell) matrix that’s disregulated and stiffer … (it may) also support more aggressive tumor cells,” said Ian Wong, assistant professor of molecular pharmacology, physiology, biotechnology and engineering, who oversaw the study.</p>
<p class="p2">The adjustable stiffness of alginate GO allows researchers to examine how changes in stiffness affect cell behavior, he added. In addition, the discovery of alginate GO’s properties could potentially be used to develop cancer immunotherapies, improve drug delivery and aid in tissue engineering.</p>
<p class="p2">The study found that by adding a certain amount of GO to alginate gel, a jello-like substrate, a firmer gel is produced; this new gel can be used in ways distinct from the uses of pure alginate gel. Thomas Valentin GS , the principal investigator of the study, described the experimental process. First, the team tested if the mixture could behave like a liquid, a property which is ideal for particular kinds of 3D printing. Second, the researchers evaluated the mixture’s ability to withstand various pressure and stress tests.</p>
<p class="p2">The team found that the alginate GO mixture is stronger and stiffer than just alginate, all while behaving in the liquid-like manner required of biomaterials used for 3D printing. Valentin worked closely with co-investigators Alex Landauer ScM ’16 GS, Luke Morales ’18<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and other researchers based at the School of Engineering, University of Wisconsin and the National University of Singapore.</p>
<p class="p2">The researchers chose GO to add to the alginate because they knew it was “a material several orders of magnitude stiffer than alginate,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Valentin said. GO is unique because it is comprised of a sheet of “atomically thin carbon,” making it one of the strongest materials in the world.</p>
<p class="p2">The findings of this study build on Valentin’s previous work, which demonstrated that it was possible to 3D print using alginate through a process called stereolithography, whereby a laser beam passes over a vat of liquid and transforms selected liquid molecules into a solid shape.</p>
<p class="p2">Using the combination of stereolithography and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>alginate GO, scientists can now 3D print human organs with internal channels that mimic blood vessels in human tissues, a feat not previously possible using alginate alone because alginate is “too soft … and hard to handle,” Wong said.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3D-printed organ cells typically suffer from a short lifespan due to a lack of nutrient delivery to the center of the organ and its cells, which can lead to potential cell and organ death. Now that this new 3D printing technology allows for the printing of blood vessels throughout the organ, nutrient delivery to the centermost cells of the organ is possible, which increases the organ’s shelf life, Valentin said. These innovations will allow researchers to 3D print<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>vascular (blood vessel) systems. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Moving forward, the next step for researchers will be to further optimize the material for other properties, which in turn could lead to additional applications. Two properties that are most exciting to researchers are oil repellency and anti-fouling behavior. “If we optimize these, we could have many applications for marine anti-fouling, (such as) sensors that can take readings during an oil spill,” Valentin said. One day, the oil repelling abilities of alginate GO could be used to prevent fouling by oils and corrosion by seawater, he added.</p>
<p class="p2">Although GO is commonly added to various compounds, including certain types of plastics, this is the first time it has been used in biomaterials for 3D printing, said Robert Hurt, professor of engineering and founding director of the University’s Institute for Molecular and Nanoscale Innovation, whose research concerns environmental and biological safety testing of new materials. “The use of (GO) for 3D printing is a very specific application. You could easily take this further. It’s not expensive or difficult,” he said.</p>
&nbsp;

<em><strong>Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that “scientists can now 3D print human organs with blood vessels.” In fact, scientists can now 3D print biomaterials with internal channels that mimic blood vessels in human tissues. Therefore, the headline “Researchers improve 3D printed biomaterials” is more accurate. The article also mistitled Ian Wong as associate professor of molecular pharmacology, physiology, biotechnology and engineering. In fact, he is assistant professor of molecular pharmacology, physiology, biotechnology and engineering. The Herald regrets the errors. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>
