		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Jan. 20, 2017, President Donald Trump was sworn in, marking the first of the 1,462 days that the United States will be governed by a man who referred to journalists as being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.html">“among the most dishonest human beings on earth.”</a> This statement, while mild in comparison to the deplorable remarks Trump has made against immigrants, Muslims, women and many others, represents one of the primary challenges media organizations face today — distrust in news organizations as institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trump is not alone in this sentiment. A September 2016 Gallup poll showed that trust in mass media has hit a historic low. Only 32 percent of Americans surveyed in the poll indicated they have a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx">“great deal” or “fair amount”</a> of trust in mass media.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As leaders of a staff of student editors and reporters — many of whom are working to become professional journalists or writers — this distrust can be disheartening. Our staff members spend many hours researching, interviewing, fact-checking and copy-editing to make sure we put out an informative paper five times per week. Yet many people, including Trump, turn away from engaging with news outlets and instead turn toward places like Twitter, where complex ideas must be condensed to 140 characters or fewer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Acknowledging this distrust that exists, we hope to build your confidence in The Herald through the reporting we put forth. This year, our goals as a new editorial board are two-fold: First, challenge ourselves to do better as a platform for engagement. Second, challenge you, our readers and community, to help us do better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We aim to publish nuanced and well-reported stories that feature a wide variety of voices, including historically marginalized voices that may be particularly vulnerable under the Trump administration. Our opinions section should represent the diverse range of opinions at Brown, and we affirm that challenging someone’s ideas does not necessitate attacking the person himself. We aim to uphold standards that require our writers to think beyond simple preconceptions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We acknowledge the privilege that comes with serving as a platform for our community’s ideas and do not take this responsibility lightly. We will continue to put in those hours of research, transcribing, writing and editing every day. In an effort to be more transparent as an organization, we will also continue to outline our goals and perspectives through future editorials throughout this semester.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In parallel, we emphasize The Herald’s power to ignite conversations within the Brown community. The voices in our paper include students, administrators, alums and other community members who can and should communicate through The Herald.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Talk to our reporters, write us an op-ed or letter to the editor or join our staff if you’re a student — become a part of the conversation. Now, more than ever, no one can afford to be silent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Editorials are written by The Herald’s editorial board: Lauren Aratani ’18, Kate Talerico ’18, Matthew Brownsword ’18 and Rebecca Ellis ’18. Send comments to editorials@browndailyherald.com.</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On a Saturday night last year, I laid on the floor of my apartment bathroom deciding whether or not to call Brown Emergency Medical Services. I was intoxicated for only the second time in my life. I couldn’t stop vomiting alcohol as I started slipping in and out of consciousness. I desperately needed emergency care, but something was stopping me: the fear of punishment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For those who don’t know, be warned. At Brown University, if you use Brown EMS for alcohol abuse, the administration will find out and you will face University intervention. Yes, even if you are of legal drinking age. The underlying issue with this policy is that it inadvertently causes students to forgo medical care in potentially life-threatening situations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">My experience with alcohol is, unfortunately, not unique among college students. According to the National Institutes of Health, in any given month approximately 59.8 percent of U.S. college students between the ages of 18 and 22 use alcohol, and 37.9 percent of students engage in heavy drinking <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics">(defined by the NIH as having five or more drinks on a single occasion)</a>. The NIH also cites a study conducted between 2000 and 2008 that found a 25 percent increase in hospitalizations resulting from alcohol overdose among 18 to 24 year olds over this eight-year period. In 2008, there were 59,000 18 to 24 year olds hospitalized for alcohol-related overdoses in the United States, and in any given year approximately 1,800 college students die of <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arcr352/201-218.htm">alcohol overdose</a>. There’s no denying the simple fact: The vast majority of college students drink. Brown students are no exception.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A Cornell study in 2000 reported that 19 percent of students had thought about calling for help because they were concerned about someone who was severely intoxicated, but only 4 percent actually made the call. After Cornell instituted its Medical Amnesty Protocol — under which students are not punished for using EMS in cases of alcohol abuse — there was a 61 percent decrease in students citing the fear of “getting in trouble” as a barrier to using EMS for alcohol abuse, <a href="https://www.gannett.cornell.edu/cms/pdf/aod/upload/Safety1stcornellMedamnesty.pdf">the study showed</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Though Brown claims to have a medical amnesty policy, the University still takes action. If you use Brown EMS for alcohol abuse, you can expect to receive a letter from the dean of student life and the Office of Student Conduct. This letter forces you to attend a meeting with University personnel about your alcohol abuse. According to the letter I received on April 25, 2016, following my EMS call,“if you do not complete this requirement by said date, you will be charged with the following offense: Offense V,” which is the failure to comply with proper directives of a University official. If charged with the offense, you will have to attend an academic hearing where punishment can include suspension and even expulsion from the university. All of this can happen even if you are over 21.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In fact, <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/student-life/sites/brown.edu.about.administration.student-life/files/uploads/Code%20of%20Student%20Conduct.pdf">Brown’s Code of Student Conduct</a> explicitly includes “unauthorized use of alcohol” as a student conduct violation and leaves it up to the “determination of a dean” whether a student “misused alcohol.” The code goes one step further to state that an offending student “will be required to undergo appropriate alcohol education, evaluation, and/or treatment as determined by appropriate officials.” Not only are “unauthorized use of alcohol”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and “alcohol misuse” incredibly vague, but apparently the administration also has the discretion to determine who has misused alcohol and what “appropriate treatment” constitutes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first issue with this procedure is one of respect for students’ rights. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, patients have a right to confidentiality of health information. HIPAA stemmed from the realization that the sharing of medical information beyond necessary medical personnel has negative impacts on other aspects of patients’ lives. HIPAA was meant to ensure that patients could seek confidential medical care without fear that their employer or university would find out and fire, expel or make special demands of them in the workplace.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Brown administration claims that the method by which they find out about incidents of alcohol abuse, their subsequent requirement of special meetings with University personnel and the possibility of an academic hearing are all legal under HIPAA because it is the campus police — not medical personnel bound by HIPAA — who inform deans about student alcohol abuse, thereby skirting the act. Even if Brown’s actions are technically legal, they undermine the entire intent of HIPAA. The bottom line is that students have a right to seek medical care without fear that any information will be shared with the University and used to force them to attend special meetings or face the potential of an academic hearing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the larger issue is that the administration’s response to EMS use for alcohol abuse puts student lives in danger. By forcing students to attend mandatory meetings to discuss their alcohol abuse (which is a personal medical issue), and by threatening students with academic hearings and suspension, Brown is creating fear of punishment as a barrier to EMS use.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">During personal meetings I had with the Director of Brown Health Services Dr. Unab Khan, she pointed out that another reason for the University’s harsh response is that students who use EMS for alcohol abuse may disrupt and burden the community. But this reasoning seems misplaced and illogical. By this standard, any Brown student with a medical issue that disrupts or burdens the community should be forced to attend mandatory meetings with the administration and face the possibility of suspension or expulsion — an obviously flawed and unfair premise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown’s current medical amnesty policy is unfortunately not an outlier among Ivy League institutions. All Ivy League schools seem to have some sort of medical amnesty policy for alcohol and other drugs, but none clarify exactly what or how much student medical information is shared with administrators or what academic sanctions the student may incur. All of these supposedly progressive institutions, including Brown, are missing the point: Their current medical amnesty policies still don’t put student health and safety above all else. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The simple solution is to keep student medical information about alcohol abuse and EMS use within Brown Health Services and to prohibit campus police from sharing it with the general administration unless the student requests otherwise. Medically trained staff at Health Services should be responsible for contacting students who abuse alcohol about counseling and other alcohol support services. In the case that alcohol abuse continues to inhibit a student’s academic success, medical staff should handle the process and planning of a medical leave for students so they can focus on the rehabilitation care they need before finishing their studies at Brown. A student should never be suspended or expelled by the general administration for a medical issue, including alcohol abuse.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Friday, President Donald Trump banned citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. The executive order — made just a week after Trump was officially sworn in as president — has affected the lives of thousands, including many members of our community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trump’s order was executed with little thought paid to the legal system that was built to protect the very immigrants it now bans. The purpose of the order is to protect the United States “from foreign terrorist entry into the United States,” though experts, who Trump diligently ignores, have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/politics/a-sweeping-order-unlikely-to-reduce-terrorist-threat.html?te=1&amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20170130">pointed out</a> that the order will be ineffective at doing so. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thoughtlessness created this situation. Now, careful action is needed to get us out of it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a news organization, we have and will continue to cover the effects the ban and the policies of the Trump administration have on our community with truth and care, noting that our community is one of many that has been touched by the executive order. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We encourage the University to use its power as an institution to protect those who are affected by the immigration ban. A number of universities, such as the <a href="http://president.umich.edu/news-communications/on-the-agenda/protecting-the-interests-of-our-international-community-of-scholars/">University of Michigan</a>, <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2017/january/a-message-from-nyu-president-andrew-hamilton-about-the-recent-ex.html">New York University</a> and Cornell have publicly voiced the ways that they will be helping their students. Michigan released a statement asserting it would refuse to release the immigration information of any of its students unless required to do so by law. NYU similarly refused to allow the federal government to collect any information on immigrant students sans subpoena. As lawyers flocked to airports across America to work pro bono for those being prepared for deportation, <a href="http://statements.cornell.edu/2017/20170129-immigration-exec-order.cfm">Cornell</a> said it was exploring opening up its law school, offering free legal consultations to students affected by the executive order. We applaud the University for its op-ed in The Herald on Monday that reaffirmed our community’s values in this difficult time, but we call on them to take more concrete steps. While we acknowledge that there may be specific circumstances that prevent Brown from taking the measures established by other colleges, the University should prioritize using its time and energy to keep our community safe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you know any students or faculty members affected by this bans, we encourage you to reach out to the Office of International Student and Scholar Services team at 401-863-2427. For non-visa related concerns, contact the Office of Global Engagement at 401-863-1300. Other members of the community should reach out to their local American Civil Liberties Union office for legal assistance. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The women’s basketball team, our representative in the inaugural Ivy League tournament, has had a strong year, capping its season by sweeping Columbia and Cornell over the weekend to finish fourth in the conference and earn its postseason berth. We wish the Bears success against Penn at the Palestra on a potential underdog run to their first NCAA tournament since 1994. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ask any top athletic or academic administrator at the highest levels at Brown about the success of our athletes, and they’ll agree that our athletes accomplish amazing things during and after their Brown careers: Brown’s athletes <a href="http://www.brownbears.com/general/ncaaapr2016">ranked first</a> among all NCAA Division I schools in academic achievement last year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But out of the seven most popular collegiate sports — hockey, baseball, softball, lacrosse, soccer, football and basketball — two of Brown’s teams have an average Ivy League winning percentage of over .500 in the last five years: men’s soccer and men’s lacrosse. It comes as no surprise that out of Brown’s 29 Ivy League championships since 2000, those two programs have 10 of them. Outside of our representation in the nation’s most popular sports, Brown consistently excels in men’s water polo, men and women’s crew and women’s skiing. And after a study from the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/01/study-illustrates-u-class-disparities/">Equality of Opportunity Project</a> showed Brown is one of several colleges where students from the top 1 percent outnumber students from the bottom 60 percent, it might be telling that the sports Brown excels at can mirror the image of privilege <a href="https://www.aspenprojectplay.org/the-facts">reinforced by the data</a>. </span></p>

[media-credit id=2075 align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-2825194" src="http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IvyChampionships_EliWhite-300x161.jpg" alt="IvyChampionships_EliWhite" width="300" height="161" />[/media-credit]
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We’re certainly not charging the University with favoring some sports over others. There is a pattern for consistent success in our top athletic programs; however, there are lessons to be learned from Brown’s inability to compete in an Ivy League conference it helped found.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our women’s rugby program advanced to the varsity level three years ago and was instantly a model program. The team went 11-2-1, winning a conference title in the first year of the program’s existence. In year two, the team lost to Dartmouth twice and was the runner-up in the Ivy League. This year, Brown lost to Harvard, Princeton and Dartmouth, winning just one Ivy League game. Success in Ivy League sports certainly comes and goes, but it’s interesting that co-captain Oksana Goretaya ’17 expressed concern about institutional investment in the team last year.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Give it a year or two, and we won’t be able to compete anymore because other teams have a full side of recruited players, and we’ll have walk-ons,” she said, noting that new rugby teams at Harvard and Dartmouth were given recruiting spots immediately after becoming varsity sports, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/04/27/unsuccessful-teams-reflect-institutional-athletic-changes/">The Herald previously reported</a>. Brown spent $749,571 on recruiting in the 2014-15 academic year — only Penn spent less — while four other teams in the Ivy League spent over a million dollars. Brown was one of two schools to spend under $300,000 on recruiting for women’s athletics — Penn was the other. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown also pays its women’s team’s coaches the lowest average salary in the Ivy League and its men’s team’s head coaches<a href="https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/compare/details"> the second lowest</a>. After two successful seasons at Brown, former men’s lacrosse coach Lars Tiffany ’90 departed to the University of Virginia — one example of how difficult it can be to hold onto high-profile coaches without paying them a competitive salary. While Mike Daly seems an apt successor after building a Division III powerhouse at Tufts, one has to wonder how the never-ending shuffle of head coaches can affect the perception of Brown among elite high school athletes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The connection to dollars spent and athletic success is well-documented: Brown’s men's basketball team has won two Ivy League titles, the fewest in conference history. In 2014, Brown’s total expenses for men's basketball were the lowest in the Ivy League. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown is the only school that has received less than 30 conference titles in the last 17 years — the lowest in the Ivy League. Penn — the only school to consistently spend similar amounts to Brown — has won 57 in that same time frame. Since 2010, Brown has won five Ivy League titles in all sports —<a href="https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/compare/details"> again the fewest in the league</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s not as if Brown’s athletes, teams or their recruiting prowess can not stack up to the titans of the Ancient Eight — Harvard, Yale and Princeton — or even top national programs. Brown field hockey beat No. 14 Louisville in 2013. In 2014, Brown basketball beat a Providence team that was a six seed in the NCAA tournament. Brown men’s hockey beat No. 6 Harvard in 2015 and No.1 Providence last season. Christian Taugner ’17 kept the number one baseball team in the country to one run, Caroline Morant ’17 is racking up all-around titles and Ivy first-team accolades and three juniors on the men’s hockey team were drafted by NHL teams. Dylan Molloy ’17 was the winner of the most prestigious award in college lacrosse last year and has made a name for himself across the college game. Yet, this University consistently ranks among the lowest in the Ivy League in championships, awards and wins across the board. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We know that not all students may be interested in attending an athletic event at Brown, partly due to Brown’s lack of athletic success. We hope all those who take a t-shirt stay to cheer on the Bears, but as former Herald sports editor Alex Wainger ’16 pointed out in a February 2016 column <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/19/wainger-16-come-for-the-shirt-stay-for-the-game/">“Come for the shirt, stay for the game,”</a> interest in sports is not ingrained in Brown’s culture. Hopefully, the success of the men’s lacrosse team in the NCAA tournament last season, and the increase in interest in the men’s and women’s basketball teams — with postseason berths on the line — display the effects that success has on attendance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We would like to see accountability and consistent oversight bolstering a desire to compete with peer institutions on the field. Whether it be increased efforts at athletic investment or refocusing the department, it is clear that a change has to be made. We write this with an understanding that some readers will point to necessary spending in other areas of the University as a detriment to our athletic spending and performance. That theory is outdated. Improving academics, diversity and structure makes Brown a more inclusive and attractive place to recruits who won’t receive an athletic scholarship from the Ivy League. Increasing financial aid across the board allows Brown to recruit exceptional athletes from all different backgrounds. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sports are a source of traditional and present-day community, linking two generations far apart by a common thread. Sports bring alums back to campus in support of their University. Sports can unite Brown students, administrators, faculty, staff and community members behind a common cause. In a response to a <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2017/02/27/aronson-admissions-and-athletics/">column published</a> in the Yale Daily News Feb. 27 that argued Yale should not recruit athletes, Emily Reinwald, a senior at Yale, <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2017/02/28/letter-2-28-2/">defended the way athletes</a> are embraced in Yale’s mission statement — one not dissimilar from Brown, which used to require students to take a swim test in order to graduate. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The women’s basketball team plays Penn at 11 a.m. Saturday. Go Bruno.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">E</span>very year during the spring semester, The Herald endorses candidates for contested Undergraduate Council of Students and Undergraduate Finance Board executive positions. Endorsements are typically made after the editorial board meets with the candidates to discuss their respective ideas and platforms. This year, because several candidates refused to seek endorsement from The Herald, we will not endorse any UCS or UFB candidates.</p>
<p class="p3">We want to acknowledge the pain The Herald has caused marginalized communities, particularly through the racist columns that were published in fall 2015 and want to highlight steps that The Herald has taken to repair our relationships with the Brown community <span class="s1">and ensure accurate and fair content</span>. We have looked internally and reflected on our role as a teaching organization, where students learn how to run a newspaper and help the campus become more informed and engaged. We understand that we do not truly fulfill our mission if our staff does not reflect the diversity of the student body. We acknowledge this internal problem and wish to also shed light on some of the efforts we have made in the past three semesters to make The Herald more diverse and inclusive.</p>
<p class="p3">In spring 2016, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/15/editorial-revamping-commentary/">overhauled the opinions section</a> to remedy the process that led to the publication of fall 2015’s racist op-eds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where op-ed contributors and staff columnists used to have their pieces edited online, not in the presence of an opinions editors, contributors to our opinions section now come into the office to have their piece edited in person.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In fall 2016, The Herald also introduced a diversity and inclusion advocate role. Now in its second semester, the role is currently filled by two of our section editors who have reached out to various student groups of color on campus and advocate for students of color who work for The Herald by facilitating internal discussions. The Herald has also held a series of workshops within the past year, including ones run by the Brown Center for Students of Color, Sarah Doyle Women’s Center, Social Justice Peer Educators and Counseling and Psychological Services. To ensure that we accurately cover all communities on campus, participation in these workshops was mandatory for staff members who write and edit our articles.</span></p>
<p class="p3">We understand The Herald has so much more work to do. But when the candidates say that The Herald is “exploiting narratives of students of color and low-income students,” and “misconstruing and falsely manufacturing narratives,” they erase the work of countless staff members — and most poignantly our staff members who are themselves students of color and low-income students — who make these narratives visible in our paper every day.</p>
<p class="p3">Students of color, low-income students and students of all marginalized identities deserve a voice in our paper — to be heard not only by their peers who read The Herald, but also by alums and administrators who stay informed about campus concerns through our paper. We believe that our coverage this semester has demonstrated care for the issues that these students face. Our revamped opinions section has also worked to start conversations about important campus issues. We encourage you, our readers, to follow our coverage daily and hold us accountable when you do not see articles or columns that fairly represent the Brown community. We have also reached out to the candidates to begin a conversation with them.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">With our past in mind, we affirm and support the work our entire staff has done to bring The Herald to where it is today. We continue to dedicate ourselves to pushing a more inclusive Herald forward.</span></p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Dear Class of 2021,</p>
<p class="p2">You may have spent hours pondering over your response to the simple question “Why Brown?” when completing your application. Now, as the University’s A Day on College Hill begins and hundreds of prospective students ascend upon College Hill, it is our time to answer the question — and, this time, we aren’t limited to a character count.</p>
<p class="p2">Whether it be the flexibility of the open curriculum, the opportunity to learn from esteemed (and, often, incredibly cool) faculty members or the ability to say you go to the school that Emma Watson ’14 graduated from, we at The Herald can offer many compelling answers to “Why Brown?”</p>
<p class="p2">While we can’t honestly say that Brown is anything akin to Hogwarts, we can say that the magic of Brown comes from the people within this community. Here, you’ll meet students from around the world who genuinely love what they do on campus and combine that passion with concrete action.</p>
<p class="p2">As often as the promotional pamphlets and brochures mention the open curriculum, we can attest to how it allows students to tailor their pathway during their time in college — and allows room for a little exploration along the way. You will always have the opportunity to carve your own course path. At Brown, you won’t be surprised to come across the aspiring medical student dabbling in history or the computer scientist who does aerial arts on the side. The same person you just played basketball with at the OMAC could be your teaching assistant.</p>
<p class="p2">As the editors of The Herald, we know that, even with the amazing people here, the University is not always the perfect bastion of academic learning. Many of the voices featured in our paper critique the campus and its shortcomings, often from a desire to see positive change that will affect future generations of students, such as yourselves. We hope that, in choosing Brown, you will help us to continue improving this school we love.</p>
<p class="p2">Brown has already been a school that inspires change. This is the school where its own female student-athletes led the charge in defending Title IX <a href="http://www.titleix.info/resources/Legal-Cases/Cohen-v-Brown-University.aspx">policies</a>. It’s a school that created one of the first centers of public service in <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2012/09/swearer">1986</a>, and, in 2016, unveiled the first-generation and low-income student <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/22/as-first-gen-advocacy-grows-center-established-for-cause/">center</a> — not to mention the wide-ranging hubs of discourse and action that have been created in between. Brown fosters a culture of choice, independence and personal action in a way that few other schools can. We hope you’ll join us.</p>

		<title>Editorial: Talking to a Herald reporter</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s possible that over the course of your time at Brown you’ll be asked to interact with one of our reporters. We try to cover the Brown community and include as many voices as possible —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>so when a reporter speaks with you, we hope that you’ll have a positive experience with them and feel that they represented what you said fairly and accurately.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Per our mission, The Herald is a teaching organization, and we train our reporters how to do the job the way a professional would. Many of them have had no experience in journalism before. We realize that, before interacting with a Herald reporter, you may have had no experience interacting with the media yourself. Here’s what to expect if you’re talking with a reporter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. We try to avoid conflicts of interest. If a reporter is too close to a story, someone else will probably be reporting on it. This can be a tough line to draw, and we address it on a case by case basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. There are a few ways you might talk to a reporter about a story. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">•<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you’re “on the record,” that means that anything you say can be reported, published or aired with your name attached. All conversations are assumed to be on the record unless you, a source, explicitly request to go off the record and the reporter agrees.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">• You might ask a reporter to only speak “on background,” which means that the reporter can print what you say without naming you. You’re probably just giving background information on a story that our reporters will go elsewhere to verify.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">• If what you’re saying is “not for attribution,” that means that you’re an anonymous source in an article. How we identify you should be agreed upon by the reporter and the source (you). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">• “Off the record” means our reporter is limited in using the information you give. You might speak with a reporter off the record if you want them to help them understand an issue or event without being published. But, if the reporter confirms that same information with someone who spoke on the record, either on background, not for attribution, or otherwise, then she can publish that — but your name won’t be attached to the information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. By attaching quotes and information to an identified person, readers understand where our information comes from, and we build trust. Our first obligation is to readers and to truth. But we understand some information you divulge to a reporter may be sensitive. On rare occasions, a reporter may grant anonymity. But first, that reporter has to check with her editor, and there must be a good reason to be anonymous. Even if you’re an anonymous source in the paper, our reporter still needs to know your first and last name.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Our reporters should identify themselves to you and let you know they’re with The Herald. If a reporter asks to record a conversation with you, we encourage you to let them, if you’re comfortable with that — recording a conversation makes it much easier for us to quote you directly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5. It’s against most newspapers’ policies to show you an article before it’s published, and it’s our policy, too. We can call you and read your quotes to you, and we can call you to confirm facts that you’ve given us, but we’re not allowed to change a quote of yours to make it sound better. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6. If you say something at a public event, such as a protest or meeting of the Undergraduate Council of Students, we may quote you. We cover newsworthy events, and that sometimes includes recording events that take place in public settings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">7. We do our best to be fair and accurate, but we sometimes make mistakes. If you have a factual correction to make on an article, email the reporter or herald@browndailyherald.com and we’ll publish a correction online as soon as possible and in our print version the following day. If you feel that the article was not fair, then write a letter to the editor at letters@browndailyherald.com. If it’s fit to print, we’ll publish it. This is a way to hold us accountable and set the record straight for our readers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like most of you, we’re students. We’re all volunteers who are committed to our mission: producing news and other content to inform the Brown community. Like any student group, our staff turns over every few years. We’re always working to improve and learn. Judge us by our product and our conduct, today and in the years to come.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Years from now, when people want to know what life at Brown was like when we went there, they’ll likely turn to The Herald. We want to make sure that we’re providing an accurate historical representation of the student body, which means talking to you to understand what’s happening on campus. We hope that, with these guidelines, you’ll feel more comfortable knowing how to deal with the media and will speak with a reporter the next time you’re asked for an interview.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Editorials are written by The Herald’s editorial board: Lauren Aratani ’18, Matt Brownsword ’18, Rebecca Ellis ’18 and Kate Talerico ’18.</i></span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Prasad: Our commitment to international students</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/14/commitment-international-students/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Herald’s article, “U. Hires new international student experience program director” (Sept. 13) underscores the importance the University is placing on offering essential resources to support our international students at Brown. It also provides an opportunity to outline additional steps we are taking to address some of the concerns raised in the article, such as student access to the resources we offer to support their scholarship and to navigate Brown effectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Among Brown’s greatest strengths are the breadth and depth of the diversity of our community. It is only by bringing together the most talented individuals in the world, from an array of perspectives, nationalities and experiences, that we are able to fulfill our mission at the highest levels. Central to this is our community of international students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This academic year, we welcome 257 international undergraduates and 322 international graduate students to the Brown community. These individuals join the more than 1,930 international students at Brown who collectively comprise 14 percent of our undergraduate population and 37 percent of the graduate population. Their influence and impact goes far beyond these numbers, and ensuring that they are able to thrive academically and engage fully in the Brown experience requires thoughtful and relevant support.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The hiring of a director for the international student experience highlights the most recent example of key investments that the University is making to strengthen the international student experience. As <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/12/08/office-global-engagement-seeks-build-community-student-resources/">The Herald reported</a>, we have also welcomed a new assistant provost for global engagement, launched a new international fellows program in partnership with the Graduate School, re-launched the international student advisory board and will be co-locating all of the global offices to J. Walter Wilson in January 2018. This co-location will reinforce the launch of Global Brown Community and Support, our one-stop referral service to streamline help across the more than 40 staff and multiple offices that support the international community at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This fall, we look forward to welcoming a new assistant dean of the College for international students, who will fill a critical need for dedicated academic advising and professional development for international undergraduates. In addition, a new international lounge in JWW in the spring will provide a space for this community to gather and collaborate.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We recognize that while progress has been made, more work is needed to fully support our international student scholars. We welcome feedback to shape our efforts and are planning a second installment of our international student survey this spring.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We benefit enormously from the full engagement and contributions of our international students and remain committed to ensuring that they are able to thrive during their time at Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><em><span class="s1">Shankar Prasad is the associate provost for global engagement and strategic initiatives. He can be reached at </span><span class="s1">shankar_prasad@brown.edu. Please send responses to this opinion to letters@browndailyherald.com and other op-eds to opinions@browndailyherald.com.</span></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When seeking fair, balanced reporting on the Brown community, we hope that you’ll turn to The Herald. In addition, our newspaper is a venue for several types of opinion pieces. We recognize that the two can often be confused — a trend we’re hoping to set straight as you continue to read The Herald and other newspapers beyond Brown.</p>
<p class="p3">We hope to be as transparent as possible about when our content includes opinion and when it should not. Beyond its regular news coverage, The Herald publishes six types of content that include opinion — columns, op-eds, letters to the editor, editorials, reviews and cartoons. Columns are written by our Herald opinions columnists — who must apply to the job — and edited by our team of opinions editors. The opinions pages are staffed by a team separate from our reporters and editors who create our daily news content. Op-eds are contributed by Brown community members who do not belong to The Herald’s staff, including other students, alums, faculty and staff members and administrators. Letters to the editor typically are written by readers who aim to include a perspective lacking in the newspaper or comment on the way The Herald handled an editorial decision. They might also be a short response to a specific article. Reviewers will offer their criticism and analysis of new movies, art, films, albums or sports. Cartoonists typically present an opinion through emotional appeals, logic or humor. All of these receive a final edit by the editorial board, who correct not only for grammar and style, but also strive to ensure that the piece reasonably defends a position.</p>
<p class="p3">The editorial board, currently in its 127th iteration, writes editorials, which assert the opinion of the newspaper editors. The 127th editorial board, which also oversees the day-to-day operations and the Herald’s staff, writes the editorials. We hope that, in this way, editorials will accurately represent the opinions of The Herald’s leadership.</p>
<p class="p3">To be clear: While the editorial board does help to shape the daily coverage of the news section, we teach our reporters to abide by journalistic integrity and to report on subjects as objectively as possible. Of course, The Herald recognizes that pure objectivity is unachievable. Both the experiences of the writers and the institution around them can shape their perspective — but we always aim for fairness and balance in all of our news reporting. If you don’t believe we have been fair, talk to us by submitting a letter to the editor to set the record straight.</p>
<p class="p3">In June, the Duke Reporters’ lab found that only 40 percent of large news organizations signal the type of article for their readers online. In the pages of the newspaper, we do our best to separate news from opinion. In the print edition, all opinion-based content is labeled under “Commentary” at the top of the page. Online, we label editorials with “Editorial:” and opinions columns with the author’s name — both in the headline and the byline to ensure clarity.</p>
<p class="p3">Our opinion writing, in addition to our daily news coverage, serves our journalistic mission: to provide people with the information they need to be good citizens and make rational choices. We hope that both types of content we provide will inform, entertain and serve as a spark for discussion within the Brown community.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Editorials are written by The Herald’s 127th editorial board: Lauren Aratani ’18, Matthew Brownsword ’18, Rebecca Ellis ’18 and Kate Talerico ’18.</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>WBRU sale could put direction of station back in student’s hands</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For as long as current seniors have been at Brown, the running joke amongst WBRU staffers has been how much they hate listening to the station’s music itself. The looping streams of Coldplay and Red Hot Chili Peppers might have brought in Providence’s alternative music-seekers for the last several years, but the records hadn’t reflected the musical tastes of the Brown community for some time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the midst of declining profits and a collapsing radio market, WBRU decided to sell its terrestrial signal to the highest bidder this summer. And while the sale itself was fraught with contention and internal drama, the Brown community can also view it as a way to move forward. As WBRU takes the plunge into online-only streaming content, the digital pivot offers an exciting opportunity for students to reshape the station without pressure from ratings and advertisers. We’re anticipating music that more closely aligns with what staffers listen to themselves, rather than what they played to allay advertisers’ concerns. WBRU.com, where the station will host its now digital-only content, shows signs that a new mobile application may soon be on the way. Some students are working on creating a news podcast. And WBRU doesn’t show any signs of downsizing, as it certainly hasn’t slowed its recruitment efforts (as at least one Herald editorial board member who never got removed from their listserv can tell you).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Switching over to digital-only content won’t be easy, though — whether or not WBRU can maintain the same advertising to keep the budget at similar levels as past years remains to be seen. While the $5.63 million sale does provide the station with immediate funds (as well as plenty to start an endowment to fund the station for years onward), advertising will be necessary if the station projects a long-term future for itself. How they carve out a spot for themselves within the competition for advertising remains to be seen, especially as students are quicker to turn to their own playlists on Spotify than WBRU’s. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As editors of The Herald, we can’t help but be huge fans of college media in all its forms. But amidst the invaluable professional experience and mentorship, many of us have fallen on hard times, spurring the shift toward digital platforms where competition for advertising is stiff. Still, digital is where media needs to get creative right now. WBRU has prided itself as an organization at the forefront of independent media, but they can only be at the forefront if they’re actively working to pursue new projects. That’s why we see the sale as a positive development — now that WBRU is no longer constrained to limitations of a terrestrial signal, it can devote its staff’s energy to developing solutions for its new platforms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While WBRU’s shift may have been forced and unpleasant for some current staffers, we hope they also see it as an opportunity. WBRU made a name for itself as one of the first independent radio stations. We’re excited to see where it takes independent radio next, and we hope you’ll join us in listening.</span></p>

		<title>Grigo &#039;18: It’s not the time to ‘stick to sports’</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/05/not-time-stick-sports/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">If it wasn’t obvious before, it has now become clear: “Stick to sports” is nothing more than a hypocritical tool used to undermine the political participation of athletes.</p>
<p class="p3">For the uninitiated, “stick to sports” is a common criticism aimed at sports reporters and athletes who wade into political territory with their columns or public statements rather than settle for analysis focusing on defensive schemes, salary caps and the latest trading block buzz.</p>
<p class="p3">It’s a simplistic concept that doesn’t make any sense. “Stick to sports” suffers from a crippling logical failure: After all, the very act of attempting to police what people say is profoundly political. More importantly, “stick to sports” naively assumes that sports naturally exist in some apolitical bubble that only gets punctured when journalists or athletes go out of their way to pursue a political agenda. But this is blatantly not the case: The structure of the professional sports leagues and the NCAA engenders class warfare waged between the leagues’ players and their <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/11257692/ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-suspended-2-games">wealthy capitalist owners</a>. The underrepresentation of people of color and women in high-level front office positions within sports franchises is a concrete manifestation of a culture that continues to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nba-rooney-rule-front-office-diversity-lacking-article-1.3355647">systematically</a> favor white men. The mere two-game suspension Ray Rice received in 2014 for sucker-punching his girlfriend revealed the NFL’s <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/11257692/ray-rice-baltimore-ravens-suspended-2-games">apathy</a> regarding domestic violence. I could go on, but the point is clear: Sports are about people, and anything involving people is political.</p>
<p class="p3">There has been, of course, very little sticking to sports recently. Last fall, Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem before each game in protest of police brutality, a demonstration other NFL players have joined in on this season even as Kaepernick remains a free agent. Then, during a speech in Alabama two weeks ago, President Trump recommended NFL owners deal with players who kneel by getting each <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests">“son of a bitch off the field”</a> and firing them. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and several owners, including Trump’s friend Robert Kraft, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/23/politics/nfl-goodell-trump-response/index.html">criticized</a> the president’s comments. Three teams — the Pittsburgh Steelers, Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee Titans — refused to take the field for the anthem on Sept. 24 in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/sports/nfl-trump-anthem-protests.html">protest</a>. That same weekend, Trump rescinded the NBA champion Golden State Warriors’ invitation to Washington, D.C., after star guard Stephen Curry had announced he didn’t want to celebrate his team’s championship at the White House due to the president’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2017/09/23/stephen-curry-steve-kerr-and-the-warriors-respond-to-president-trump/">beliefs</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">If nothing else, the president’s bid at censoring professional athletes he disagrees with made clear that “stick to sports” is a disempowering, mindless slogan invoked by those privileged enough to not be directly impacted by the systemic injustices currently poisoning our society.</p>
<p class="p3">And don’t expect the players to pipe down any time soon: Trump is now the biggest story in sports, and if the past few weeks are any indication, the jocks seem poised to lead the resistance.</p>
<p class="p3">While it’s true that sports have always been inescapably political, we find ourselves at a particularly delicate moment — a time when the politics of the athletes in America’s favorite sports leagues, the diverse NBA and NFL, are inevitably clashing with the values held by our president. Let me be clear: Most of Trump’s actions throughout his adult life — from his 1989 ad campaign to have the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/opinion/why-trump-doubled-down-on-the-central-park-five.html">“Central Park Five”</a> executed to his “very fine people” comment in the wake of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/">Charlottesville</a> — suggest that he, at the very least, sympathizes with white supremacy.</p>
<p class="p3">The black athletes who populate nearly three-quarters of the NBA and NFL rosters are uniquely equipped to protest such bigotry, even as so-called “real Americans” denigrate them as unpatriotic, ungrateful “brats,” to quote the comments section of the right-wing website <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/09/21/nfl-players-whove-protested-national-anthem-want-league-to-endorse-social-activism-month-memo-says/">The Blaze</a>. Sport is one of the few spheres of life where African Americans have a platform large enough to shape public discourse regarding racial inequality.</p>
<p class="p3">But even as we elevate black superstars like LeBron James for the entertainment value they provide us, we invalidate those same athletes’ political views by telling them to “stick to sports” and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>intentionally misrepresenting their positions.</p>
<p class="p3">We insist on calling the anthem protests disrespectful to our military and country even though they are explicitly not anti-military or anti-American demonstrations, but seek to emphasize the racial injustice of police brutality in a peaceful and profoundly American way. We insist on referring to the legitimate concerns of black athletes as “petulant” and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/09/23/hey-golden-state-warriors-president-trump-honors-winners-not-whiners.html">“whin(y).”</a> And we insist on rationalizing the blackballing of the NFL’s Colin Kaepernick, a man guilty of having the nerve to underscore the systemic injustice perpetrated against black men in the United States by refusing to stand for an anthem that — lest we forget — honors the flag of a country founded on the enslavement of his ancestors.</p>
<p class="p3">That type of rhetoric serves no purpose other than to deny athletes their basic humanity. But the events of recent weeks have proved that players recognize the folly of sticking to sports in a country that has permitted the rise of Trumpism, and they appear united in the effort to dismantle both the credibility of this president and the pervasive racial biases that have plagued the United States since its inception.</p>
<p class="p3">Sports have finally embraced the resistance — and all because Donald Trump couldn’t stick to politics.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finance and consulting interns have long been the subject of jokes about selling out. The eager, inspired first-years who often walk in through the Van Wickle Gates praising democratic action sometimes cringe to find themselves after graduation joining institutions that fundamentally undermine it. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5060844a-0420-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9?mhq5j=e5">Wall Street spent $2 billion</a> trying to influence the 2016 election, often slanting toward GOP candidates. Money rolling in from billionaires and hedge fund managers undoubtedly <a href="https://www.salon.com/2012/04/01/how_billionaires_destroy_democracy/">influences</a> our democracy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a while, those who seek employment at tech companies have remained absent from the sellout mockery. Companies like Facebook and Google have imbued their employees with the idea that they are going to make the world a better place, all while making upwards of $100,000 in starting salary, too. And while eating free lunches every day and coding a small part of a giant product, it’s easy for recent graduates to feel like they’re doing good while they’re doing well for themselves. As Franklin Foer writes in his recent book “World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech”, “Big tech considers the concentration of power in its companies — in the networks they control — an urgent social good.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world-changing language is even reflected in Facebook’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/22/15855202/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-new-mission-statement-groups">mission statement</a>: “To give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” Google democratizes knowledge. Twitter democratizes how people communicate. But as more and more information comes out about how Russia used Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to intervene in the 2016 elections, students pursuing employment in tech must realize that they are complicit in undermining our democracy, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Posts disseminated by Russian agents reached 126 million users on Facebook, the New York Times reported <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html?_r=0">Monday</a>. Additionally, these agents sent out more than 131,000 Tweets and uploaded over 1,000 videos to YouTube. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has admitted how tech faulted. “Things happened on our platform in this election that should not have happened,” she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/technology/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-ads.html">said</a> in an onstage interview last week with journalist Mike Allen. Yet Facebook, which like so many other tech companies has remained unscathed and unaccountable for its <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/10/29/560461835/how-russian-propaganda-spreads-on-social-media">actions</a>, offered up no real specifics about the platform’s missteps that led to the interference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have claimed “neutrality” in an effort to protect free speech. But these policies are dangerous: Google News populates its feed with stories from the Russian government-backed outlet RT, normalizing a source that federal intelligence officials have called “the Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet.” In profit-seeking, Facebook and Twitter sold ads to operatives connected to the Russian government. And beyond that, Mark Zuckerberg has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-tried-to-give-zuckerberg-a-wake-up-call-over-fake-news-on-facebook/2017/09/24/15d19b12-ddac-4ad5-ac6e-ef909e1c1284_story.html?utm_term=.82ef4e90b0a7">denied</a> that the spread of fake news on Facebook at all influenced the election.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no doubt that by joining tech, graduates will make an impact, but let’s not be naive about what that influence entails. Certainly, one could argue that the benefits tech companies have brought to our democracy outweigh the sacrifices they may have made in doing so. But so long as these tech companies claim neutrality, University graduates cannot take their job offers without understanding that they are a part of a platform that has refused to be accountable when our democracy is at stake. It’s not just Wall Street anymore: When lured to Silicon Valley with multi-thousand dollar signing bonuses,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>new graduates should weigh whether or not the company they may be choosing to join is one whose work they are comfortable being complicit in.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On Nov. 16, the Providence City Council <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/31/magee-street-renamed-bannister-st/">will decide</a> whether a street on College Hill will continue to share the name of a slave trader or if it should instead find a new namesake in two of Providence’s most influential black activists. The decision is clear — Providence should change the name of Magee Street to Bannister Street.</p>
<p class="p1">The Bannisters represent some of the best Providence’s history has to offer. Edward Bannister was a gifted painter, and his wife Christiana was perhaps even more savvy — a local businesswoman, she founded Providence’s Home for Aged Colored Women, which lives on to this day as the <a href="http://centershealthcare.com/bannister_center/">Bannister Center</a> on Dodge Street. Already, the University has taken steps to honor the Bannisters by renovating the family’s <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/02/27/sweren-15-sale-bannister-house/">former residence</a> at <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/25/u-reveals-bannister-house-after-completed-renovations/)">93 Benevolent St</a>. Now the opportunity falls to the city, and they should make the same decision.</p>
<p class="p1">Providence’s role in the slave trade cannot be erased, and we must continue to acknowledge that history. But by commemorating a man who profited from racism and slavery, we are not making progress. Historic wrongs must be confronted, not ingrained into the built environment to a point where they may go unnoticed by passersby.</p>
<p class="p1">We support Stages of Freedom’s initiative to rename a street in honor of the Bannisters, and what better street than Magee?</p>

		<title>Editorial: We can’t be silent about gun violence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When, in December 2012, a shooter fatally killed 20 elementary school children in a town just two hours away from our own campus, President Christina Paxson P’19 decided to sponsor a series of forums on school shootings. She urged the Janus Forum to sponsor a talk on gun violence and signed a letter with the Association of American Universities that urged President Obama to act on gun control.</p>
<p class="p2">Five years later, our country is seeing some of the bloodiest acts of terror in its history. On Oct. 1, a gunman released fire on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas, killing 58 and injuring more than 500 in the deadliest mass shooting by an individual that the United States has ever seen. And Sunday, a shooting at a church outside of San Antonio, Texas left 25 people dead and more injured.</p>
<p class="p2">The Columbine shooting that rocked the country in 1999 is no longer one of the ten deadliest shootings the United States has seen. Three of the worst five have occurred in the past year. But the dialogue surrounding campus has not reflected the continual impact of these horrific events.</p>
<p class="p2">Administrators are not talking to us about it. Students aren’t talking about what’s happening — or, at least, not publicly. Is it because these tragedies occur so frequently that we’ve become numb to them? Because they don’t feel close enough for us to feel their impacts? Or because these isolated incidents don’t give us a general impression of larger systemic issues in how our country deals with gun control?</p>
<p class="p2">We are bothered by this radio silence — and we know other students are, too.</p>
<p class="p2">With all the challenges today’s political climate presents, we urge the University and its students not to allow these events to escape our periphery.</p>
<p class="p2">There are many steps that we can take to combat the isolation that students feel when they internalize their reactions. We ask the University and the groups it sponsors to host forums where students can have a chance to speak to both on the personal impact of gun violence and its greater implications for the country. We hope the University will create spaces to further activism for students who want to work to affect gun policies on regional or local scales. And, at The Herald, we will continue to offer the forum that exists in these pages for you to project your voice on these issues.</p>
<p class="p2">After the attack on Tuesday, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a speech, “We’ll respond as we always do. We will be undeterred.” As students, we should be undeterred — but we should be bothered. In the face of the mass shooting in Texas Sunday, let us not respond in the same way we have in this past month — let us carve out spaces to talk about what’s bothering us. Tragedy cannot be ignored.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Undergraduate Council of Students recently decided to increase the student activities fee from $274 to $295. In the meeting, the leaders of the Undergraduate Finance Board recommended the increase, attributing the board’s $130,000 deficit to an influx of clubs requesting categorization that were previously funded by some academic departments. With this information, a question remains: Why is the University adding a financial burden to students by forcing us to pay for groups that were previously funded by our tuition?</p>
<p class="p1">According to the resolution, the group must now fund seven Category II and three groups “previously funded by the Department of Engineering and service groups funded by the Swearer Center.” It’s unclear why UFB is taking on Departmental Undergraduate Groups when other documents, such as the DUG leader tip sheet, indicate that DUGS fall under the jurisdiction of academic departments, the Dean of the College and the Curricular Resource Center. Each DUG is eligible for up to $1,000 in annual funding. According to the sheet, last updated on Sept. 22, 2017, the Office of the Dean of the College will match up to $500 provided by an academic department. If this has changed recently, the University certainly hasn’t let us know anything.</p>
<p class="p1">As for any groups formerly funded by the Swearer Center now in need of funding — what are they? BRYTE, which was previously funded by the Swearer Center, is now housed under the Alpert Medical School. But that’s all we’ve learned about.</p>
<p class="p1">If the University has decided not to fund certain groups, then we should be made aware of that, as those costs will now need to be supplemented by our student activities fee. We encourage the Department of Engineering to explain why it is no longer funding certain groups. And we ask the Swearer Center to be clear about how funding for its groups has changed, as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Along with the University, UFB — while it is trying — is not yet transparent enough. It did not name the seven groups that they are now forced to fund, although that would help us to understand the situation they have seemingly been forced into by the University. This problem stems from a general lack of transparency coming from UFB about how they allocate funds. If we are going to be paying the possible $295 dollars for the student activities fee, we’d like to know where our money is going.</p>

		<title>Anderson ’20 lifts Bears over LIU Brooklyn with career day</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The men’s basketball team stayed active during its holiday break, returning home to face Long Island University at Brooklyn Saturday at the Pizzitola Sports Center. After a midweek road loss to Stony Brook University, the Bears used a second half push to defend their home court, ousting the Blackbirds in a high-scoring affair, 94-86. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brandon Anderson ’20 led Brown (4-2, 0-0 Ivy) with a career-high 24 points. Coming off the bench, Anderson made his impact felt by getting to the free-throw line, where he sunk 14 of 16 attempts. He is averaging 20.2 points per game early in the season, second in the Ivy League behind only Cornell’s Matt Morgan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Bears jumped out to an early 20-9 lead, taking advantage of sloppy play by the Blackbirds (2-5) which resulted in six turnovers in the first nine minutes of play. Trailing by as many as 12 points with five minutes to play in the half, LIU used hot shooting to climb back into the game. While LIU shot 6-of-12 from three in the first 20 minutes, including a 3-for-3 effort from guard Julian Batts, Brown hit just one of eight attempts early on. Raiquan Clark also gave the Bears trouble in the first half, scoring 16 points of his 26 total in the first 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Batts hit a three-pointer to give the Blackbirds a three-point lead, its biggest of the half, with under a minute to play. But a pair of free throws by Desmond Cambridge ’21 pulled Brown within a point heading into the locker room, as the score stood at 48-47. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">After Travis Fuller ’19 put in a layup off an assist from Cambridge, Brown took a 51-50 lead just over a minute into the second half. The Bears wouldn’t give back the lead for the rest of the contest. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The hot outside shooting that brought the Blackbirds back into the game cooled off markedly after the break, as the team shot just 14 percent from three and 42 percent from the field in the second half. For Brown, a balanced offensive effort helped the team to an identical 47-point output in the second half, which proved to be more than enough to close out the cold-shooting Blackbirds.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Starters Obi Okolie ’19, Zach Hunsaker ’20 and Cambridge each contributed seven points to go along with 11 in the half from Anderson. In total, Brown shot 53 percent from the field in the half and 56 percent overall in the contest. Fuller hauled in six second-half boards on his way to his first double-double of the season with 14 points and 11 total rebounds. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Head Coach Mike Martin ’04 continued Brown’s early trend of spreading playing time around to younger players, as Tamenang Choh ’21 made his first career start alongside his classmate Cambridge, while Matt DeWolf<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>’21 logged 15 minutes off the bench.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brown followed up Saturday’s win with an 81-67 road triumph over in-state rival Bryant University Sunday night. The team will continue non-conference play with another Ocean State foe, travling to Kingston to face URI Tuesday night. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Editorial: GOP tax plan sets up roadblocks to graduate programs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When the House, with 227 Republican votes, passed its tax bill, it vowed to cut $1.5 trillion in taxes, with many of those cuts going to the richest in our country. But the bill will increase taxes for those who can afford it the least — among those, graduate students. As The Herald reported Friday, if the House bill passes through the Senate, graduate students’ waived tuition of $50,000 per year will be treated as income. That means they will be taxed in the $80,000 tax bracket rather than on the $30,000 stipends they actually receive. As the average tax per student under the new plan is estimated to exceed $16,500, graduate students would be left with only $13,000 to live on. And after paying 12-months of rent, estimated at around $600 a month in Providence for a place near campus, they’d be left with less than $6,000 a year.</p>
<p class="p1">Many graduate students can already barely support themselves. Low- and middle-income students struggle to enroll in graduate programs. PhD programs are often expensive — this bill would allow only the wealthiest students to pursue PhDs. That takes away from the diversity critical to a healthy academic environment. Some students who are currently pursuing PhDs may even have to end their programs, resulting in wasted money and time.</p>
<p class="p1">Without graduate students, the research arms of America’s top universities would be decimated. Researchers would leave for international institutions, putting a big hole in much of the groundbreaking research that comes out of America and leaving us less competitive with other countries. Our country prides itself on having some of the brightest minds in the world — let’s not give them a reason to leave.</p>
<p class="p1">Is this worth the $344 million dollars a year that this tax would bring in, especially when the plan would add over $1 trillion to our debt in the next 10 years? This bill would affect the 145,000 graduate students who currently qualify for tuition reduction — let’s give them a chance to stay in school.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students accepted early decision — including a few members of the 127th Editorial Board — love to complain about not getting invited to Brown’s admitted students’ event: A Day on College Hill. They groan about how they never got to join in on the late night arch sings, sigh longingly when someone mentions the free food and bear a hole in their hearts where others carry the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/04/23/adoch-gives-prospective-students-taste-campus/">ADOCH</a> address by the dean of admission. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But then again, many of them only sent in one application, had to wait a month in agony for a decision instead of four and got sick of the arch sings that were so special at ADOCH by the sixth week of school anyways (the third if they were living in Wayland).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The University has taken pity on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1877074059229929&amp;set=gm.1586980618009087&amp;type=3">memes</a> and started inviting early decision admits to ADOCH, which will now take place over two different two-day periods. But while the invitation may sweeten the saltiness some early decision admits still feel, the move ultimately holds little meaning for those<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to whom it matters the most and may spend resources that would better be diverted toward other necessities, like financial aid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The early decision admits will not be able to receive on-campus housing, which will be saved for regular decision admits. That means that ED admits will either be forced to leave after a day or find their own accommodations in hotels. This is just another iteration of the exclusionary elements of “CUBS Day” — what used to be a vastly underwhelming day for admitted early decision students that lasted about three hours and did not include any housing accommodations. A lack of housing meant the event was predominantly attended by wealthy students or those who lived nearby. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact that early decision students would not receive housing entirely undercuts the Admission Office’s goals of making <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/19/adoch-welcomes-pre-frosh-campus/">ADOCH</a> more equitable. We applaud the admission office for committing more money to travel grants so that low- and middle- income students can visit Brown, but what good is a student travelling out to Providence if they would just have to pay for a place to stay when out here? And perhaps the admission office isn’t deciding to fund travel grants for early decision applicants. In that case, you have mostly wealthy early decision admits coming out for ADOCH — exactly the problem they were trying to stymy by doubling their travel budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to Dean of Admission Logan Powell, the University is inviting early decision admits so their enthusiasm about Brown may spread to regular decision admits who are choosing between schools. But this seems largely unnecessary as current Brown students already spread their excitement to ADOCH <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/04/23/adoch-gives-prospective-students-taste-campus/">attendees</a> by hosting events for them and housing them in their dorms. And the chance that early decision admits will be making a convincing case to attend Brown — especially when they are still denied the full ADOCH experience — is small. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, early decision students really don’t need to be convinced to come to Brown: The fact that they applied to this school knowing that they would have to attend makes that clear. Ultimately, Brown would be wasting funds that could be better spent on other areas like financial aid. </span></p>

		<title>Editorial: Ensuring transparency in BrownTogether</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/16/editorial-ensuring-transparency-browntogether/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Jan. 4, the University <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/05/browntogether-campaign-eclipses-midpoint-funding-goal/">announced</a> that it had successfully raised more than half of its BrownTogether fundraising goal, collecting over $1.64 billion since the campaign’s official launch in fall 2015. The previous month, the University also <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/12/07/university-reaches-30-million-fundraising-goal-brown-promise/">announced</a> that it had reached its $30 million target to fund “The Brown Promise: The Future of Financial Aid at Brown,” an initiative to eliminate all loans from students’ financial aid packages. While we commend the University for the extraordinary progress it has made toward these ambitious goals, important questions about the initiative to eliminate loans and the specific allocations of BrownTogether funding remain unanswered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The most publicized part of the BrownTogether fundraising effort is, without a doubt, the Brown Promise. On paper, this subsidiary campaign heralds a new financial future for Brown — one that makes the University a more attractive destination for prospective applicants, eliminates a considerable source of anxiety for current students and promotes a more inclusive learning environment for the entire community.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In practice, however, the sustained implementation of a loan-free financial aid policy will likely prove far more complicated. Though Brown Promise’s initial target has been met and the financial aid packages for incoming and current students will not include loans in the next school year, the funds raised thus far only cover the initial costs of the program. Because the initiative costs $4.5 million annually, the University needs to raise an additional <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/12/07/university-reaches-30-million-fundraising-goal-brown-promise/">$90 million</a> to make the initiative sustainable in the long term.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even if these additional funds are procured, it is not clear whether the initiative to eliminate loans will actually relieve students of the burden of loans. As the experiences of peer universities that have moved to eliminate loans <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/29/peer-schools-contextualize-brown-promise/">indicate</a>, administrative commitments to loan-free financial aid can still leave aid-receiving students with sizeable loan obligations. In 2008, for example, Yale came under criticism after implementing its no-loan policy because some students still had to take out loans to meet student income contributions — a component of financial aid packages that students themselves are expected to pay. Penn, which also eliminated loans in 2008, faced similar criticism and ended up modifying its policy from “no-loan” to “grant-based,” making loans available on a case-by-case basis. In light of this disappointing track record, the University must provide clarity as to how it plans to avoid stumbling into the same pitfalls encountered by peer institutions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">More broadly, the University has not yet provided a transparent breakdown of how the funds raised under the BrownTogether umbrella will finance all the president’s initiatives. The whole campaign consists of four major categories: the “Annual Fund,” “Education and Research,” “Campus and Community” and “Investing in People.” Of these, “Investing in People” is the largest campaign bucket, consisting of a third of the $3 billion total campaign — but it has also made the least progress toward its fundraising goal, with only $400 million, or 36 percent, raised out of its $1.1 billion target. Though the University plans to emphasize “Investing in People” in the next stage of the campaign, we are concerned that certain initiatives funded by the BrownTogether campaign — including the hiring of historically underrepresented faculty, as proposed by the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan — still lack visibility. In particular, it is unclear what proportion of the $165 million set aside for the DIAP has been funded and how much money remains to be raised. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The project of making Brown a more inclusive, financially supportive institution is an urgent priority. But the University must better communicate to the community how it plans to resolve the challenges its fundraising efforts currently face. BrownTogether has the potential to reshape and elevate the Brown experience for generations to come. In fully and sustainably actualizing this progress, though, there is still a long way to go.</span></p>

<em><strong>Correction: This editorial previously described BrownPromise as a no-loans policy. Brown Promise, however, describes itself as an initiative to eliminate loans, not a no-loans policy. Brown’s initiative to eliminate loans promises that loans will not figure in undergraduate financial aid packages. It does not promise that students will not have to take out loans to attend university. The editorial has been corrected to reflect this nuance. The Herald regrets the error. </strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Feb. 20, the University announced plans to <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/20/u-changes-site-for-performing-arts-center/">change the proposed location</a> of its new performing arts center “to a smaller plot on The Walk between Angell and Olive streets, facing the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts.” The choice of the original site would have resulted in the demolition of four historic buildings that are central to campus life, including the beloved Urban Environmental Lab, a storied building that houses the environmental studies program, the Native American and Indigenous Studies at Brown initiative and a variety of student organizations. Following sustained criticism from students, faculty members and Providence city residents, the University has wisely decided to shift course.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We support the University’s decision to respond to community feedback and compromise on the performing arts center’s location. While efforts to enhance the spaces available to students and practitioners of the arts at Brown are certainly welcome, they should not be pursued at the expense of infrastructure with historical and educational significance to many members of the community. The revised plan successfully reconciles the need for new arts facilities with demands for the preservation of existing structures. The new location renders the proposed demolitions unnecessary and allows more of the structure to be built underground, a move that is expected to alleviate traffic congestion and parking pressures.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just as importantly, we applaud all the activists — on- and off-campus — who mobilized community action around issues of sustainability and historical preservation on College Hill, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/07/illick-frank-18-sharpe-18-dont-write-off-uel-just-yet/">initiated important conversations</a> about Brown’s footprint in the wider community and proved that committed individuals can hold powerful entities accountable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> Resistance to the original construction plans emerged almost immediately after they were first unveiled. Last year, students seeking to preserve the UEL <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/26/planned-uel-demolition-invokes-criticism/">circulated a petition</a> that garnered over 300 signatures and organized outreach efforts on social media. And according to last spring’s undergraduate Herald poll, <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/17/39-8-percent-students-oppose-building-performing-arts-center-uel-site-s/">39.8 percent of students opposed</a> the site of the new performing arts center, while only 26 percent supported it. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Professors, too, were vocal about the costs of the UEL’s removal to environmental education at Brown. <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/16/steinman-19-rescue-urban-environmental-lab/">Originally a carriage house</a> when it was erected in 1885, the UEL was later <a href="http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/2070/40/">renovated by students in 1979</a> to “showcase the maximum of what can be done in an urban environment.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/06/arts-center-met-controversy-providence-locals/">Public opposition</a> from Providence locals fully crystallized in the last few months. Earlier this year, the University asked the Providence City Plan Commission to delay a vote on the construction from Jan. 16 to March 20. Though Russell Carey ’91 MA’06, the University’s executive vice president for planning and policy, did not guarantee any changes to the original plans, he did acknowledge that “it was clear that the proposal was not ready to be acted on at (the Jan. 16) meeting.” Representatives of the Providence Preservation Society — which placed the four buildings at risk of demolition on its “2018 Most Endangered Properties List” — argued that the new performing arts center could be built in other places without necessitating the elimination of historic buildings. Comments solicited from the public also revealed concerns about the original site’s effects on parking and traffic.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Taken together, the University’s eventual accommodation of community input and activists’ steadfast defense of community institutions underscore the enduring power of grassroots movements. A few weeks ago, it would have been easy to write off the UEL as a lost cause — a building irreversibly condemned to erasure. Yet, in sustaining their resistance despite the odds, today’s community activists once again have done an invaluable service to the University, advancing a legacy of informed, inclusive action that will enrich life at Brown and protect the historical vibrancy of College Hill for generations to come. As one student told The Herald last week, “This change is really about having a community survive and history maintained.”</p>

		<title>Editorial: University&#039;s response to racist flyers came too late</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Feb. 3, a series of appalling <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/22/university-releases-statement-regarding-racist-flyers/">racist and anti-black pamphlets were found</a> around the University and surrounding neighborhoods. These flyers — which were allegedly distributed by the white supremacist group Vanguard America, a primary organizer of the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August, according to <a href="http://bluestockingsmag.com/2018/02/14/joint-statement-from-black-students-at-brown/">a statement published by bluestockings magazine</a> — contained harmful language and hateful stereotypes that are unacceptable in all contexts, and have no place in this campus, community and country.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In response, student leaders and local activists mobilized in support of affected community members, organizing two press conferences to condemn the disgusting flyers. Mayor Jorge Elorza and other local leaders also attended the gatherings and spoke in solidarity. The combined efforts of students, local residents, city leaders and organizations like the Brown and Providence chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People were a much-needed show of unity in an otherwise dark moment. Yet, in the midst of this grassroots resistance, the University stood silent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Feb. 14, a group of concerned black students published <a href="http://bluestockingsmag.com/2018/02/14/joint-statement-from-black-students-at-brown/">a statement in bluestockings magazine</a> denouncing the pamphlets — and the University’s inaction. A week later, the University sent out a message on Today@Brown Feb. 21 condemning the pamphlets and reiterating its support for students. President Christina Paxson P’19 wrote, “Not only are such acts deeply harmful to the individuals and communities they target, they conflict with the very values that define our community at Brown. No person — whether a Brown student going to the library, a student from Hope High School walking to school or a Providence resident on the way to work — should be subject to flyers that have the intent to dehumanize and intimidate.” We wholeheartedly agree with these sentiments — but cannot help but question why on earth it took so long for the University to make such a statement. It is not enough that the flyers “generated a great deal of discussion among administrative leaders across the University.” Such rampant bigotry demands an immediate, unequivocal and public denunciation, which Paxson conceded in her message, writing “denouncing the flyer would have been an opportunity to reaffirm to members of our community who identify as black that Brown is committed to their wellbeing.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After all, in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-hatecrime-fbi/u-s-hate-crimes-rise-for-second-straight-year-fbi-idUSKBN1DD2BA">a political moment when hate and intolerance are on the rise</a>, it is pivotal that powerful institutions like Brown stand in support of community members of marginalized backgrounds. The University cannot hope to make strides in diversity and inclusion unless it can convince underrepresented individuals that they are safe and valued on campus. And this month, when the administration had the opportunity to do just that, it fell short.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her letter, Paxson wrote that, “the best way for us to combat the ugly racism of the flyers spread across Providence is to redouble our efforts to do what we as a university community do best: educate ourselves and others about past and continued inequities, take principled stands against racism and bigotry and continue to move forward on our plans to build a more diverse and inclusive community.” It is unfortunate that the University took nearly three weeks — and a sharp rebuke from black student leaders — to take even the most basic of “principled stands.” </span></p>

		<title>Editorial: University should not suspend MAT program’s elementary track</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On Jan. 22, the School of Professional Studies decided to place the Master of Arts in <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/education/news/2018-01/elementary-education-track-admissions-update-mat-applicants">Teaching</a> program under review and to suspend the elementary track of the program for the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/26/cancellation-mat-track-met-frustration/">2018-19</a> academic year. Dean of the School of Professional Studies and Vice Chair of the Department of Education Karen Sibley MAT’81 P’07 P’12 said she is unsure whether the program will return. This news is deeply worrisome. The suspension and possible cancellation of the elementary track — a program that sets Brown apart from peer schools — reflects the administration’s faulty logic and undemocratic decision-making, and will inflict long-term harm on both the University and the greater Providence community.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The elementary track is a rigorous, yearlong program that combines graduate-level courses and actual, full-day teaching experiences in local schools. Suspending the program would increase student-teacher ratios across Rhode Island, imperil the growth of the program’s network of alums and eliminate meaningful educational opportunities for elementary school students. For example, the elementary track’s suspension effectively shuts down SummerPrep — a free supplemental summer program established by the elementary track and the Community Preparatory School — at the expense of numerous Providence students. The University did not bother to communicate in advance its plans to suspend the elementary track to the Community Preparatory School. The University’s lack of transparency regarding its decision-making and disregard for the impact the suspension will have on the community have been particularly troubling.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/27/letter-mat-program-article-not-capture-intention/">In a letter</a> to The Herald, Provost Richard Locke P’18 clarified the University’s rationale for the review and suspension, writing, “We want to ensure that we are preparing teachers with the knowledge and skills to understand social contexts and how they impact students, meet the needs of diverse learners and promote greater equity in our schools.” But how can the University rationally hope to “continue to make a difference in classrooms in our city, state and nation,” as Locke says, without preparing a capable cohort of elementary school educators? Indeed, the elementary track — which, according to alums, focuses on issues of social justice and equality — already achieves many of the administration’s purported objectives.</p>
<p class="p2">Further, the University failed to respond constructively to the feedback of MAT program participants and reaffirm the value of elementary-level education. In the fall, MAT students were asked to provide feedback about the program, and many gave constructive criticism. But none of them knew that the program’s very existence was in jeopardy. Notably, the University has not suspended the secondary track of the MAT, which is also under administrative review, sending the message to alums and current students of the elementary track that their work matters less. “It feels like a slap in the face to eliminate elementary and only keep secondary, as if to say that Brown is ‘too prestigious’ to train elementary school educators,” said Ana Lopez ’10 MAT’11, third-grade teacher at the Oyster-Adams Bilingual School in Washington, D.C. “Quite frankly, I thought we were better than that.”</p>
<p class="p2">At the end of the day, the erasure of the elementary track will also inflict great harm on the University’s appeal as a go-to destination for elementary-level teaching. Indeed, the type of elementary MAT program offered by Brown is not available at its peer schools. <a href="https://gsas.yale.edu/academics/departments-programs">Yale</a>, <a href="https://gradschool.princeton.edu/node/4371">Princeton</a> and <a href="https://graduate.dartmouth.edu/academics/programs">Dartmouth</a> have no master’s programs for education. While <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/masters/programs">Harvard</a>, <a href="https://gradschool.cornell.edu/academics/fields-of-study/field/education">Cornell</a> and <a href="http://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics#by-division">Penn</a> do have graduate education programs, they do not have any geared toward elementary school teachers. Columbia, the only other Ivy League university with a program specifically tailored to elementary education, does not have a separate immersive component like Brown’s MAT, and their program is longer than a year. Brown stands alone in its exclusive combination of classes and elementary school teaching experience. “If you talk to any alum, they will tell you that this is the best teacher education program in the country,” said Margot Miller MAT’11. It would be unfortunate — and a grave dereliction of responsibility to its surrounding community — for the University to allow this program to end.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">At 10 a.m. this morning, students, staff members and community residents will gather on the Main Green to participate in the </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/355928904815201/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National School Walkout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against gun violence. In some schools, the national walkout, organized by </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/11/us/national-school-walkout-march-14/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the youth branch of the Women’s March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will last for 17 minutes — </span><a href="http://time.com/5195960/national-school-walkout-march-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one minute for each</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the people killed in the deadly school shooting that took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, exactly a month ago. This nationwide demonstration is one of the most high-profile acts of resistance against gun violence in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting. It is also a reflection of the grassroots, youth-led movement that has emerged in recent weeks in support of gun safety — a movement we hope will bring about lasting change.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/the-gun-control-debate-after-parkland" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fallout from the Parkland shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes clear, it is long past time to take meaningful action on the United States’ epidemic of gun violence. Most Americans seem to agree: A recent poll from </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/28/gun-control-polling-parkland-430099" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">POLITICO/Morning Consult</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that 60 percent of registered voters support banning firearms from schools and colleges, 68 percent support banning assault-style weapons and 88 percent support background checks. Yet, despite the public’s overwhelming support for gun safety rules, our institutions — time after time, massacre after massacre — have failed to deliver badly-needed reform. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated with this legislative inertia, young people have begun to mobilize and demand change themselves, at every level of government. In Florida, survivors of the Parkland shooting have advocated courageously for common-sense gun reform, defying the insulting ramblings of conspiracy theorists, kick-starting the </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-survivors-of-parkland-began-the-never-again-movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#NeverAgain movement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/us/florida-gun-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushing the state legislature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pass an initial round of restrictions on firearms — an unprecedented move in a Republican stronghold. In Washington, D.C., student organizers have planned a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/march-for-our-lives-gun-control-rally-bumped-from-mall-by-talent-show/2018/03/01/ad8c7268-1cc6-11e8-9496-c89dc446c2d3_story.html?utm_term=.6a44a6dc6cf3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March for Our Lives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> March 24, which could draw up to 500,000 attendees to the nation’s capital. And here, in Rhode Island, young people have taken their concerns about gun violence directly to their elected representatives. As one ninth-grader from Classical High School warned </span><a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/02/27/community-rallies-assault-weapons-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at a Feb. 27 rally at the State House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People say we’re too young to know what we’re talking about, but I’m a young adult who has seen these shootings over and over and over again. ... Don’t let us be the next Parkland, the next Sandy Hook, the next Columbine.” Later today, at 12:45 p.m., students at Providence schools have organized their own walkout to demand an end to gun violence.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brown community, too, has united around the issue of gun safety. Not only have students organized this morning’s walkout, but hundreds more have signaled that they plan to attend. And, by all indications, the University is taking this activism seriously. President Christina Paxson P’19 is scheduled to speak at the walkout, and just a few weeks ago, the Office of Admission </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/brownadmission/posts/10156326529334802" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prospective applicants to Brown, writing, “You can be assured that peaceful, responsible protests against gun violence will not negatively impact decisions on admission to Brown.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should all be deeply proud of the initiative taken by the student body and </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/02/24/speak-your-truth-in-wake-of-parkland-colleges-tell-students-protests-wont-hurt-their-chance-of-admission/?utm_term=.0b184b2ee9a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University administrators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enable fresh, impassioned action against the scourge of gun violence in the United States. But we cannot afford to let this momentum dissipate; we cannot afford to forget the lives lost or the families devastated until the next preventable, gun-related tragedy comes around. In this watershed moment, it is up to ordinary people — students, activists, community members and concerned citizens — to keep organizing, keep engaging in tough conversations and keep demanding that elected officials enact real, sensible reform. We hope that today’s walkout on the Main Green is the first step in that process.</span>

		<title>Editorial: Go forward with the disability identity center</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/15/editorial-go-forward-disability-identity-center/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Feb. 21, The Herald reported that a collective of Brown students and activists had proposed to University administrators the creation of a student-led disability identity and cultural center. The proposed center — which aims to fill a void in campus life and establish a robust sense of community for students with disabilities — will feature study rooms free of distractions, accessible group meeting rooms and open hours for peer mental health advocates. According to student activists, University administrators have responded positively to the proposal, though logistical details and a timeline for the center’s establishment have yet to be cemented. We wholeheartedly support the students and organizations behind the push for a disability identity center, and hope that the proposal engenders constructive conversations about the experience and well-being of students with disabilities at Brown. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While official resources — like Student and Employee Accessibility Services and Counseling and Psychological Services — do exist to accommodate students’ needs, there is a notable dearth of student-driven community programming on campus for students with disabilities. “There’s a sense of not belonging, this feeling of ‘I’m not getting the support I need,’” Matthew Flathers ’19 told The Herald. “A lot of people feel really isolated on campus.” A disability identity center — initiated, managed and sustained by students — would go a long way toward curtailing the sense of isolation experienced by students with disabilities and developing the peer support structure available to them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Further, a disability identity center is a natural extension of the University’s recent efforts to address student concerns about accessibility. In keeping with the objectives laid out in its Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, the University — along with individual academic and administrative departments, which have created their own DIAPs — has taken significant steps to enhance the accessibility of its physical and technological infrastructure. These steps — which include the ongoing renovation of Wilson Hall and the creation of a digital arm of the Campus Access Advisory Committee — would benefit tremendously from a grassroots, student-driven center that effectively channels student input and addresses student needs. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The proposed disability identity center is, ultimately, a fitting culmination of years of student activism around issues of inclusivity. And, while the proposed disability identity center is still in the ideation stage, we value the opportunity to think deeply about Brown’s commitment to accessibility, the needs of our fellow students and the ways in which the University can more fully actualize its values. After all, students of all marginalized identities should be able to access the resources and support they need in a space they can call their own. We look forward to seeing plans for and discussions about the proposed disability identity center mature and develop further.</span></p>

		<title>Editorial: In support of #FullDisclosure</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/21/editorial-support-fulldisclosure/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Feb. 14, the #FullDisclosure <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/14/students-scrutinize-legacy-based-admission/">campaign</a> — a coalition of student organizations from 12 colleges across the country that has been significantly influenced by former Undergraduate Council of Students president Viet Nguyen ’17 — issued a letter asking universities to release their internal data on policies regarding legacy status consideration. In its letter, the campaign also suggested that universities create committees of administrators, students and alums to critically evaluate the influence of legacy status in admission. We commend the national campaign’s efforts to bring increased transparency to the admission process with respect to legacy applicants and hope that the University moves to enact its recommendations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A close examination of legacy status consideration is necessary. A 2004 study found that legacy status provides the same boost as an additional 160 points on the SAT, providing a specific group of applicants with a substantial advantage in the admission process. As a 2014 Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/04/15/editorial-abolish-legacy-status-admission-consideration/">editorial</a> argued, legacy status consideration has historically been used to exclude students of underrepresented backgrounds from higher education. Today, many students assert that the policy discriminates against those whose parents may not have had the opportunity to attend an elite university.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">University administrators claim that they consider legacy status only as a tie-breaking attribute — of equivalent value to, for example, athletic or artistic achievement — and that they do not maintain explicit policies about legacy status consideration. But without actual data, it is difficult to assess the validity of these claims or reach informed conclusions about the effect that legacy status has in the admission process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a March 5 <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/05/powell-dispelling-legacy-myths-help-focus-access/">op-ed</a> published in The Herald, Dean of Admission Logan Powell defended the practice of legacy status consideration, arguing that legacy students “grew up immersed in the values of Brown,” serve as mentors for their peers, give back with internship opportunities on BrownConnect and support Brown financially. But these justifications for the use of legacy status in admission are problematic in their own right. First, applicants’ future giving should not be considered, even slightly, in the admission process. Second, there is little evidence to suggest that eliminating legacy preferences will reduce donations from alums in the short term. And thirdly, that the University would want to admit only students with extensive exposure to the “values of Brown” seems to undermine its purported commitments to diversity and the full inclusion of students from all communities — including those that are different from Brown. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The recommendations set forth by the #FullDisclosure campaign can dispel misinformation about legacy status consideration, clarify the terms of the debate and democratize the conversation to include more members of the Brown community. Notably, the campaign is not advocating for the immediate and unequivocal termination of legacy status consideration. Rather, its proponents simply seek a transparent and publicly accountable analysis of a potentially discriminatory admission policy. If its admission policies are fair, then the University has good reason to publish its data. In any case, the University should not ground its decision to prefer a certain group of applicants in a highly selective admission process in factually dubious claims.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Students have already taken major steps to realize the vision of #FullDisclosure here at Brown. On March 14, UCS approved a proposal to hold a referendum on the policy reforms recommended by the #FullDisclosure campaign. We urge students, both those for and against the use of legacy status in admission, to vote in support of the reforms. While the non-binding referendum cannot directly force the University to release internal information about admissions — should the results be in favor of the #FullDisclosure campaign — a campus-wide, transparent re-evaluation of legacy status consideration will empower all students with the facts they need to make educated judgments about Brown admission.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the evening of March 22, Elections Board Chairs Katherine Barry ’19 and Kathryn Stack ’19 announced the results of the 2018 elections for the Undergraduate Council of Students and the Undergraduate Finance Board. Shanz</span><span class="s2">é</span><span class="s1"> Tahir ’19 won the UCS presidency, with 82 percent of the vote; Lisa Schold ’19 accrued 72 percent to secure the UFB chairpersonship; and 81 percent of voters supported the #FullDisclosure moment. In some ways, this year’s elections — which saw 34 percent turnout for UCS presidential elections and only two uncontested races across both UCS and UFB — were vastly more competitive than last year’s, when candidates for <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/03/24/unopposed-steele-18-ucs-president-akasaka-18-wins-ufb-chair/">five positions</a> went unchallenged and the voter turnout rate for the whole election barely exceeded 20 percent. Still, while we appreciate the progress made, heartily congratulate the victors and believe in their capacity to enact positive change, we recognize that there is work to be done before the elections process — and student government at Brown, more broadly — becomes fully representative of and accountable to the student body. In particular, we express profound disappointment with the low voter turnout rate for UFB races, the hurried pace of the elections and the moderation of the candidate debate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A high voter turnout is important to ensure the representativeness of a democratic system, as a substantial body of research has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/why-non-voters-matter/405250/">confirmed</a>. Unfortunately, given a voter turnout rate of 24 percent in the 2018 UFB chairperson elections — just four percentage points higher than last year’s turnout — student government at Brown is far from fully representative. (This year’s UFB vice chairperson election went uncontested.) Though the blame for low voter turnout cannot be placed exclusively on the shoulders of officeholders — the onus is also on students to actually vote — it is certainly elected leaders’ responsibility to reach out to the community, encourage students to vote and generate enthusiasm around student government at Brown. Not only does a low voter turnout rate undermine the perceived legitimacy of the elected students, it also reflects the sad reality that a considerable proportion of the student body feels unmotivated to vote and uninterested in student government, an endeavor that continues to have <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/01/29/student-publications-pushed-reduce-printing-budgets/">significant influence</a> on the everyday lives of students. </span></p>
<p class="p1">One possible way to increase voter turnout in the future might be to extend the timeframe of the elections. According to <a href="http://www.brownucs.org/elections2018/">UCS rules</a>, candidates were only permitted to declare their candidacies this election cycle after a meeting on March 14. The candidate debate occurred just four days later, on March 18; the voting period ended four days after that, on March 22. In total, the election lasted about eight days — giving candidates and voters a little over a week to publicize their agendas and assess those agendas, respectively. This is not nearly enough time for the community to engage in sustained, enriching discussions about the direction of Brown, campus life and expectations of student government.</p>
<p class="p1">Another concerning part of the elections process was the fact that the sitting UCS president, Chelse-Amoy Steele ’18, and the sitting UFB chairperson, Yuzuka Akasaka ’18, served as two of the moderators of the candidate debate. In a statement published in the comment section of the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/03/18/ucs-ufb-candidates-engage-public-debate/">The Herald</a>, Steele and Akasaka wrote, “All questions for candidates were drafted by (us) with attention to their platforms. As the representatives of the two organizations participating in the debate and the authors of the questions, our presence as moderators was required.”</p>
<p class="p1">While certainly well-intentioned, the justification issued by Steele and Akasaka does not take into account the role of media as watchdogs in a self-governing society. Imagine, for a moment, if a sitting president of the United States were to moderate a debate between two aspiring candidates, instead of a journalist. The conflict of interest inherent to such an arrangement — even the most magnanimous of presidents have an incentive to implicitly support the candidate most likely to preserve their legacy — seriously jeopardizes the very purpose of a candidate debate.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In any democratic system, public accountability is paramount, and all members of student government, current and aspiring, should be held accountable to the entire student body. A simple alternative is to ask members of student-led media organizations to moderate the debate and question the candidates, as has been done in the past. Though we understand concerns about extending moderating privileges to a single publication, a committee of student journalists — selected from a variety of organizations and mediums — could place candidates under more objective scrutiny. </span></p>
<p class="p1">At the end of the day, we draw attention to these electoral shortcomings because we firmly believe that student government is a serious and worthwhile exercise, with important implications for student life, administrative policy and the long-term evolution of the University. The president of UCS, for example, has the power to facilitate comprehensive reforms and set the cultural tone of campus, while UFB can disperse and withhold funds essential to the operation of most student organizations. Student government, in the larger scheme of things, also has immense utility as an educational experience, offering students crucial instruction in the practice of self-determination and deliberative democracy — endeavors that have taken on added significance in the current political climate. In light of these truths, we hope that the newest slate of UCS and UFB leaders work to enhance the elections process going forward.</p>

		<title>Editorial: Reforming the First Readings program</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/12/editorial-reforming-the-first-readings-program/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since 2007, the University has requested all its incoming first-year students to read a single book (or, in one case, watch a movie) and then discuss it in small seminars during first-year orientation. The First Readings program, as it is called, was designed to create a “shared intellectual endeavor for all beginning Brown students” and to introduce them to the “pleasures and rigors of undergraduate academic life,” according to the First Readings program’s webpage. Past selections have included the film “Oil and Water,” “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness” by Michelle Alexander and “My Beloved World” by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Last month, the University announced in a Today@Brown message that the First Readings text for the incoming class of 2022 is “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City,” by Matthew Desmond. In “Evicted,” the winner of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction, Desmond tells the story of eight families who were evicted from their homes in Milwaukee. In doing so, he offers insights into the realities of inequality, race and poverty in urban America. Selected after a lengthy deliberation process, “Evicted” — like the selections before it — has the potential to give first-years a solid opportunity to dive deeply into weighty subjects even before they get to campus and generate timely conversations about pressing issues that can unite the student body in shared reflection. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, the current structure of the First Readings program does not live up to this potential. As part of the assignment, first-years are tasked with going through the reading and writing short response papers before participating in informal seminars. But without guidance, these papers are generally perfunctory assignments that do not let students exercise their creativity or engage with the readings in innovative ways. Moreover, it is unrealistic to expect a single seminar discussion during orientation week to facilitate long-term reflections or acclimate students to academic life at Brown. After the seminar, the text is largely forgotten in the frenzy of the new semester; in fact, some of us may not even remember our First Readings assignments. Ultimately, the entire exercise feels like a compliance obligation rather than a source of meaningful dialogue.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Going forward, the University should consider reforming the First Readings program to make it a more engaging and sustained experience for first-years. To this end, it can learn from the programs operated by other institutions. Approximately 40 percent of American college orientations involve a shared reading, but several universities take the program further: Stanford, for example, assigned three hefty books, and then invited each of the authors to campus during orientation to share their views directly with students. Other schools host lecture series or events that offer different perspectives on the readings at hand. These are changes that Brown could well undertake. After all, when the University invited Justice Sotomayor to discuss “My Beloved World” in February, the talk added a new level of engagement to the First Readings initiative. Brown should continue in this vein to ensure that First Readings becomes more than just a one-off summer reading assignment.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We firmly believe that the First Readings program is a valuable staple of the orientation experience, and that a revitalized version can more effectively introduce students to the intellectual mission and culture of the University. First-year students stand to benefit from getting an early taste of college-level discussions and analysis. The program can also set the tone for the upcoming year, help forge bonds between students new to campus and generate productive conversations both in and out of the classroom. Unfortunately, as it currently stands, the First Readings program feels like a box that incoming students must mindlessly check off during orientation week. We hope that this changes in the years to come.</span></p>

		<title>Editorial: Thirsting for more water stations</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/16/thirsting-water-stations/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During orientation week, all first-year students are given a welcome package that includes a reusable water bottle. This policy can be traced back to 2008, when the student organization Beyond the Bottle pushed the University to scale back its use of disposable water bottles. Today, Brown Dining Services does not sell plastic bottles of water, and students are encouraged to fill and drink from reusable <a href="https://www.brown.edu/initiatives/brown-is-green/initiatives/water/beyond-bottle">water bottles</a>. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done, as many buildings do not have water bottle filling stations in close proximity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Several buildings across campus lack water bottle filling stations, including the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs and the Center for Information Technology. More egregiously, none of the three first-year dorms in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/10/ucs-aims-increase-filtered-water-access/">Keeney Quadrangle</a> — which houses 600 students and constitutes the “largest self-contained residential unit on campus” — contain even a single water bottle filling station. This means that students working and residing in these buildings need to venture elsewhere to fill their bottles or resort to buying bottled water or filters. This poses unnecessary challenges for students and community members as they try to stay hydrated.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It goes without saying that all students should have easy access to safe drinking water. Providence, however, has a <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171222/providence-water-elevated-levels-of-lead-found-in-some-drinking-water">track record</a> of elevated lead levels in drinking water. At higher risk of lead contamination are buildings built before 1947 — including many of the University’s residence halls. Students have previously complained about visibly discolored water in halls such as the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/04/07/water-grad-centers-safe-drink-facilities-says/">Graduate Center</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/04/reslife-to-renovate-perkins-barbour/">Perkins Hall</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2">A number of students interviewed by The Herald have voiced doubts about the quality of the drinking water from kitchen and bathroom sinks. An Undergraduate Council of Students survey from earlier this year showed that a large majority of survey respondents ranked the importance of increasing access to water filling stations as “four or more on a scale of one to five,” with five designating the highest-priority issues. Though the sample size of this survey is small, it demonstrates at the very least that a significant number of students have been inconvenienced or troubled by the dearth of water stations. Of particular concern is the belief that tap water could contain lead: Though the University has tested samples of waters in each of the halls and found that they do not contain lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency’s action level, even trace amounts of lead could have potential consequences for students’ health and well-being.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In response to these concerns, the UCS campus life committee has recently submitted a proposal to the Department of Facilities Management to add 10 new water stations around campus. There is no timeline for the implementation of the initiative, and Facilities Management has not yet accepted or approved it. But, while there remains a lot of work to be done to enact the proposal, we are optimistic that these additional water stations will significantly bolster the University’s efforts to enhance accessibility, student wellness and campus sustainability. We hope that the administration takes students’ concerns about drinking water seriously and acts on them soon. After all, it is long past time that all residential buildings — and frankly, all buildings — at Brown are equipped with a reliable source of clean water.</span></p>

		<title>Editorial: Bring the Reproductive Health Care Act to a vote</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On April 10, hundreds of <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/11/community-members-voice-opinions-proposed-reproductive-health-bills/">community members gathered</a> at the Rhode Island State House for a House Judiciary Committee hearing, which featured the introduction of six bills governing reproductive rights in Rhode Island. Five of the bills proposed limitations on abortion access; the lone bill aimed at safeguarding abortions rights was the <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText18/HouseText18/H7340.pdf">Reproductive Health Care Act</a>, sponsored by Rep. Edith Ajello, D-Providence. Under the Act, the state cannot “restrict an individual person from preventing, commencing, continuing or terminating that individual’s pregnancy prior to fetal viability” or “restrict access to evidence-based, medically recognized methods of contraception or abortion or the provision of such (services).” The House Judiciary Committee elected to hold all six bills for “further study” after its hearing — including, regrettably, the Reproductive Health Care Act, effectively <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170219/political-scene-legislative-limbo-lives-on-in-ri-house">condemning</a> it to legislative oblivion.</p>
<p class="p2">In previous editorials, The Herald has vehemently opposed unwarranted restrictions on abortion — such as a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/03/19/editorial-war-on-women-arrives-in-rhode-island/">proposed 2012 bill</a> that would have compelled Rhode Island physicians to conduct an ultrasound on individuals seeking abortions and display to them the ultrasound’s images — and decried efforts to curtail women’s rights. Once again, we urge Rhode Island lawmakers to seriously consider the medical needs of all their constituents, extricate the Reproductive Health Care Act from the depths of committee bureaucracy and bring the urgently needed bill to the floor for a vote.</p>
<p class="p2">When it comes to reproductive justice, Rhode Island is notoriously retrogressive, more like states in the American South than its neighbors in the Northeast. In spite of the state’s progressive bona fides, access to reproductive health care is <a href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/state/rhode-island/">“severely restricted”</a> here, according to NARAL Pro-Choice America, a national organization that advocates for the right to choose. These restrictions are <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/03/11/rhode-island-fails-to-guarantee-abortion-access-affordability/">codified in state law</a> — a 1986 amendment to the state constitution explicitly refrains from granting or securing “any right relating to abortion or the funding thereof” — and diligently preserved by powerful, anti-choice Democrats in the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="p2">Most troublingly, the absence of any state legislation that protects access to critical reproductive services places abortion rights in continued peril. Currently, Roe v. Wade — the 1973 Supreme Court case that deemed abortions consistent with the constitution of the United States and rendered past abortion bans null — is the only<a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180206/abortion-rights-advocates-seek-to-guarantee-protections-in-ri-law"> statute preventing</a> the renewed enforcement of arcane abortion restrictions still on the books in Rhode Island. These include the requirement that women notify their spouses before receiving an abortion, the prohibition of insurance coverage for abortion procedures and the assertion that “human life commences at the instant of conception.”</p>
<p class="p2">Already, obtaining an abortion is prohibitively difficult in Rhode Island: As of 2014, only <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/factsheet/sfaa-ri.pdf">20 percent</a> of Rhode Island counties contained any abortion clinics, and over two-thirds of Rhode Island women lived outside these counties. But <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/02/15/r-lawmakers-reintroduce-law-protect-abortion-rights/">if Roe v. Wade is overturned</a> — a prospect at which President Trump has<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/trump-ill-appoint-supreme-court-justices-to-overturn-roe-v-wade-abortion-case.html"> expressed impish excitement</a> — Rhode Islanders could lose their right to choose in one immediate, devastating stroke. The Reproductive Health Care Act precludes such an eventuality and would preserve abortion rights in Rhode Island no matter what happens in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p class="p2">In the days leading up to the House Judiciary Committee’s hearing, a broad and diverse coalition of Rhode Islanders coalesced in favor of the Act. Gov. Gina Raimondo — who, until the hearing, had remained mostly silent on the issue of abortion — submitted a <a href="https://upriseri.com/news/health-care/reproductive-rights/2018-04-11-rhca-house/">written endorsement</a> of the Reproductive Health Care Act to the Committee’s chairman. Notably, several religious leaders across Rhode Island also publicly expressed support for abortion rights. Rev. Gene Dyszlewski, pastor of Lime Rock Baptist Church in Lincoln, Rhode Island, <a href="http://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/providence/religious-leaders-support-proposed-reproductive-healthcare-bill/1098736705">told WPRI</a> that, “We believe that the freedom to choose is necessary because each person is the proper guardian of their own life and their own soul.”</p>
<p class="p2">We concur deeply. Against a dismaying backdrop of federal retrogression, the responsibility to protect the rights and liberties of all Americans — in this particular case, women especially — now falls on the shoulders of state legislators. Lawmakers in Rhode Island can and must do their part by supporting the Reproductive Health Care Act. Anything less would constitute a grave affront to the thousands of Rhode Islanders for whom reproductive health care access is not a policy abstraction but a day-to-day imperative, an indispensable component of true gender equality. In a state that prides itself on its early history of enshrining freedom of religion and conscience, it is high time for legislators to rise to the occasion, courageously advance that cherished legacy and extend freedom — in full, unadulterated measure — to the people of 21st century Rhode Island.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Thursday, April 12, the University <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/13/sharpe-refectory-gain-cooling-abilities-2019/">announced</a> a multi-million dollar renovation of the Sharpe Refectory’s infrastructure, with the eventual goal of installing permanent cooling abilities there in the summer of 2019. The current plan includes two phases: first, a $4 million upgrade of the electrical system and backup generator; and second, the development of permanent solutions to the currently subpar systems in place for Ratty workers in the summer after the completion of a feasibility report. We applaud the University for taking and making public concrete action to enhance working conditions in the Ratty, and the Brown Student Labor Alliance for its dedication in elevating this cause to the forefront of student activism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The University’s plan will mitigate the harsh conditions that workers in the Ratty kitchens face during the summer months. Employees have previously <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/13/dining-services-gets-heat-lack-ac-ratty/">voiced concerns</a> about the high temperatures in the kitchen while preparing meals over the summer. Sadly, their repeated calls for the installation of air conditioning went mostly unheeded by the University, which renovated the Ratty’s design and furniture layout in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/04/04/new-furniture-adds-class-to-ratty-dining/">2012</a> and planned additional renovations in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/12/03/ratty-renovations-scheduled-to-start-in-spring-2014/">2014</a> and <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/09/25/ratty-renovations-still-on-table/">2015</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why the University did not prioritize safe working conditions for its employees at a much earlier date is more than a little perplexing. High temperatures in the kitchens, after all, pose significant safety threats to those employees who must work in them for hours on end; Ratty workers have reported feeling fatigue, sickness and faintness during their shifts, and noted the fact that the kitchen heat makes them sweat so much that their uniforms stick to their skin. It is heartening to see the University finally making strides in its treatment of Ratty employees, who deserve safe working conditions and are integral to the day-to-day functioning of the University and the wellness of the student body. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also commend the SLA for drawing attention to working conditions in the Ratty and its <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2006/10/12/student-labor-alliance-reward-dining-services-employees-hard-work/">previous work</a> with workers’ rights at Brown. On Wednesday, April 11, the SLA hosted “Fans on Faunce,” an event in which student activists encouraged other members of the community to place fans on the steps of Faunce. The display of fans raised awareness among the wider student body about the Ratty’s overheated kitchens and may have encouraged administrators to unveil renovation plans earlier. With respect to any issue of justice and equity on campus, the buy-in of the student body is crucial for the enactment of long-term reform, and the SLA has recognized and effectively acted upon the responsibility we have, as students, to every member of the Brown community — including those who work so hard to ensure that we have convenient access to three meals a day, every day, in all weather. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultimately, we are glad to see the crystallization of funding and timelines for phase one of the renovation of the Ratty’s kitchen. While phase two begins with a feasibility report, currently underway, we hope the University executes the goals outlined in its recent announcement, develops a permanent fix for working conditions in the Ratty and continues to address, in a timely fashion, the concerns of all its employees. </span></p>

		<title>Editorial: Spring break meal plans need reform</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/23/editorial-spring-break-meal-plans-need-reform/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For students who elect to stay on campus, spring break should be a time of rest, not confusion about the affordability of meal plans and fears of food insecurity. Sadly, the University’s spring break meal plan — which costs $288 for three meals a day over nine days — does little to assuage these concerns and accommodate students’ nutritional needs at an affordable rate. To spare students the undue stress of cobbling together meals over spring break, we urge the University to incorporate a greater degree of transparency with respect to its spring break dining policies and consider alternative spring break dining arrangements.</p>
<p class="p2">The administration offered two <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/19/cost-of-recess-meal-plans-draws-student-scrutiny/">justifications</a> for the meal plan’s additional fee: First, the operating costs of the Sharpe Refectory, the only dining hall kept open, increase during spring break; and second, including the cost of these plans in all students’ meal plans might actually raise aggregate costs for the student body. Neither of these assertions, however, addresses the core issues at hand: Not only does the additional spring break meal plan fee go completely unmentioned on the University’s cost of attendance <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/financial-aid/cost-attendance">webpage</a>, but it also grossly exceeds the typical cost of food for the average individual. According to the <a href="https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/CostofFoodMar2018.pdf">United States Department of Agriculture</a>, Americans aged 19 to 50 living on “moderate” budgets could expect to spend as little as $68.80 on food per week in March 2018 — which works out to $88.46 for nine days. ($288 could almost feed a family of four, with school-aged children, for the duration of Brown’s spring break, as evidenced by the USDA data.) In effect, the University charges more than triple the amount that the government expects average people to spend on food, not including the cost associated with food preparation.</p>
<p class="p2">The University, obviously, understands the importance of unimpeded access to food for the well-being and performance of students: Athletes engaged in strenuous practice and trainings over spring break are given meals at no additional cost. And, to its credit, the University operates a Meal Gap program, which provides meals to students with the highest demonstrated financial need at no additional cost. Roughly 300 students of the 1,000 eligible — who were informed about the program through individual emails — exercised this option.</p>
<p class="p2">Still, the absence of University support for the thousands of other students who receive financial aid, and may also work on-campus jobs to supplement that aid, leaves a substantial proportion of the student body without clear, accessible food options during spring break. Why low-income students and students on financial aid — not just those who, in the eyes of administrators, meet an unspecified threshold of demonstrated need — are not also protected by the University’s generosity is utterly baffling. Instead, to secure nutritional support over spring break, these students must reach out to the Dean of the College on their own and navigate a process about which there is virtually no publicly available guidance or information.</p>
<p class="p2">Students, of course, could choose to decline the University’s meal plan and fend for themselves by purchasing groceries or meals independently. But for students without easy access to clean, well-stocked kitchens — kitchens in Brown residence halls are often unusable, either because they are missing <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2010/10/25/lucia-seda-12-where-did-my-kitchen-go/">key infrastructure</a>, as some students have attested, or because they have been <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2009/09/09/some-students-still-being-housed-in-kitchens/">converted into rooms</a> — grocery shopping is not a pragmatic option. And buying meals at eateries on College Hill is still a hugely expensive proposition — especially when students have already paid for a pricey meal plan from Brown University Dining Services — potentially forcing students to dip into their savings or scrounge the funds needed to pay for restaurant meals.</p>
<p class="p2">For more productive models of spring break dining plans, Brown might consider looking to other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/opinion/sunday/spring-break-colleges-poor-students.html">postsecondary institutions</a>, many of which have have experimented quite successfully with alternative meal plans that better help students avoid episodic hunger. Connecticut College, for example, no longer charges students for on-campus meal plans during school-year breaks, while Columbia, George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University have opened food banks stocked with healthy options for students. <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/25/money-spring-break-dining/">Harvard</a> even grants students with high demonstrated need a $225 stipend, which students can use at any restaurant in the vicinity of campus.</p>
<p class="p2">Of course, emulating another university’s dining policies or enacting any single policy reform will not immediately make the experience of food insecurity — from which approximately <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X17741303?ai=1gvoi&amp;mi=3ricys&amp;af=R&amp;">half</a> of American college students suffer — magically disappear from students’ lives. But the University cannot pretend like the problem is marginal enough that sustained, long-term change is somehow unnecessary or burdensome to the student body. Of all the obstacles to learning and personal development, hunger ranks among the highest, and the University should do whatever it takes to reform gaps in current dining policy and ensure that students have access to regular, affordable nutrition on campus.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Sept. 12, Rhode Island voters will have the chance to cast their ballots in <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/04/candidates-crowd-primary-elections/">primary elections</a> for offices at the local, state and federal level. The midterm general elections are in November, when all the seats in the House of Representatives and 35 seats in the Senate will be up for vote. These two election days will have a momentous impact on the direction of the United States. Still, the low turnout of young voters — who, almost reliably, do not vote in midterms — is deeply worrisome, and even threatens to compromise the sanctity of our representative system, widening the mismatch between elected representatives and the constituents to whom they are ultimately responsible. (To be sure, the problem of underwhelming turnout is not limited to young people: Across age groups, four in 10 registered voters did not participate in the 2016 presidential elections; President Trump won with fewer than 80,000 votes in three states.) This election season, in a political moment fraught with cantankerous partisanship and grassroots energy, we urge students — at colleges in Rhode Island and young people more generally — to put into practice their electoral power, get registered and vote. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The sorry turnout rates of young voters is a persistent problem in American politics. In the 2016 presidential election, only 46.1 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds voted — the lowest reported voting rate of any age group. In contrast, the second-lowest group, 30 to 44-year-olds, boasted a voting rate over 12 percentage points higher. In midterm elections, young people’s voting percentages are even lower: The turnout rate of millennials between the ages of 18 and 24 — the age of most college students — is only 20 percent. Meanwhile, baby boomers between the ages of 45 and 49 have a voter turnout rate of 52 percent in midterm elections. While millennials, and young people as a whole, make up a significant portion of the American electorate, their voices are drowned out by the interests of other groups, simply because they don’t vote. In a country experiencing tectonic shifts in demographic constitution and economic security — along with regular attacks on American ideals and democratic institutions once considered invulnerable — the choice to sit on the sidelines during elections has tremendous, troubling consequences for the future. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to a recent Tufts study, students at Brown have a higher turnout rate than the average university, as 59 percent of eligible students voted in the 2016 presidential election. (In 2012, the student body’s turnout rate was one percentage point below the national average.) This is welcome news — but it is still disconcerting that over four out of every 10 eligible Brown students did not cast a ballot. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the United States, it is easy to take representation for granted. But, in truth, voting is a precious right in perilous condition. Across the country, legislators in eight states have introduced 16 bills to restrict voting — through limits on absentee and early voting — on top of the 35 restrictive bills carried over from the previous legislative sessions of 14 states. The burden of restricted voting disproportionately affects black and Hispanic voters, who report experiencing a number of roadblocks — including lacking proper identification, missing registration deadlines, experiencing harassment and having trouble taking time off work and finding their polling place — at higher rates than white Americans. These obstacles, in total, tend to favor Republican candidates. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To their credit, student organizations have made available numerous ways to get involved in local, state and national politics through the activism of partisan student groups and the debates and lectures hosted by non-partisan clubs. The University is also making a concerted effort to increase voter turnout. On Oct. 9 at 7 p.m., the Swearer Center is hosting an Elections Cafe, in which students can talk with local candidates and elected officials. The Swearer Center has also partnered with Turbo Vote, a platform that allows students to easily find information about registration and voting. And this week, the Salomon Center on the Main Green will be used as a polling place. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We applaud all the University staff and students who are working toward voter education and increasing young people’s access to voting. But these efforts mean nothing unless students take advantage of them. We hope that, this election cycle, students will have the opportunity to convert their political convictions into action, cast their ballots and assert their voice in the formation of America’s future. </span></p>

		<title>Editorial: ResLife needs to reevaluate its structure</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/16/editorial-reslife-needs-reevaluate-structure/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This past summer, the Office of Residential Life faced a series of crippling personnel departures. Currently, ResLife has on staff only two community directors, who are responsible for managing essentially one-third of campus dormitory facilities each and training the entire 2018 cohort of Residential Peer Leaders. Four community director positions are vacant, and there is no associate director to supervise the community directors.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ResLife’s hemorrhaging of manpower has sweeping implications for various dimensions of campus life. The office’s remaining staff members have been forced to take on nearly double their typical workloads, an unsustainable arrangement that cannot possibly bode well for workplace quality and morale. And Residential Peer Leaders — enforcers of University policy and first points of contact for students in need of support — have expressed serious concern that the instruction and resources available to them will be dramatically curtailed <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/04/office-of-residential-life-understaffed/">this semester</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Indeed, it has become abundantly clear that there are long-standing, systemic problems within ResLife — which, in aggregate, jeopardize the residential experience of first-year students living in University dormitories and the wellbeing of overworked administrative staff. As the new school year starts, the University must organize and publicize a comprehensive response to the struggles plaguing ResLife, one that robustly diagnoses the office’s shortcomings and the risks they pose to student life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">To start with, persistent vacancies and this summer’s flurry of departures suggest that ResLife’s working conditions and organizational structure do not effectively prioritize the welfare and retention of its employees. For the past two years, ResLife has been chronically understaffed, and many employees have reportedly been assigned sets of responsibilities that should, ideally, be shared by a larger number of staff members. This excessive allocation of work is not healthy, exposing ResLife employees to the risk of demoralization and burnout. This distribution of labor also accelerates a vicious cycle of personnel problems: Understaffing begets more understaffing. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Relatedly, the current structure of the CD position makes it difficult to retain CDs and avoid regular staff shortages over the long term. As an entry-level position, the CD is intended to only serve in the position for three to five years, according to Mary Grace Almandrez, the dean of students. (The four CDs who left ResLife this year had had an average tenure of only 2.25 years, The Herald previously reported.) In other words, transience is embedded into the job, making it challenging to preserve institutional memory and ensure that every single available position is staffed to capacity at all times. The University should undertake a thorough reassessment of ResLife’s workplace conditions and the structural incentives of the CD position.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Chronic understaffing within ResLife also profoundly undermines the office’s mission — to realize a safe and enjoyable residential experience for students living on campus. In particular, RPLs, who must be on the front lines of conflict and crises with residents, have been trained under fundamentally unideal conditions. This training is critical for RPLs to be able to properly respond to a myriad of potential issues in our residential halls, such as incidents of racial bias or violence and critical physical and mental health emergencies. To ensure that students in on-campus residences have access to the best support system possible, RPLs must have reliable, unencumbered access to their own system of support.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, the University’s response to ResLife’s staffing troubles, an external review, is disappointing. The exact details of this review — its<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>timeframe, findings and administrative follow-up — should be shared with the public. Only then can members of the community begin to meaningfully hold ResLife to account and ensure that such sustained disruptions to residential life at Brown — such threats to the welfare of employees, RPLs and students — never occur again.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In July, the University announced it will <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/05/u-removes-sat-act-writing-requirement/">no longer require</a> applicants to the class of 2023 to submit their scores for the essay portions of the SAT and ACT. According to Dean of Admission Logan Powell, the requirement may have discouraged low-income students who rely on free, school-day SAT testing from applying to the University, since not all SAT tests administered during the school week offer a writing component. Incoming applicants who take a non-essay standardized exam are “encouraged,” but not required, to submit a graded paper from a high school humanities course instead. We applaud the decision to remove the writing score requirement from the University’s admission policy and the efforts to critically examine the ways in which Brown can be made more accessible to those traditionally underserved and marginalized by existing college admission processes. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The writing portion of the ACT has been optional since the exam’s inception. Over a decade ago, the College Board included a 25-minute essay in the SAT and raised the highest possible score from 1600 to 2400. In March 2016, the College Board made the essay portion optional, doubled the amount of time for the essay and removed its traditional writing prompts, instead asking test-takers to analyze a given passage. But, because variations of the tests that include an optional writing section cost more, 30 percent of school-day SAT exams and half of school-day ACT exams do not include the essay, potentially dissuading some students from applying to schools with more onerous testing requirements. Some estimates suggest that fewer than 25 universities still require writing scores from standardized exams.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University previously dropped the essay requirement for those seeking admission to the Class of 2021. In lieu of a writing score, the University asked applicants to send either their SAT score and two SAT subject test scores, or their ACT score. Dean of Admission Jim Miller ’73 said of the decision, “We know that tests are stressful and time consuming, and for some people they can be a significant expense. So we want to make sure we’re doing what is in the best interest of the applicants.” The writing section of the ACT was still “strongly recommended” by the Office of Admission.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For the Class of 2022, the University reinstated the writing score requirement for the SAT and ACT. (The University also recommended, but did not require, that applicants take two SAT subject tests.) Powell, who became Dean of Admission in the summer of 2016, cited concerns that applicants were not registering for the exams in time for application deadlines. He also noted that the Office of Admission would use the writing scores to “see how the scores line up with (its) sense of the student’s writing ability” and assess whether applicants “can craft strong, logical, evidence-based arguments,” but that the Office might “adjust (its) policy” later. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The essays included in the SAT and ACT have long been the objects of fierce criticism. A previous Herald editorial noted that “the essay format disproportionately favored students who came from higher socioeconomic backgrounds and the score seemed to not correlate with eventual success in college.” According to a 2004 investigation conducted by the College Board, the introduction of the essay and the subsequent lengthening of the exam resulted in test-takers reporting higher levels of fatigue. Further, critics have called into question the essays’ utility in predicting applicants’ postsecondary academic performance, since students generally have several days — along with the ability to gather facts, outline, revise and cite — to write essays in college. Fairness in grading also became a point of concern: In the past, scorers of the SAT, for example, had only three minutes to evaluate the merits of each essay and did not assess the factual accuracy of students’ arguments and evidence.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be sure, the alternative to the writing requirement — a graded essay written for a class — implemented by the University is not without its own set of potential complications. For example, low-income students may not have the resources, such as writing centers or libraries designed for extensive research, that higher-income students might have. Though the decision to eliminate the essay requirement is one significant step toward greater inclusivity and accessibility, the University should make the policy change permanent, applicable to all future applicants to Brown. And, going forward, it must take unflagging care to ensure that its alternatives do not inadvertently perpetuate the same systemic disadvantages calcified by standardized exams.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">On Saturday, Sept. 22, during the University’s 2018 Black Alumni Reunion weekend, President Christina Paxson P’19 announced the renaming of the heavily frequented, six-story administrative building formerly called J. Walter Wilson to Page-Robinson Hall. Portraits of the two eponymous alums — Inman Edward Page, class of 1877, and Ethel Tremaine Robinson, class of 1905 — already greet students entering the building. We commend the University for its decision to memorialize the extraordinary achievements of Page and Robinson and, in so doing, celebrate the courageous efforts of students of color to build a more inclusive, more just Brown.</p>
<p class="p1">Page and Robinson broke barriers at Brown. Page, born into slavery, was one of the University’s first black graduates; Robinson was the first black woman to graduate from Brown. Both had distinguished records as undergraduates: Page spoke at Commencement; Robinson graduated with honors and won the Class of 1873 Essay Prize. And both became educators later in their lives. The renaming of J. Walter Wilson after these two alums represents a meaningful acknowledgement of the University’s past and its indebtedness to student activists over the years who have fought for diversity and inclusion at Brown. As Bernicestine McLeod Bailey ’68 P’99 P’03 put it in a University press release, “We have a history here — a notable history — and it is something that should be celebrated and recognized by the whole community.”</p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, the names of buildings are serious reflections of an institution’s values: the principles and beliefs that undergird the intellectual and sociocultural life of a community and animate that community’s members. (To be sure, James Walter Wilson, the professor of biology and champion of life sciences research at Brown after whom the Brown St. building was named in 1962, remains a beloved figure at Brown.) The University’s decision to rename J. Walter Wilson takes on added salience in this present moment, as debates on college campuses about university buildings and their namesakes continue to rage. In 2016, Yale renamed one of its residential colleges, Calhoun College — originally named after John C. Calhoun, an American statesman from South Carolina who staunchly supported slavery and states’ rights — when students of color argued that the name made them feel disrespected, alienated and hurt. (The college is now named after Grace Hopper, a pioneering computer scientist.) A year earlier, in 2015, students and faculty members at Clemson University began advocating for the renaming of Tillman Hall, an iconic building on campus named after Benjamin Tillman, the virulently racist former governor of South Carolina.</p>
<p class="p1">Page-Robinson Hall offers the Brown community space for sustained self-reflection and ongoing conversations about historical erasure and future possibilities for racial justice. We hope that, for coming generations of Brunonians, the renamed Page-Robinson Hall will be a source of enduring inspiration — to build on the courage of its namesakes and carry on the unfinished fight for true justice and equality on College Hill.</p>

		<title>Editorial: JUMP bikes are a giant leap for Providence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/19/bike-share-program-comes-providence/">early September</a>, JUMP — the dockless bike-share program owned by Uber — launched in Providence, giving College Hill and other neighborhoods around the city a colorful makeover with its bright red bicycles. The bikes can now be found at 40 docking hubs throughout Providence, and can be easily returned to any public location where the bike can be attached to a fixed installation, such as a bike rack or streetlight. A result of seven years of efforts to bring a bike-share program to Providence, JUMP electric bikes offer numerous benefits to the city and its community members with a new, sustainable mode of transportation. This long-awaited initiative is a much-needed addition to local public transit; we applaud its implementation in Providence, along with the diverse array of stakeholders who made the program possible in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As cities look for ways to ward off heavy vehicle congestion, bike-share programs have become an increasingly popular option for urban planners since bikes are, in fact, incredibly effective in reducing traffic. One <a href="http://mobility-workspace.eu/wp-content/uploads/Bike-shares-impact-on-car-use-3.pdf">2014 study</a> found that the 1,325 bikes operating in Minneapolis/St. Paul’s bike-share scheme contributed to a reduction of 55,000 car miles in just one year. This decrease in car travel not only curtails traffic congestion but also allows cities to reduce fuel consumption, carbon emissions and noise pollution, while encouraging commuters to live physically active lifestyles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bike-share programs are also an effective mechanism for sustainable growth and development. Studies have linked bike-share programs to clear economic benefits; the improved spatial connectivity and accessibility afforded by bicycles result in increased local business patronage and activity. The biggest benefit provided by bike-share programs, according to some researchers, is the economic efficiency unlocked by reduced travel times, increased access to the city and its inhabitants and greater workforce participation. In short, bike share programs allow a larger proportion of urban populations to engage in their communities and local commercial activity at an affordable price.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over time, bike-share programs act as a multiplier of the aforementioned effects by creating a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140513000030">cycling culture</a>, normalizing biking as a desirable form of urban transportation. Research has found that people’s willingness to use bicycles as a mode of transport increases when there are a large number of cyclists in a community. Furthermore, if more people begin to bike, traffic safety increases and injuries are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509004344">reduced</a>. In other words, Programs like JUMP help foster a greater desire among communities as a whole to rely on bicycles as a mode of urban transport, even beyond users of the program.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Providence’s new bike-share program contributes nicely to the city’s broader transportation goals. Since 1990, Providence has identified biking as an important transit option within the city and has worked on a number of infrastructure improvements to promote urban biking since then. Mayor Jorge Elorza’s time in office has brought an increased focus to this initiative; in his <a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/heres-the-status-on-all-of-mayor-elorzas-2014-campaign-promises/1104190414">2014 campaign</a>, Elorza promised to bolster biking infrastructure by <a href="https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/providence/providence-adding-dedicated-bus-bike-lanes-to-enhance-safety/1340257746">adding bike lanes and parking</a>, creating programs around bike safety education and bringing bike sharing to Providence. With the introduction of JUMP bikes, Providence has made it clear that safe, accessible and effective transportation is a critical component of urban life by making tremendous strides toward integrating bikes into broader urban development plans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Critics have fairly pointed out that the program can do more to make sure these benefits are more equitably distributed across the city. For example, JUMP bike docking sites <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1am9hTGIDKu2xYEyjlA-lpntLEpOCPUkv&amp;ll=41.82129179232414%2C-71.40626285495864&amp;z=14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">populate</a> the East Side and are more sparsely distributed in areas like Olneyville and Washington Park. Given the economic advantages of urban bike-share systems, it should be a long-term aspiration for the program to disperse advantages more equitably, and be more accessible to low-income, underserved neighborhoods in Providence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, The Herald has bemoaned, not particularly productively, the state of public transportation in Providence. But the JUMP bike-share program is an undeniably positive addition to existing transit options in the city. Just as importantly, it represents a laudably fruitful partnership between a large number of stakeholders in Providence. The University, for example, convened an internal task force comprised of students, staff and faculty that advised the city on the program’s initiation and identified good locations for bike hubs on campus. The Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority and the Rhode Island School of Design, among other Providence-area organizations, were also involved in the program’s planning. In this way, JUMP bikes are a model for collaboration between public interests and private institutions in the city. Their contributions to life in Providence — from the standpoints of commerce, community engagement and public safety — will certainly be felt for years to come.</span></p>

<em><strong>Correction: A previous version of this editorial stated that JUMP bike docking sites are predominantly situated in the East Side. In fact, 15 of the 46 hub locations are in the East Side. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Editorial: University should buy ProJo subscriptions</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/09/editorial-university-buy-projo-subscriptions/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In mid-September, the Providence Journal <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/business/projo-cuts-reporter-editors-and-photographer-and-3-leave-newport-daily-news">laid off four staffers</a>: Andy Smith, a reporter; Randy Edgar, deputy editorial page editor; Stephen Ide, an online producer; and Glenn Osmundson, a photographer. The Newport Daily News, owned by GateHouse Media, the newspaper conglomerate that also owns the Journal, concurrently announced three staff departures. Taken together, these staff reductions are merely the <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/business/more-staff-reductions-at-projo-and-big-price-increase">latest round</a> in a series of personnel cuts carried out by GateHouse. This July, company executives told news employees across New England that it was considering more buyouts. A <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/business/providence-journal-has-shrunk-far-more-than-ever-reported">transformed media environment</a>, which now relies on digital content and technology-oriented models for generating advertising revenue, has likely put a major dent in the Journal’s readership and its financial viability. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For all Rhode Islanders, the accelerating deterioration of the Journal is terrible news. A local newspaper, published in print every day, is the civic lifeblood of a community, the principal instrument for holding the powerful accountable, a historical archive of current events and culture and promoter of broad-based participation in local life. This is not hyperbole. Americans rely on local newspapers, <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2011/09/26/part-3-the-role-of-newspapers/">oftentimes more than any other news source</a>, to provide information about community issues like schools, social services, crime and municipal and city government. And it is these issues — not the heavily reported, televised dramas of Congress and the White House — that have the most significant and immediate effects on the lives of ordinary people. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">For this reason, we urge the University to play its part in the defense of local news — and, by extension, the well-being of the Providence community — and buy individual subscriptions to the Journal for all students, faculty and staff. Purchasing such a subscription would, in one stroke, support the Journal’s reporting, advance the University’s educational mission and lend credence to its self-image as a benevolent force for local economic and civic good. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An influx of subscription revenue from the University, of course, will not magically eliminate the systemic challenges facing print media outlets, though it might help the Journal retain more reporters and editorial staff and reinvigorate the quality of its journalism. As the past few years have evinced, the contraction of the Journal’s newsroom has had severe ramifications for its editorial content and coverage. The Journal — the “<a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170715/alan-rosenberg-providence-journals-188th-birthday-mystery">oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the country</a>,” the most prominent newspaper serving the Providence metropolitan area and the recipient of four Pulitzer Prizes — now has only one editorial writer, Ed Achorn, and 15 news reporters on staff. And, according to GoLocalProv, only a fraction of the news articles published in the Journal are written by the Journal’s own reporters; the rest are reports penned by freelancers or wire stories from services like the Associated Press. (For context, the Journal’s newsroom once employed 300 reporters and editors in the 1980s and 1990s; the editorial page board consisted of seven writers a decade ago.) The Journal’s woes cannot be rectified by any single move, but University subscriptions would be an excellent first step in helping the Journal develop a sustainable business plan going forward.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just as importantly, University-supplied access to the Journal will be a significant benefit for young students, who are the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-w-whitehead/why-local-newspapers-are_b_184606.html">least likely age group to read newspapers</a>. The University already provides free access to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, both of which are invaluable sources for national news and opinion. But missing from these offerings is a robust platform for news and opinion oriented toward Providence and Rhode Island, communities that afford members of the Brown community countless opportunities for direct engagement, meaningful learning and committed service. In the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/orientation/sites/brown.edu.academics.college.orientation/files/uploads/PYLE.pdf">guide to liberal learning</a> distributed to new students, the Office of the Dean of the College specifically advises, “Real-world experiences anchor intellectual pursuits in practical knowledge and help you develop a sense of social and global responsibility.” This expectation to contextualize classroom-based learning and scholarship within our communities is a core principle of the Brown education — one that cannot be truly realized without unencumbered access to a local newspaper. How can students be asked to “develop a sense of global responsibility” if they are unaware of what’s going on downtown, in Providence City Hall or in the State House — all just a few blocks away from College Hill? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, subscriptions to the Journal would constitute a long-term investment in the cohesion and integration of the Providence community. In its “<a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/07/innovation">Brown and the Innovation Economy</a>” strategic plan, unveiled in June 2018, the University observes, “A region’s ability to generate, share and absorb new knowledge is central to its ability to support growing companies and create good jobs.” While there are clear distinctions between journalists reporting the news and academics pursuing scientific truth, scholars have long considered newspapers <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0038026117704832">instruments of knowledge production</a> — and supporting local news is a clear means of supporting local knowledge. When local newspapers shutter their doors, the consequences are staggering: Civic engagement and voter turnout almost immediately <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10584609.2012.762817?needAccess=true">decline</a>. And the costs of municipal borrowing soar — thanks to the corruption and <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/commentary/2018/06/06/a-new-study-measures-the-cost-of-corruption-when-the-local-newspaper-dies">self-dealing</a> enabled by the closure of local papers — making it vastly more difficult for communities to make the investments needed to support local infrastructure, deliver social services and facilitate commercial activity. As Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York’s 12th congressional district said at a <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111shrg55622/html/CHRG-111shrg55622.htm">2009 hearing of the Joint Economic Committee</a>, “Without our newspapers, we lack a critical uniting feature, which fosters broad participation in our democracy and community.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In this light, the creeping infirmity of the Providence Journal and other local newspapers is not an abstract or theoretical risk to democratic institutions and local life — it is a real and serious threat, with dismaying implications for the unity and well-being of American communities. But this moment also presents an opportunity for the University to step up, act on its economic and civic commitments, bolster the education it provides and support the Journal by purchasing subscriptions. After all, The Herald is used to calling itself Rhode Island’s second-largest print daily. We’d like to keep it that way.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><em><span class="s1">Editorials are written by The Herald’s editorial page board: Anuj Krishnamurthy ’19, Rhaime Kim ’20, Grace Layer ’20, Mark Liang ’19 and </span><span class="s1">Krista Stapleford ’21.

<em><strong>Clarification: A previous version of this editorial advocated that the University buy an institutional subscription to the Journal to make the Journal accessible to students, faculty and staff members. It pointed to the University’s arrangements with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, which give individual Brown community members nearly unlimited access to online content on their respective websites, as models. </strong></em>
<p class="m_-978586085367594373gmail-p1"><em><strong>In fact, the University provides access to the Journal for Brown community members through the library website, which links to the hosting sites ProQuest, which provides text-only access, and NewsBank, which provides scans of the print edition and searchable text. The editorial has been updated to replace the word institutional with individual when referring to subscriptions to eliminate ambiguity. The Herald regrets the error.</strong></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Editorial: University must do more for grad student housing</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/23/editorial-university-must-grad-student-housing/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being a graduate student is tough. Students enrolled in Brown’s master’s, doctoral and pre-professional programs spend as many as six years conducting research, procuring funding and support for that research, teaching undergraduates and writing dissertations. Tack on the imperatives of networking, maintaining relationships with mentors and advisors and securing positions in academia or industry after graduation, and there’s little time left in most graduate students’ schedules. But at Brown, there can be just one more thing to care of: Making sure your house doesn’t imminently fall apart, while difficult, sometimes abusive, landlords do little to help.</span></p>
<p class="p2">It is no surprise to anyone familiar with living off-campus that there are serious issues with housing options near Brown. There are several houses and apartments with collapsing ceilings in bathrooms, unresponsive landlords and other unfortunate surprises. Without a centralized renting process, graduate students and their families can be subject to scams and high rents. For international students — many of whom must navigate the American renting process before even stepping foot in the country — finding and maintaining housing can pose a particularly thorny challenge, as area landlords have resorted to abuse and threats of deportation to stop them from raising concerns about their living facilities.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Housing-related headaches can be attributed in large part to the lack of competitive options in the University’s vicinity. The University doesn’t have adequate housing, either on-or off-campus, to deal with its growing population of undergraduate and graduate students. To be sure, this housing deficit is a grave problem not only for the University’s quality of life but also for its aspirations of becoming a top-tier destination for advanced research. Indeed, the dearth of reliable housing may jeopardize the University’s ability to attract and retain high-caliber graduate students, who might choose other research universities with more convenient housing options. Consider the case of a doctoral candidate, who is married with kids. They are making, at minimum, a five- to six-year commitment to a single doctoral program. On top of fulfilling personal obligations and coursework, why would they also want to spend all those years dealing with the complications associated with housing on College Hill?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We implore the University to make the provision of new housing options — a measure supported by the Graduate Student Council — a priority in its long-term infrastructure plans. To begin, the University can try to build new dormitories and apartment facilities, or buy nearby properties and turn them into University-subsidized housing. None of this will be cheap, of course. But, given the construction of the new performing arts center, the expansion of the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, the completed renovation of Friedman Hall and the planning of an undergraduate wellness dorm, it is clear that the administration — and the University’s financial backers — are willing to devote considerable resources to new development. Why not concurrently devote resources to the development or refurbishment of the University’s housing facilities? New dormitories and apartments constitute a critical investment in the ability of the University to attract talented students, just as important as new performance spaces and classrooms. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Peer schools, for their part, have recognized this reality: Yale and Cornell, for example, have 11 and three buildings, respectively, that are exclusively dedicated to housing graduate students. To be sure, it is not enough to rely on private developers — one of which, Steeple Street RI, LLC, is in the process of constructing luxury apartments on Canal Street — to fill the housing shortage. Even large real estate companies promising high-quality facilities can offer shoddy services, charge high fees and provide a poor quality of residential life, as Yale graduate students have experienced. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the near-term, the University should provide substantially increased support for graduate students seeking rental apartments on College Hill. The administration might put together a clear guide specifically to address concerns of incoming graduate students — who can have different needs from those of undergraduates — about how to navigate the rental environment in Providence and what rights they have as they interact with landlords. It might also assemble and distribute a list of properties run by landlords who are known to be reliable and trustworthy. These efforts certainly won’t solve every residential woe incurred by graduate students, but they’re a good starting point for further and more aggressive action down the road. After all, the University’s status as an institution committed to robust research and instruction depends not only on brand-new academic buildings, but also on competitive — and livable — housing on and around campus. </span></p>

		<title>Editorial: University right to pay tour guides</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last week, The Herald reported that the Office of College Admission will pay undergraduate tour guides $11 an hour starting in 2019. We wholeheartedly commend this decision on the part of the University to compensate tour guides. (Previously, the University was one of just three Ivy League schools that did not pay their tour guides.) At a selective university like Brown, it is hard to overstate how much tour guides contribute to the University’s admission efforts. They field hundreds of questions, actively advocate for the University and often are the first real students that prospective applicants meet. An excellent group of undergraduate guides is fundamental evidence of an engaged student body, and paying these students for their service has been a long time coming.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The work of giving campus tours to large groups of visitors is highly demanding. It requires flexibility and the kind of relentless positive energy needed to assuage anxious applicants and answer the inquiries of overbearing parents. Just as important, tour guides are entrusted with introducing people unfamiliar with Brown to the culture and intellectual life of campus. As a University pamphlet from the early 2000s reads, “A stroll around the Green affords a tour in microcosm of Brown’s history and a glimpse of the vitality and diversity of the campus today.” Student guides are the principal stewards of that narrative.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The most important benefit of paying tour guides will be the inclusion of more students of low-income backgrounds in the tour guide staff. Being a tour guide is by no means an easy commitment, as students must lead tours around their class schedules and many extracurriculars. Compensation now provides the opportunity to become a tour guide to students who might have otherwise not been able to be one. Having tour guides on staff who represent the full range of the socioeconomic spectrum in the United States is absolutely essential for the recruitment of talented students. We hope Brown continues to actively construct a cohort of tour guides that effectively represents the University, its commitment to diversity and its intellectual mission. Supporting these students by treating their work as paid employment is a wonderful first step.</span></p>

		<title>Editorial: Endangered scholars consortium shows U. commitment to academic freedom</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the past few years, students, academics and professors at institutions of higher learning around the world have increasingly become targets of violent attacks and unlawful imprisonment, simply for expressing ideas that run counter to the ideologies of extremist groups and authoritarian regimes in their home countries. On Sept. 6, the University became a founding member of the New University in Exile Consortium, promising to host and support endangered scholars who currently face threats to their rights and livelihoods. In doing so, the University has commendably <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/mission">declared its commitment</a> to preserving “a spirit of free inquiry” and has made a definitive statement to the world that academic freedom is critical for the preservation of free societies, particularly in this moment in history.</p>
<p class="p1">First established in 1933 as the University in Exile by the New School for Social Research, the Consortium was originally formed to save the lives of intellectuals and scholars who were purged from their universities and persecuted by fascists and Nazis in Europe. Today, however, the perils facing academics have assumed new, complicated forms and taken root all over the world, in places like Turkey, Syria, Libya and Iraq. The new Consortium, which consists of 11 universities throughout the United States, seeks to bring public awareness to these emergent threats to institutions of higher education, and to support persecuted, displaced scholars by providing a safe haven for them. The Consortium will also bring these scholars together for workshops, seminars and conferences.</p>
<p class="p1">Through its membership in the Consortium, the University makes a significant contribution to the global welfare of academics by fighting back against the violence that threatens to undermine one of the key pillars of a free society — the freedom to think, explore and disseminate ideas. Many scholars are targeted specifically for the types of work they do and the initiatives they lead, many of which are vital to the advancement of human rights. By inviting these scholars onto our campus, we help ensure that in the immediate future they are able to continue doing important work, and that their lives and the lives of their families are not endangered because of it.</p>
<p class="p1">Inviting endangered scholars onto campus will also advance and better enable the pursuit of knowledge conducted here. Through the courses they teach and research they conduct on campus, these scholars will enrich intellectual life here, and afford students rare opportunities to think critically about a myriad of important social and academic issues. They will likely bring new cultural and social awareness to the University that will enhance our community’s understanding of the world in which we are situated — something that can benefit every student, no matter their concentration or degree program.</p>
<p class="p1">The University has already been hosting endangered scholars since 2015, so joining the New University in Exile Consortium is an excellent way for Brown to formalize its commitment to protecting the globe’s intellectual community from assaults on institutions of higher education. We hope that, going forward, the University<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>will continue to marshall its influence as an elite institution to support and safeguard higher education and intellectual inquiry throughout the world.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In June, the University unveiled the Brown and the Innovation Economy Strategic Plan, an initiative to support economic development and entrepreneurship in Rhode Island. The University aims to promote job creation and innovative commercial activity in the local economy by supporting talent development and retention and building a regional network of business leaders, investors and technology developers. We applaud the University for articulating a clear commitment to enhancing the vitality and long-term prospects of the Rhode Island economy. As the wealthiest institution of higher education in the state, the University has long played a significant role in Rhode Island’s economy. Still, as the University embarks on the ambitious process of realizing the strategic plan’s central objectives, it must address the issue of local inequality and ensure that its efforts will yield broad-based growth that delivers positive outcomes and opportunities for all Rhode Islanders. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The strategic plan commits the University to forging strong, long-term partnerships with students, policymakers and businesspeople in the surrounding community. For example, the University’s Office of Industry Engagement and Commercial Venturing will support the Rhode Island Innovation Hub, a collaboration between industry and academics to support innovation and the commercialization of new technologies. In addition, the Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship will administer Brown Venture Founders, a program designed to incentivize University graduates to launch their startups in Providence. The strategic plan’s other goals include deepening ties with industry, facilitating cooperation between University researchers and businesses and commercializing discoveries in biomedicine. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While it is impossible to precisely predict how much the University’s strategic plan will drive economic growth, the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/metropolitan-revolution/2017/10/11/five-reasons-why-downtown-universities-matter-for-economic-growth/">literature</a> suggests that University expenditures — coupled with the creation of highly concentrated districts that host technology developers, researchers and investors — can make a substantial contribution to the local economy. Universities well-integrated in the commercial fabric of their host cities generate more patents and startups than schools in suburbs, rural areas or college towns. And for every $1 spent by a university in an urban area, the average income in the surrounding city grows by 89 cents. Given these realities, it is safe to say that the strategic plan gives the University a solid chance to support the development of a vibrant and innovative Rhode Island economy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet, while the University has made ambitious commitments to supporting local entrepreneurship and commercial activity, its strategic plan fails to make any mention of inequality — a particularly acute problem in Rhode Island. Providence is one of the most unequal cities in the United States, having simultaneously experienced precipitous declines in manufacturing and rapid growth in well-off neighborhoods such as College Hill. The statistics are startling: In one low-income tract in downtown Providence, children are predicted to have an annual household salary of $23,000 as adults. Black low-income residents of Federal Hill are projected to make $12,000 per year. But in the tract that includes much of the University and Rhode Island School of Design, children are <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/10/19/research-reveals-providence-socioeconomic-divisions/">predicted</a> to have an annual household salary of $72,000.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These disparities in economic opportunities are caused by multiple factors including local crime, poverty and access to education. In general, American cities and towns featuring large universities, despite their aforementioned contributions to local commercial activity, often experience considerable inequality. In <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/10/how_the_gap_between_rich_and_poor_is_growing_in_syracuse.html">Syracuse, New York</a>, the number of households in higher income brackets increased during the 2014-15 school year, but one in two children still lives in poverty. In <a href="http://www.city-data.com/income/income-Richmond-Virginia.html">Richmond, Virginia</a>, the average household income in the tract that includes the University of Richmond is $73,542; in another tract, almost 50 percent of residents are below the poverty line, with a median household income of $9,583.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Of course, the University cannot reasonably be expected to solve all of the entrenched injustices and obstacles to opportunity that create inequality in Providence or Rhode Island. But the University does have a responsibility to support the kind of economic<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>growth that extends opportunity to all of the neighborhoods in Providence, and it should develop a strategy for doing so. We certainly do not have all the answers, and we fully acknowledge that spurring innovative growth that delivers prosperity to all segments of society will not be easy. But in asking the University to critically examine how it might combat inequality through its strategic plan, we are fundamentally concerned with the character of Brown and its role in community life in the years to come. As John Logan, professor of sociology, told The Herald, the University “can be perceived as a progressive force, helping to revitalize the city, or it can be seen as participating in a kind of growth whose benefits will be reaped by some kinds of people and not others.” We hope that the University selects the former route in its efforts to improve innovation and economic activity in Rhode Island.</span></p>

		<title>Editorial: Project Tampon updates welcome news, but questions remain</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the fall of 2016, Brown students were welcomed back onto campus with the heartening news that the Undergraduate Council of Students would <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/09/09/ucs-to-provide-pads-tampons/">begin supplying pads and tampons</a> in women’s, men’s and gender-inclusive restrooms throughout campus — an initiative now known as Project Tampon. In the spring of 2018, however, the project was put on pause, as UCS worked throughout the rest of the academic year to transfer the responsibility for the program’s administration over to the University. Since April 2018, when The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/26/ucs-asks-facilities-administer-project-tampon/">reported on these changes</a>, the exact status or future of Project Tampon <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/09/12/new-ucs-leadership-outlines-plans-year/">remained unclear</a> to the community.</p>
<p class="p2">Last Tuesday, UCS President Shanzé Tahir '19 and UCS Vice President Camila Pelsinger ’20 stated in a community-wide update that dispensers around campus are being stocked with free menstrual hygiene products. UCS also noted plans to install more dispensers in restrooms around campus. In today’s Herald, the Department of Facilities Management has finally confirmed that it will take over the administration of Project Tampon. While we applaud UCS leadership and Facilities for successfully institutionalizing Project Tampon, key questions around the project’s path to sustainable implementation remain.</p>
<p class="p2">For one, it is unclear why institutionalizing the project necessitated the level of confusion the Brown community experienced over the past year. The program was plagued by miscommunication while it remained in limbo. While former UCS President Chelse Amoy-Steele ’18 explained to the student body at the beginning of her term last year that institutionalizing Project Tampon was a priority, the project’s status as Facilities and UCS began talks was never made clear. In April last semester, UCS halted the distribution of free menstrual products without notifying the student body, The Herald previously reported. At the end of the last semester, Steele sent an email to UCS general body members explaining that Facilities would take charge of Project Tampon this fall, but The Herald was unable to confirm this with the administration over the summer and as of Sept. 17. Though Tahir initially informed the first UCS meeting of the 2018-19 academic year that Project Tampon’s transfer to Facilities Management was “all set to go,” Tahir later told The Herald that “UCS is looking into Project Tampon’s sustained implementation” after being informed of the University’s response.</p>
<p class="p2">Tahir and Pelsinger’s update last week is a welcome breath of fresh air in a situation that has been rife with inconsistency. But while UCS has made strides in terms of transparency, on an institutional level the Council must reassess the manner in which it communicated the status of Project Tampon to the wider Brown community to ensure that future updates are timely and responsive to student concerns.</p>
<p class="p2">Facilities’ update in today’s Herald taking ownership of Project Tampon’s administration also provided much-needed clarity on the status of the project. Facilities outlines a plan for the program’s expansion beyond the 32 campus buildings where one can currently access free menstrual products. Specifically, women’s restrooms that don’t already have dispensers will be equipped with them, as will gender-inclusive restrooms in the Stephen Robert ’62 Campus Center and Page-Robinson Hall. Three restrooms in the Rockefeller Library are also slated to be installed with dispensers.</p>
<p class="p2">But the plan still lacks key details: a clear timeline for the implementation of these changes and information on the sourcing of the menstrual products. Providing a timeline would serve as a mechanism for community members to ensure accountability, and is particularly called for in light of the delays and miscommunication the transfer has already encountered. Though UCS has erred in communicating the transfer of the program to Facilities, it commendably was very open with students over the sourcing of menstrual products. In October 2017, when students raised concerns about Tampon Tribe, UCS changed suppliers and communicated this change promptly to community members less than 12 hours after a public announcement of the Tampon Tribe partnership. At the time, UCS indicated that it would be sourcing tampons from Boxed; in June 2018, Steele wrote in a community-wide email that Project Tampon would be using Aunt Flow, a gender-inclusive company that creates 100 percent organic compostable products. Facilities would do well to follow UCS’ lead in this regard and inform community members of how it will source products as the department takes over its implementation.</p>
<p class="p2">To be sure, the importance of Project Tampon cannot be overstated; its objectives lie at the very heart of the University’s values of promoting diversity and inclusion on campus. By offering free hygiene products in certain public restrooms around campus, Project Tampon actively breaks down the economic barriers that those who menstruate face while juggling the typical stresses of college life. Without the necessary hygiene products, it becomes impossible for these students to attend classes, focus on their studies and be active and engaged members of our community. This project is an incredibly impactful way for the University to better ensure that every student feels comfortable at Brown and has the resources at hand to thrive here. Institutionalizing the program is no less of an achievement for UCS leadership and demonstrates the University’s commitment to the well-being of its students. But it is clear that Project Tampon could have benefitted — and, going forward, can benefit — from more timely communication to empower students to hold the University to the standards it has set for itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>

		<title>Editorial: U.’s adjusted paid leave policies are commendable</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This month, the University modified its paid sick and safe leave policies to be in compliance with the Rhode Island Sick and Safe Leave Act, signed into law by Gov. Gina Raimondo last year and put into effect this summer. The Act applies to all Rhode Island employers with more than 18 employees. It requires Brown to expand “the amount of paid leave available to part-time and student employees and broaden the circumstances” for which leave-taking is permitted, The Herald previously reported. We are glad the University has quickly adjusted to new state policy and worked to enhance the benefits available to its employees.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Prior to the passage of the Rhode Island Sick and Safe Leave Act, the University’s paid leave policies applied only to employees who worked more than “50 percent time,” The Herald previously reported. In addition to covering part-time and student employees, the University’s new policies allow employees to take leave for caregiving responsibilities, which now include attending to safety issues such as stalking and sexual violence. By 2020, Rhode Island employees will have guaranteed access to up to 40 hours of leave. The Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training will begin penalizing employers for noncompliance starting Jan. 1, 2019.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the United States, federal law does not require employers to provide paid sick leave. (The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave to eligible employees, who can use the time for caregiving responsibilities and family members’ medical emergencies.) According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, 34 million Americans, close to one-third of all private sector employees, do not have paid sick leave. The lack of paid sick leave particularly harms survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault; the Centers for Disease Control found that a substantial number of American men and women have suffered some sort of abuse at the hands of intimate partners. In light of these circumstances, we are heartened by the decision to allow employees to address stalking and sexual violence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thankfully, the momentum in favor of paid sick leave has accelerated in recent years. In 2011, Connecticut became the first state to mandate that private sector employers provide paid sick leave. This year, Maryland and New Jersey passed their own paid sick leave legislation. As of October 2018, 19 cities, three counties and 10 states in total — including Rhode Island — require employers to provide paid sick leave. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University’s new policies will benefit its employees profoundly. On a fundamental level, no one should have to choose between working and caring for themselves or their loved ones. We are particularly supportive of the University’s decision to not require documentation for every instance of leave-taking, as many employees or students may not have the time or resources to fill out forms and collect signed letters. We hope that, in the coming years, the University continues to stay abreast of the law and update its policies to ensure that employees feel safe, healthy and supported in their work.</span></p>

		<title>Editorial: UFB’s budget reports need to be comprehensive and timely</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Nov. 21, the Undergraduate Finance Board released its <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/26/undergraduate-finance-board-releases-budget/">budget report</a> for the 2018-2019 academic year. According to the report, UFB’s approximately $2.2 million budget comes primarily from the $286 student activities fee all Brown students must pay. UFB’s budget report describes its allocation process at length, and breaks down the budget into broad categories of expenditures, such as event support, annual budgeting and supplemental budgeting. But, while the budget report is helpful in demonstrating broad categories of organizations and services funded by the activities fee, it is not detailed enough — especially considering how high our student activities fee is compared to our Ivy League peers. In future budget reports, the UFB should continue to increase transparency around the activities fee so undergraduates can have a clearer idea as to how their money is being used; release the reports on time; and provide more granular details about the allocation of the budget. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of the Ivy League institutions that list their student activities fees online, the University has the highest fee. (<a href="https://admission.princeton.edu/cost-aid/fees-payment-options">Princeton</a> and <a href="http://www.srfs.upenn.edu/paying/fees.htm">Penn</a> include their activities fees in larger expenses; they do not make available the student activities fees they charge.) <a href="https://tdi.dartmouth.edu/application/files/7715/0523/0467/Tuition-and-Fees-Details.pdf">Dartmouth</a> has the lowest activities fee, at $75, while <a href="http://www.srfs.upenn.edu/paying/fees.htm">Cornell</a>, the school with the second-highest fee in the Ivy League, still only charges students $234. Because the University has a relatively high fee, it is even more important for students to clearly understand which initiatives and organizations their money is supporting. Going forward, the UFB should explain why our student activities fee is so high when compared to our peers, and how the University determines the activities fee.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The student activities fee is primarily associated with student groups and clubs. However, UFB also funds many initiatives and activities on campus that one might intuitively deem the financial responsibility of the University. For example, $75,000 of the budget is given to Club Athletics. These 11 club sports teams are all managed by the Department of Athletics, yet continue to receive UFB funding and follow UFB policies. It is unclear why Athletics does not supply the funding for club sports. An additional chunk of the budget is given to the Sarah Doyle Women’s Center, the LGBTQ Center and the Brown Center for Students of Color. While these organizations are extremely important to the Brown community and deserve adequate funding, it is similarly unclear why the University does not fully fund these affinity centers and why they must rely on the student activities fee for support. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To its credit, UFB has taken a fairly significant step toward greater transparency this year by publishing a report about its budgeting process. But it is important that these reports be released on the timeline set by UFB’s own members so that undergraduates have the time to read and digest them fully. UFB’s first budget report was initially projected to be released at the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/26/undergraduate-finance-board-releases-budget/">end of September</a>. The report has instead come at the end of November. For the majority of the first half of the school year, therefore, students had no way of knowing how their activities fee was being spent. UFB has stated that it hopes the student body gives feedback on fund allocation, but in late November, no changes can reasonably be articulated and enacted this semester.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Finally, the report does not include enough information for students to fully understand the budget. While the groupings provide some structure, almost 51 percent of the funds falls under “Annual Budgeting,” a nebulous category that includes all student organization funding that is predicted at the end of the spring term for the following year. Brown has over 400 clubs and student organizations, and it would be useful to learn how much money each organizationreceives, particularly the largest recipients of UFB funding. This breakdown is certainly feasible; the Cornell Student Assembly published an <a href="https://assembly.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/sa-2010-2018-overview.pdf">allocation overview</a> for 2010 to 2018, naming each organization and how much money it receives from the student activities fee. This level of transparency allows students to advocate for the specific changes they would like to see in the budget in more detail than is currently possible. In a similar vein, UFB ought to take another cue from Cornell and offer more historical background about the student activities fee. This would better allow students to understand the purpose of the fee and how it has changed over time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ultimately, while the budget report demonstrates UFB’s efforts to bolster transparency, it does not provide enough information to allow students to provide meaningful feedback. Nor does it explain why our student activities fee is significantly higher than that of our peers. UFB Vice Chair Julian De Georgia ’20 told The Herald that UFB plans to publish more detailed reports in the coming years. We hope that these reports will give a breakdown that makes it simple for students to see how their money is being used and lead to a more informed and sustained conversation about our activities fee.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In mid-November, The Herald <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/11/18/university-examines-lead-paint-donovan-house/">reported</a> the troubling news that residents in Donovan House, where one of the University’s special interest housing programs is located, discovered what they believed to be lead paint in areas of the dorm with chipped paint. Officials from Environmental Health and Safety inspected the residence and determined that, though the paint damage did perhaps reveal lead paint, it was unlikely to cause lead exposure. The University decided that the damaged areas would nonetheless be repainted over winter break. It is good to see the University respond rapidly to student concerns about lead paint found in campus residences. Nevertheless, it has become evident that the University needs to improve its policies regarding how it checks for lead paint, inform students about the status of lead paint in dormitories and communicate the procedures students should follow to avoid lead exposure.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be sure, even the slight chance of lead paint exposure is a serious problem. Though the University reported that the degree of paint damage found in Donovan House is not significant enough to constitute lead exposure, whenever paint becomes damaged in a building that predates 1978 — when federal law outlawed the use of lead paint — there is the potential for chipped coats of paint to expose old layers of lead paint. When this happens, it becomes possible for residents to inhale airborne lead paint particles. Since many of Brown’s residence halls were built before 1978, this is a possibility that all students should be made aware of. Lead poisoning can <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead">cause damage to the brain</a> and other vital organs and can lead to headaches, stomach aches and exhaustion, among other more serious illnesses. As one University professor put it in a research report <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/08/lead">press release</a> this fall, “there is no safe level of lead.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thus, it remains incredibly disconcerting that the critical task of ensuring campus residents are not subject to any level of lead exposure has essentially been left to residents themselves — with many largely unaware that this burden has fallen on them. Though the Office of Residential Life told The Herald that Facilities Management checks for exposed lead paint every May when students move out, this policy — as evidenced by the case of Donovan House — is in need of serious scrutiny. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the University acknowledges that wear and tear could cause paint chipping that would contribute to lead paint exposure throughout the school year — during which there are no procedural checks for lead paint — the University does not currently make students aware of the extent of this potential problem or provide them with resources for reporting issues during their time in the residence halls. While we commend the University for planning to move forward with factsheets for students that would clarify these issues, it is troubling that this was not done sooner. Furthermore, future communication on this issue should provide students with better clarity regarding the reporting process for lead paint exposure and should include detailed information about how students can follow up on this issue. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Moreover, since a Donovan House resident reported noticing the exact same lead paint exposure last year, it remains questionable whether or not this policy of checking for lead paint exposure every May even works successfully. We encourage the University to look into this potential oversight and remain transparent with students as it continues to modify and improve its policies on lead paint in residence halls. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The University is not alone in its struggles with lead paint prevalence. In 2015, Yale students in one residence hall <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2015/03/24/with-unsafe-lead-levels-69-res-college-rooms-repainted/">reported</a> decaying paint that was determined to have 15 times the level of lead at which paint is considered dangerous. In the end, Yale decided to repaint dozens of dorm rooms to fix the problem, but it failed to inform the current inhabitants of what was ocurring. Brown can learn a lot from Yale’s handling of the situation: It is unacceptable to expose students to hazardous environmental conditions, to put the burden of lead monitoring on students themselves and to hide episodes of chipped paint or degraded infrastructure from students.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While <a href="http://health.ri.gov/healthrisks/poisoning/lead/for/landlords/">state</a> and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lead/real-estate-disclosure">federal</a> laws mandate that sellers and landlords disclose any and all knowledge of the presence of lead-based paint in residences to homebuyers and renters, federal law exempts college dormitories from this practice. As such, we commend the University for being willing to include lead paint disclosures in housing contracts moving forward. These disclosures, however, are not enough. The University’s updated policy will be most effective when combined with a renewed look at Brown’s lead paint inspection policy and the provision of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>information on potential lead paint exposure. It is only with these improvements to Brown’s lead paint policy that we will be able to fully ensure that students do not live in fear and uncertainty about the health and safety of their living environments during their time at Brown.</span></p>

		<title>Editorial: Computer science department’s expansion is welcome news</title>
		<link>http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/12/05/editorial-computer-science-departments-expansion-welcome-news/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In late November, the Department of Computer Science announced that it would be embarking on the largest expansion in its four-decade history. As part of the endeavor, called “CS with Impact,” the department will hire 10 tenure-track faculty and five lecturers. The department also aims to elevate its interdisciplinary competencies, supporting new scholars with research interests in both computer science and other disciplines and enhancing collaborative computational research across departments. We applaud the department’s effort to bolster the size of its faculty and more intensely cultivate its research capabilities. In aggregate, the department’s expansion will benefit the entire student body: It will leave concentrators better prepared for positions in industry and academia, afford more opportunities for non-concentrators to gain exposure to computing and make the University a more attractive destination for faculty and prospective students. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In 2013, the Editorial Page Board recommended that “Brown students — regardless of goals, concentration or background in computers — should properly consider exploring the computer science department.” We are glad to see that student interest in the computer science department’s offerings has grown since then. The past decade has seen computer science explode in popularity among the University’s undergraduates. Between 2010 and 2018, the number of undergraduate concentrators in computer science ballooned from 48 to 248. (Computer science overtook economics as the <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/14/draft-wang-cs-most-popular-concentration/">most popular concentration in 2017</a>.) This academic year, 588 students — one in six undergraduates — have declared concentrations in computer science. The meteoric proliferation of undergraduate interest in the discipline is a true testament to the intellectual value, interdisciplinary utility and wide-ranging applicability of a Brown education in computer science. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Department of Computer Science has taken significant steps to broaden its appeal, accessibility and interdisciplinary reach in the past two years. In the fall of 2016, the Data Science Initiative — which includes the departments of computer science, mathematics, applied math and biostatistics — began offering a one-year master’s degree in data science. The Initiative also committed to hiring 10 new faculty members and expanding undergraduate course offerings in data science. A year later, the Department of Computer Science <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2017/10/23/computer-science-department-changes-degree-requirements/">made adjustments to its concentration requirements</a>, compelling concentrators to specialize in specific sub-disciplines — like artificial intelligence, data, security and computer architecture — as part of their computer science degree. And this spring, the department unveiled a <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/17/computer-science-offer-new-intro-track/">new introductory track</a> in computer science, offering three courses over three semesters as a less intensive alternative to the existing one- or two-course tracks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The department’s expansion will build on this progress nicely: A greater number of instructors will keep class sizes small, increase the scope and range of course offerings and give students the chance to work closely with faculty on research. Taken together, these recent changes will likely enable more students, concentrators and non-concentrators alike, to pursue computer science and tailor their experience to their particular needs and interests. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Across the country, universities have started to revamp their offerings in computer science. The University of California at Berkeley announced the establishment of a new Division of Data Science and Information in early November. Two months ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology made public plans to invest $1 billion in the creation of a new college of artificial intelligence, which will house 50 faculty members and award numerous fellowships to graduate students. In August, Penn began offering its Master of Computer and Information Technology — a graduate program for students without previous programming experience — entirely online. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given these emerging trends in higher education — and the swelling premium that researchers, administrators and students are placing on computing — the Department of Computer Science’s expansion will put Brown on a sustainable, competitive footing regarding its computer science offerings. We hope that this endeavor will allow both current students and future classes of Brunonians to forge strong relationships with new department faculty and exploit every opportunity to explore computer science and its myriad applications, from introductory coursework to high-level research. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a Nov. 16 press release, the U.S. Department of Education proposed significant modifications to its existing Title IX regulations, the set of rules prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs that receive federal financial support. These proposed regulatory amendments come over 14 months after the Department of Education unveiled interim Title IX guidance that rolled back 2011 guidelines issued by the Obama administration, though those interim changes did not immediately affect the University’s Title IX policies. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Procedures for modifying government policy often seem like impenetrable technobabble, but we cannot overstate how much the fate of federal action on Title IX will affect the day-to-day lives and welfare of all members of the Brown community — students, faculty and staff alike. The DOE has afforded 60 days for public comment on its proposals, and the University has committed to soliciting feedback as part of its review of those new rules. In a community-wide email sent Nov. 16, President Christina Paxson P ’19 wrote that the University “anticipate(s) making comments — alone and/or with peer institutions — on any aspects of the regulations that might make our processes less fair and effective, or hinder our ability to support Brown community members who have experienced sexual harassment or assault.” In these 60 days, students at Brown have a vital opportunity to influence the trajectory of federal education policy, the implementation of Title IX policies on campus and civil rights outcomes on College Hill. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At a town hall held Thursday evening, students raised concerns about the ways in which the DOE’s proposed rule changes will affect the execution of Title IX policies across several dimensions. As The Herald previously reported, the rules will permit universities to use a “clear and convincing” standard of evidence — a higher bar than the “preponderance of evidence” standard allowed by the previous administration — when adjudicating cases of sexual assault. Further, the proposal will “adopt a clear definition of sexual harassment” and restrict universities’ ability to intervene only when alleged violations occur in their own “education program(s) or activities,” per the factsheet published by the DOE. Under these new rules, the DOE will also compel universities to presume innocence for the duration of the adjudication process, refrain from employing a single-investigator model and permit live hearings and cross-examinations of survivors. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Several national organizations and prominent individuals have criticized the DOE’s proposal. The American Civil Liberties Union stated that the rules would promote “an unfair process, inappropriately favoring the accused.” Janet Napolitano, former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that, in proposing its new rules, the DOE “is mistaken.” </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As the University works to craft an institutional response to the changes, Rene Davis, the University’s Title IX program officer, said that the administration will “consult with constituents across campus to review the guidance proposed and take in initial feedback.” The review process will include open forums and an electronic comment box that will be made available to students soon. At Thursday’s town hall, Davis recommended that students, in addition to attending town halls and submitting comments electronically to the University, also visit the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/11/29/2018-25314/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-sex-in-education-programs-or-activities-receiving-federal#open-comment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Register</a> and submit their comments to the DOE directly. We urge students to take full advantage of these avenues for feedback. While the 60-day comment period coincides with winter break — unideal circumstances for generating widespread public engagement — the cost of complacence, indifference and inaction is too high. According to its Annual Outcome Report, the University Office of Title IX and Gender Equity received 59 reports of sexual misconduct for the 2016-2017 school year. Across the country, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, an anti-sexual violence organization, finds that 11.2 percent of students (and 23.1 percent of female undergraduates) experience some kind of sexual violence. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We hope that, in the coming days, the University’s electronic comment form will be introduced and distributed widely. We also hope that the dates of future community forums, where the implications of the DOE’s revised Title IX guidance can be discussed, will be fixed soon and heavily publicized by the University. And we hope that students are able to set aside just a few minutes of their day, in this hectic season of finals and holidays, to provide feedback. The federal government will only accept comments until Jan. 28, 2019, which gives students around the nation just 52 days to express their views. But, altogether, every comment submitted, every voice raised and town hall attended, can make a difference in the process of amending existing Title IX policy — in the effort to make sure that all students at American universities are treated with equal dignity under the law.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2018, Thayer Street evolved, the 128th editorial board printed their first issue of The Herald and Datamatch circulated through campus. The location of the proposed Performing Arts Center changed, students gathered in solidarity with Parkland victims and Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor came to College Hill. Men’s Basketball hit a buzzer-beating shot against Dartmouth, students danced to Anderson .Paak and the Class of 2018 moved their tassels from right to left.

The Class of 2022 learned to love caffeine and the Ratty, acoustic tones filled the Underground on Thursdays and electric bikes and scooters appeared on every street corner. Students knocked on doors, phone banked and went to the polls (or the Mail Room); the faces of Congress changed. Community members showed support for Christine Blasey Ford and the University commemorated the 1968 black student walkout. Graduate students unionized; and the 128th editorial board printed their 122nd and final issue of The Herald.
