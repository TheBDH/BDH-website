	<p>The Brown Daily Herald publishes submissions in the form of op-eds and letters to the editor.</p>

	<p>All submissions to The Herald cannot have been previously published elsewhere 
	(in print or online — including personal blogs and social media), and they must be exclusive to The Herald.</p>

	<p>As of fall 2016, submissions must include no more than two individual authors. If there are more than two original authors, 
	The Herald can acknowledge the authors in a statement at the end of the letter or op-ed, but the byline can only include up to 
	two names. The Herald will not publish submissions authored by groups. The Herald does not publish anonymous submissions. 
	If you feel your circumstances prevent you from submitting an op-ed or letter with your name, please email us at 
	<a href="mailto:herald@browndailyherald.com"> herald@browndailyherald.com</a> to explain your situation.</p>

	<p>When you email your submission, please include (1) your full name, (2) an evening or mobile phone number 
	in case your submission is chosen for publication and (3) any affiliation with Brown University or any institution 
	or organization relevant to the content of your submission.</p>

	<p>Please send in submissions at least 24 hours in advance of your desired publication date. The Herald only publishes 
	submissions while it is in print. The Herald reserves the right to edit all submissions. If your piece is considered for 
	publication, an editor will contact you to discuss potential changes to your submission. You may be asked to come into the 
	office to review edits to your submission. Once your submission is published in The Herald, The Brown Daily Herald, Inc. 
	owns the copyright to the materials. </p>
	<br/>
	<h3>Op-eds</h3>
	<br/>
	<p>Op-eds are typically between 750 and 1000 words, though we will consider submissions between 500 and 1200 words. 
	Op-eds are meant to prompt new discussions on campus or frame new arguments about current discourse. They should be 
	written by members of the Brown community or relevant stakeholders in issues that are pertinent to campus life. 
	Op-eds should not be written in response to or as critiques of The Herald’s editorial decisions, though they can 
	present counter arguments to op-eds or columns published in The Herald. You can submit op-eds to 
	<a href="mailto:opinions@browndailyherald.com"> opinions@browndailyherald.com</a>. 
	Op-ed contributors are required to come into The Herald’s office to edit the op-ed. </p>
	<br/>
	<h3>Letters to the editor</h3>

	<p>Letters to the editor should be around 250 words. Letters to the editor respond to an article or column that has appeared 
	in The Herald, or they critique or commend The Herald’s editorial decisions. The Herald typically accepts letters written 
	by members of the Brown community or those covered in its reporting. You can submit letters to the editor to 
	<a href="mailto:letters@browndailyherald.com"> letters@browndailyherald.com</a>.</p>
